      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
      <p><strong>The first right is to be part of a community.</strong></p>
      <p>
        Codes of conduct often resemble Article 12 of the Colombian National Constitution: "No one shall be subjected to forced disappearance, torture, or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment."  
        When the Wayuu people, who endured 500 years of colonialism, translated this article, they wrote: 
        <em>"No one may cast aside another's heart or harm another, even if they think or say otherwise."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Bayes Plurinacional is a festive rite designed to create and renew our bonds. In community systems, conflicts are resolved through gestures, exchanges, and mutual aid.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the last principle of Buen Vivir (Aymara version) states: <em>Suma Churaña, Suma Katukaña</em>. We must learn to give and receive with joy and gratitude.
      </p>
