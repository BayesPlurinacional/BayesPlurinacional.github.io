        <em>Multi-species occupancy models with a Bayesian approach: a valuable tool for biodiversity studies in ecology</em>

        <ul>
          <li> <b>Summary:</b>
          Most studies based on observations of fauna and flora ignore that there is imperfect detection of organisms. Occupancy models take into account the probabilities of imperfect detection, where if a species is not observed at a point, it may be absent or it may not have been detected. These models can be implemented with a frequentist approach, but sometimes they are limited. In community studies, Bayesian approaches are very valuable because they allow modeling all species together, while evaluating the effects of other variables. These hierarchical multi-species occupancy models allow, in addition to modeling the imperfect detection of species, to improve inference by sharing information between species, which is especially important for those detected less frequently. In turn, it allows the incorporation of a hierarchical component of the community in the model, where the species-level parameters are treated as random effects guided by covariates. In this work, I will show how a Bayesian approach can be applied to study bird communities in agroecosystems through multi-species occupancy models over several years. It is my intention to disseminate this methodology by showing other applications in biodiversity studies in the field of ecology.

        <em>
          Bayesian Approach to Perceptual Decision Making and its Associated Confidence
        </em>
        <ul>
          <li> <b>Summary:</b>
          Humans constantly make decisions in contexts of uncertainty. These decisions do not occur in isolation: a certain degree of confidence in having made the correct decision accompanies them. In the laboratory, these decision-making and confidence processes are experimentally studied using perceptual tasks. In these tasks, participants are faced with perceptual stimuli and must make decisions based on them, reporting the degree of confidence in having made the correct decision. The experimental data obtained are then quantitatively compared with the predictions of various models proposed for these processes. In this talk, we propose to develop how Bayesian models, in particular, can be useful to account for how humans: 1) perceive the external world; 2) make decisions based on our sensory information; 3) assign a certain degree of confidence in these decisions. To do this, we will first present an introduction to Bayesian models for human decision-making. Then, we will develop a specific example of the application of Bayesian modeling to an experimental task of perceptual decision-making with confidence reports. Finally, we will discuss the degree of evidence that Bayesian models currently have as a model of the decision and confidence process of humans.

        <em>Bayesian retrieval scheme and its application to Cassini Mission SAR observations in an area of Titan, Saturn's largest moon.</em>

        <ul>
          <li> <b>Resumen:</b>
          Bayesian retrieval scheme and its application to Cassini Mission SAR observations in an area of Titan, Saturn's largest moon. In this work, a Bayesian retrieval scheme and its application to Cassini Mission SAR observations in an area between the Belet and Senkyo regions of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, will be presented. The scheme can estimate the Titan's surface parameters, and is based on the Small Perturbation Model (SPM) electromagnetic scattering model. The model assumes a stratified soil composed of two rough interfaces. Model parameters are different geometric and dielectric characteristics of Titan‚Äôs terrain. The overall retrieval scheme was implemented using PyMC, adopting the scattering model as the mean of the Likelihood. Using this retrieval scheme and the values of the backscattering coefficient and surface emissivity observed by the Cassini Huygens mission radar, the PDFs of the different geophysical parameters were estimated. Then, considerations about Titan‚Äôs surface were discussed. These analyses were based on the complete posterior probability distribution for every set of observations. Although these distributions showed considerable variance, it was feasible to determine which parameter combinations succeeded/failed to describe Titan's surface scattering properties despite the scarcity of the available data. Therefore, although in general it was not possible to univocally determine Titan's geophysical characteristics, it is possible to exclude ranges of surface parameters values which are impossible according to the available observations. Finally, based on synthetic data and the inference model, modifications for a future radar were proposed to better disambiguate the inference problem.

        <em>Sistemas fr√°giles: una formulaci√≥n bayesiana de la teor√≠a cu√°ntica.</em>

        <ul>
          <li> <b>Resumen:</b>
          Se presenta una reconstrucci√≥n del formalismo de la teor√≠a cu√°ntica a partir de la aplicaci√≥n de la teor√≠a de probabilidad Bayesiana a los sistemas "fr√°giles", esto es, sistemas que resultan afectados por la medici√≥n. En estos sistemas, dos mediciones consecutivas no conmutan, es decir, producen distinto resultado dependiendo del orden en que son ejecutadas. Los espacios de Hilbert complejos, los operadores que no conmutan y la regla de la traza para los valores de expectaci√≥n cu√°nticos aparecen de forma natural mediante el uso del √°lgebra lineal para resolver ecuaciones integrales que involucran probabilidades cl√°sicas sobre un conjunto de variables ocultas. Tambi√©n comentaremos la relevancia de nuestros resultados en el caso de variables ocultas no locales, donde es posible producir violaciones del teorema de Bell, y detallaremos el l√≠mite no fr√°gil de la teor√≠a, caso en el cual todas as mediciones conmutan y la teor√≠a se vuelve an√°loga a la estad√≠stica cl√°sica.

        <em>M√©todos basados en inferencia Bayesiana para la evaluaci√≥n de los mecan√≠smos vocales de la fonaci√≥n humana.</em>

        <ul>
          <li> <b>Resumen:</b>
          In this exposition, we will summarize different efforts in our group dedicated to developing new computational methods integrating physiological modeling and Bayesian inference for estimating clinically-relevant variables describing underlying mechanisms in typical and impaired human phonation. First, we will discuss why Bayesian estimation approaches are well-suited for the model-based assessment of biomedical processes. Key aspects to address will be the inherent solid theoretical framework, the advantage of incorporating a priori available information, and the possibility of obtaining desired information from (e.g., noisy, uncertain) clinical observations. Physiological models describing the salient phenomena and physical interactions provide the basis for obtaining the required a priori information. Then, we will introduce two original works in our research group that focus on combining physiological modeling and signal processing techniques for the clinical assessment of human phonation. We will present a state-space structural representation and Kalman filter scheme for analyzing the perturbed pitch period contours in voice signals. We will illustrate the results from the structural analysis of normal and pathological period contours. In addition, we will introduce a Bayesian estimator of vocal function measures based on the Extended Kalman filter and a biomechanical muscle-controlled model of the vocal folds. We will address a clinical study case with the non-invasive estimation of intrinsic muscle activation and subglottal pressure. The exposition will conclude by depicting ongoing efforts studying hierarchical stochastic models and constrained inference.

        <em>Computational Bayesian Modeling of Biological Systems.</em>

        <ul>
          <li> <b>Summary:</b>
          Computational Modeling of Biological Systems provides a guide to translate biological knowledge into mathematical equations that give rise to specially built computational models to predict experimental outcomes. In this way, it is possible to calculate the evidence that experimental data provide to alternative hypotheses. In the talk, I will show how this methodology was successfully applied in Immunology and Neuroscience. I will also talk about the different methods to calculate the elusive Bayesian Evidence.

          Evidence in Bayesian epistemology.
        </em>

        <ul>
          <li> <b>Summary:</b>
          The concept of evidence is fundamental to the philosophy of science and epistemology. From the tripartite proposal of knowledge as justified true belief, the problem of how we know is transferred, in part, to how we justify our beliefs. At this point, Bayesian epistemology tracciona between two traditional problems in epistemology, the nature of evidence and the updating of beliefs. In this talk we propose to address, first, these epistemological problems, the scopes and the sub-problems that generate at the moment of justifying a belief. Secondly, we will deal with the answers provided from a Bayesian approach: 1) the propositional nature of evidence; 2) coherentism as a theory of justification. Subsequently, we will outline the main difficulties that arise with this Bayesian perspective. Finally, we conclude by arguing that Bayesian epistemology treats evidence in a special way and with it improves the understanding of the justification of our beliefs and, therefore, readjusts problems within epistemology and the philosophy of science.

        <em>Generalized Bayesian Robust Methods for Logistic Regression Models.</em>

        <ul>
          <li> <b>Summary:</b>
          The present work studies the different advances of the last 15 years in the field of Economics, Statistics and Machine-Learning that allow us to speak of the existence of robust Bayesian methods. On the one hand, the work unifies within the same theoretical framework, notation and recent results that allow us to speak of a robust Bayesian statistics. In addition, it generates a robust Bayesian multinomial logistic regression model from the methods of variational inference based on robust loss functions and grounded by the Bayesian validity of the generalized posteriors. In this way, it is possible to represent in a generalized way the updating of beliefs in a model of discrete data without abandoning the Expected Utility criterion and at the same time represent our beliefs in the form of a robust subjective probability distribution. To do this, the loss function is adapted from the families of divergences studied by Ghosh and Futami and variational inference techniques are used to compute the posterior. Then the resulting robustness of the model is studied through computational simulations. Finally, the model is applied to the case of the 2019 National PASO Elections in the Province of Buenos Aires for the President category, comparing its results with robust frequentist methods and classical Bayesian models computed with the Monte Carlo Method.

        <em>Bayesian estimation for quantum sensing.</em>

        <ul>
          <li> <b>Summary:</b>
          Sensors based on individual quantum systems combine high sensitivity and spatial resolution in measuring physical quantities such as temperature, magnetic and electric field [1]. Quantum information protocols, such as quantum phase estimation, have been widely used to enhance the performance of quantum sensors. Such protocols have relied on detection of the quantum sensor in a single shot where the two states of the quantum system can be determined only with a single measurement.  However, in most practical applications only an averaged readout is available, as in the case of room-temperature sensing with the electron spin associated with a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Typically, in such cases many measurements are performed on the quantum system and the measurement results are converted into a binary outcome by using a threshold.
          <br>
          We show that, even in the case that single shot readout is not available, Bayesian estimation provides a natural way to efficiently use the available information. We apply Bayesian analysis to achieve an optimized sensing protocol for estimating a time-independent magnetic field with a single electron spin associated to a nitrogen vacancy center at room temperature and show that this protocol improves the sensitivity over previous protocols by more than a factor of 3 [2].<br>

        <em>Bayesian probability from the plausible estimation of quantities.</em>

        <ul>
          <li> <b>Summary:</b>
          Bayesian probability is usually justified from the axioms of Richard T. Cox (1948), which are requirements for the plausibility of a logical proposition. From these axioms it is possible to deduce the sum and product rules of probability. On the other hand, in this work it is shown how to deduce these rules (sum and product) from the idea of estimating an unknown quantity and some postulates that define this operation. The result is an alternative justification to that of Cox for Bayesian probabilities, in which these are estimates of the indicator functions associated with logical propositions. Examples will be presented of how this treatment can be more natural and in practice allow certain demonstrations in probability theory in a more direct way.

        <em>Bayesian regression for time series analysis with stacking in X-ray Astronomy.</em>

        <ul>
          <li> <b>Summary:</b>
          In X-ray Astronomy observational data is obtained using CCDs (Charge Coupled Devices) that capture photons individually. In each readout the device counts the electric charge traces that the photons leave in the pixels that make up its surface. Since the phenomenon of capturing a photon by the device is a random event, and since the photon flux is usually very low - of the order of an average photon per readout - the probability distribution that describes this process is that of Poisson. However the number of counts - that is, the traces that the photons leave in the CCD between readings - is usually less than the number of photons collected, since it may happen that more than one photon hits the same pixel or contiguous pixels, so that a single trace results, an effect known as stacking. In general, data that present stacking are usually avoided or discarded in order not to distort the statistics. However, this is not always possible, especially when it comes to identifying or characterizing very subtle phenomena. In this work we present a probability distribution obtained from the Poisson distribution that considers the effect of stacking and apply it to a Bayesian regression method of continuous piecewise functions. The objective is to have a code to be applied to time series capable of characterizing small variations in the photon collection rate in data that present stacking.

        <em>Bayesian Machine Learning Applied to Marketing.</em>

        <ul>
          <li> <b>Summary:</b>
          Models known as Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) seek to measure the impact of different marketing variables on sales, in order to help companies make optimal decisions. The most important variables to consider are media investment, price, distribution, competition actions and macroeconomic variables. With a good MMM model, it is possible to optimize sales, given budget constraints, finding the optimal mix of media investment under different scenarios.
          <br>
          However, building the model presents a great difficulty, as it is an overdetermined nonlinear regression problem, which means that the number of parameters can be of the same order or greater than the amount of available data. Classical statistical approaches are not suitable due to the enormous space of possible models (hundreds of parameters). Therefore, the Bayesian approach plays a fundamental role in handling model construction. This is achieved by incorporating prior information about the parameters and other quantities of interest, including nonparametric components based on Gaussian processes to model implicit effects, and applying Bayesian training methods.
          <br>
          In this presentation, an introduction to MMMs will be made and it will be explained how to apply the Bayesian approach in practice.

        <em>Application of Bayesian methods in structural engineering.</em>
        
        <ul>
          <li> <b>Summary:</b>
          Structural engineering models the behavior of civil structures in advance to predict their possible demands. Bayesian inference allows, through probabilistic models, to incorporate the uncertainty related to the models and their parameters. In this talk, various applications of Bayesian inference in structural engineering are presented.
          One of the applications focuses on the variability of the mechanical properties of concrete and steel reinforcement in Colombia.
          An experimental database was used that includes monotonic axial tests on steel bars and axial compression tests on concrete. Through the PyMC3 library of Python and the experimental data, the Raynor model of the monotonic stress-strain curve of steel was adjusted, as well as the equations proposed by the Colombian construction codes and ACI 318-19 for Ec.
          In another application, the parametric adjustment of structural models and the quantification of their uncertainty were carried out through the BILBY library of Python to adjust the finite element model corresponding to a five-story reinforced concrete
          building.
          In the third application, human-structure interaction models were evaluated with the aim of obtaining a less complex model that can be applied in design methodologies, thus achieving safer designs in the face of variability in anthropogenic solicitations.
