      <h1 class="text-center">Code of Conduct</h1>
      <h3 class="text-center lead"><strong>The first right is to be part of a community.</strong></h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Codes of conduct often resemble Article 12 of the National Constitution of Colombia:
        <div class="intro-section">
        "No one shall be subjected to enforced disappearance, torture, or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment."
        </div>
        When the Wayúu indigenous people, who endured 500 years of colonialism in Colombia, had to translate this article, they wrote:
        <div class="intro-section">
        "No one shall carry another above their heart or harm them in their person, even if they think and speak differently."
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        The accumulated experience of the world's most diverse communities has independently led to a universal obligation to give and receive, and the development of reciprocity technologies that reactivate bonds through exchange rituals (festive or coercive). The Bayes Plurinational event itself is a festive ritual aimed at creating and recreating our bonds.
        When conflicts arise, communities resolve them by activating the three possible types of relationships: (->) gestures, acts, or gifts that the causing party offers to the affected party; (<- ->) mutual exchange between both parties, renewing the cycle of exchanges; (<-) and assistance that the affected party offers to the causing party to modify the behaviors that led to the conflict.
