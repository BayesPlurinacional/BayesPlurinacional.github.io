                <li><b>Summary:</b> This talk describes the process of inferring cosmological parameters using Bayes' Theorem. First, the Einstein equations are introduced to build the standard cosmological model <em>LambdaCDM</em>. To analyze the data from Supernovas observations, the calculation of the distance to luminous objects known as the <em>theoretical distance modulus</em> is defined. Second, the information obtained from the supernovas and the procedure to parameterize the observable distance modulus through intrinsic properties of the same are presented. Third, through Bayes' Theorem, the statistical comparison between the prediction of the LambdaCDM model and the distance modulus of the supernovas is established. Specifically, restrictions will be imposed on the total matter parameter of the universe, and the question is posed: what is the most probable value of the amount of matter in the universe, given the supernova data?. Finally, the use of Bayesian statistics in other cosmological contexts will be mentioned.</li>

                <li><b>Summary:</b> The Cuban vaccine Abdala was designed by the Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology of Cuba, to control the COVID-19 epidemic. It was implemented in a vaccination campaign in people ‚â• 19 years old, in Havana, during May-July 2021. Objective: To evaluate the impact of vaccination on the incidence, severity, and mortality of COVID-19, in Havana, Cuba, from July to October 2021. Method: A longitudinal causal impact study was carried out in Havana, Cuba. The entire population of Havana, 2,137,936 inhabitants, was included, and the Bayesian Structural Time Series model (BSTS) was applied to obtain the impact of vaccination with the Abdala vaccine in the short term, with the calculation of the difference (counterfactual), between the observed time series of incidence, severity, and mortality, and what would have happened if the vaccination had not been intervened. The time series of incidence, severity, and mortality of the provinces of Camag√ºey and Holgu√≠n in the same period of time were used as control series, 95.0% probabilistic intervals were used. Results: In the absence of the intervention, an average value of weekly incidence of 151 cases was expected, instead, 22 were observed, with a relative reduction of 54.0%, the 95.0% counterfactual interval was (-70; -38). Severity did not show significant changes in the short term. However, mortality showed an expected value of around 3 weekly deaths on average, the observed value was 2, with a reduction from the moment of the intervention of 36.0%, interval (-56; -14). Conclusions: The impact of vaccination showed a reduction in the indicators of incidence, severity, and death from COVID-19 in Havana, Cuba.</li>

                <li><b>Summary:</b> In recent years, the use of Deep Learning to explain the behavior of natural neural systems has begun to gain strength. However, these models lack dynamics and do not usually correctly represent the uncertainty of their predictions. Our cerebral cortex, on the other hand, presents a rich dynamics and allows us to navigate in a world in which the information we receive from our senses is always partial and incomplete. In this talk, I will tell you about how to train recurrent neural networks under biological constraints, to approximate an ideal Bayesian observer. Surprisingly, from this purely computational objective, typical dynamic characteristics of the visual cortex emerge, such as gamma oscillations and transient responses with overshoot. These types of models allow us to advance in the understanding of the links between physiology and sensory perception.</li>
