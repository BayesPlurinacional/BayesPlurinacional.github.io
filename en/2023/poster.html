      âœ¨ Recommendations for Poster Preparation
    </h1>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Size and orientation</em>: It is recommended to use an A0 size for the poster, with a vertical (portrait) orientation. This will provide enough space to display and highlight the contents.</li>
            <li><em>Structure</em>: An effective poster should have a clear and organized structure. It is suggested to divide the poster into sections such as introduction, methodology, results, conclusions, and references. Use clear titles and subtitles for each section and ensure that the information flows naturally.</li>
            <li><em>Concise content</em>: The goal of a poster is to accompany the conversation. Therefore, it is suggested to communicate the key points of your work concisely and effectively. Avoid filling the poster with dense and extensive text. Use bullet points, short phrases, and graphics to summarize the most important findings.</li>
            <li><em>Design and aesthetics</em>: The design of the poster is crucial to capture the attention of viewers. Use colors and legible and attractive fonts. Avoid using fonts that are too small, as they make reading difficult from a distance. Use images, graphics, and tables to make the content more interesting and understandable.</li>
            <li><em>References</em>: If it is necessary to cite bibliographic sources, include a references section at the end of the poster. Make sure to follow a consistent citation style and use the "biblio.bib" file provided to manage the references.</li>
        </ul>     

    <h2>LaTex format</h2>

      <br>
      There are no restrictions regarding the format. For those who wish, <a href="http://bayesdelsur.com.ar/poster/latex.zip" target="_blank">we offer a compressed folder to generate a poster in LaTex format.</a>
      Make sure you have LaTeX installed on your system.
      Open a terminal and navigate to the folder location.
      To compile the poster, run "make compile" or read the file for more information.
      This procedure executes the compilation, including the generation of the bibliography, and will generate a PDF file of the poster.

      We hope that these recommendations and the instructions provided are useful for the preparation of your poster. Good luck with your presentation at the conference!
