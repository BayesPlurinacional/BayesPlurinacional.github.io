Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Influenza may result in primary pneumonia or be associated with secondary bacterial pneumonia. While the association with secondary pneumonia has been established ecologically, individual-level evidence remains sparse and the risk period for pneumonia following influenza poorly defined. Methods. We conducted a matched case-control study and a prospective cohort study among Nicaraguan children aged 0–14 years from 2011 through 2018. Physicians diagnosed pneumonia cases based on Integrated Management for Childhood Illness guidelines. Cases were matched with up to 4 controls on age (months) and study week. We fit conditional logistic regression models to assess the association between influenza subtype and subsequent pneumonia development, and a Bayesian nonlinear survival model to estimate pneumonia hazard following influenza. Results. Participants with influenza had greater risk of developing pneumonia in the 30 days following onset compared to those without influenza (matched odds ratio [mOR], 2.7 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.9–3.9]). Odds of developing pneumonia were highest for participants following A(H1N1)pdm09 illness (mOR, 3.7 [95% CI, 2.0–6.9]), followed by influenza B and A(H3N2). Participants’ odds of pneumonia following influenza were not constant, showing distinct peaks 0–6 days (mOR, 8.3 [95% CI, 4.8–14.5] days) and 14–20 (mOR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.1–5.5] days) after influenza infection. Conclusions. Influenza is a significant driver of both primary and secondary pneumonia among children. The presence of distinct periods of elevated pneumonia risk in the 30 days following influenza supports multiple etiological pathways. © The Author(s) 2020.","<b>Vulnerability of the agricultural sector to climate change: The development of a pan-tropical Climate Risk Vulnerability Assessment to inform sub-national decision making<\/b><br><br>As climate change continues to exert increasing pressure upon the livelihoods and agricultural sector of many developing and developed nations, a need exists to understand and prioritise at the sub national scale which areas and communities are most vulnerable. The purpose of this study is to develop a robust, rigorous and replicable methodology that is flexible to data limitations and spatially prioritizes the vulnerability of agriculture and rural livelihoods to climate change. We have applied the methodology in Vietnam, Uganda and Nicaragua, three contrasting developing countries that are particularly threatened by climate change. We conceptualize vulnerability to climate change following the widely adopted combination of sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity. We used Ecocrop and Maxent ecological models under a high emission climate scenario to assess the sensitivity of the main food security and cash crops to climate change. Using a participatory approach, we identified exposure to natural hazards and the main indicators of adaptive capacity, which were modelled and analysed using geographic information systems. We finally combined the components of vulnerability using equal-weighting to produce a crop specific vulnerability index and a final accumulative score. We have mapped the hotspots of climate change vulnerability and identified the underlying driving indicators. For example, in Vietnam we found the Mekong delta to be one of the vulnerable regions due to a decline in the climatic suitability of rice and maize, combined with high exposure to flooding, sea level rise and drought. However, the region is marked by a relatively high adaptive capacity due to developed infrastructure and comparatively high levels of education. The approach and information derived from the study informs public climate change policies and actions, as vulnerability assessments are the bases of any National Adaptation Plans (NAP), National Determined Contributions (NDC) and for accessing climate finance. © 2019 Parker et al.

We aim to use multiband imaging from the Phase-3 Verification Data of the J-PLUS survey to derive accurate photometric redshifts (photo-z) and look for potential new members in the surroundings of the nearby galaxy clusters A2589 (z = 0.0414) & A2593 (z = 0.0440), using redshift probability distribution functions (PDFs). The ultimate goal is to demonstrate the usefulness of a 12-band filter system in the study of largescale structure in the local Universe. Methods. We present an optimized pipeline for the estimation of photometric redshifts in clusters of galaxies. This pipeline includes a PSF-corrected photometry, specific photometric apertures capable of enhancing the integrated signal in the bluest filters, a careful recalibration of the photometric uncertainties and accurate upper-limit estimations for faint detections. To foresee the expected precision of our photo-z beyond the spectroscopic sample, we designed a set of simulations in which real cluster galaxies are modeled and reinjected inside the images at different signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) levels, recomputing their photometry and photo-z estimates. Results. We tested our photo-z pipeline with a sample of 296 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members with an averaged magnitude of (r) = 16.6 and redshift (z) = 0.041. The combination of seven narrow and five broadband filters with a typical photometric-depth of r ∼ 21.5 provides δ z /(1 + z) = 0.01 photo-z estimates. A precision of δ z /(1 + z) = 0.005 is obtained for the 177 galaxies brighter than magnitude r < 17. Based on simulations, a δ z /(1 + z) = 0.02 and δ z /(1 + z) = 0.03 is expected at magnitudes (r) = 18 and (r) = 22, respectively. Complementarily, we used SDSS/DR12 data to derive photo-z estimates for the same galaxy sample. This exercise demonstrates that the wavelength-resolution of the J-PLUS data can double the precision achieved by SDSS data for galaxies with a high S/N. Based on the Bayesian membership analysis carried out in this work, we find as much as 170 new candidates across the entire field (∼5 deg 2 ). The spatial distribution of these galaxies may suggest an overlap between the systems with no evidence of a clear filamentary structure connecting the clusters. This result is supported by X-ray Rosat All-Sky Survey observations suggesting that a hypothetical filament may have low density contrast on diffuse warm gas. Conclusions. We prove that the addition of the seven narrow-band filters make the J-PLUS data deeper in terms of photo-z-depth than other surveys of a similar photometric-depth but using only five broadbands. These preliminary results show the potential of J-PLUS data to revisit membership of groups and clusters from nearby galaxies, important for the determination of luminosity and mass functions and environmental studies at the intermediate and low-mass regime. © ESO 2019.","<b>Epidemiological evidence for lineage-specific differences in the risk of inapparent Chikungunya virus infection<\/b><br><br>In late 2013, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was introduced into the Americas, leading to widespread epidemics. A large epidemic caused by the Asian chikungunya virus (CHIKV) lineage occurred in Managua, Nicaragua, in 2015. Literature reviews commonly state that the proportion of inapparent CHIKV infections ranges from 3 to 28%. This study estimates the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic CHIKV infections and identifies risk factors of infection. In October to November 2015, 60 symptomatic CHIKV-infected children were enrolled as index cases and prospectively monitored, alongside 236 household contacts, in an index cluster study. Samples were collected upon enrollment and on day 14 or 35 and tested by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR), IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (IgM-ELISAs), and inhibition ELISAs to detect pre- and postenrollment CHIKV infections. Of 236 household contacts, 55 (23%) had experienced previous or very recent infections, 41 (17%) had active infections at enrollment, and 21 (9%) experienced incident infections. Vehicle ownership (multivariable-adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.58) increased the risk of CHIKV infection, whereas 4 municipal trash collections/ week (aRR, 0.38) and having externally piped water (aRR, 0.52) protected against CHIKV infection. Among 63 active and incident infections, 31 (49% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 36%, 62%]) were asymptomatic, yielding a ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic infections of 1:0.97 (95% CI, 1:0.56, 1:1.60). Although our estimate is outside the 3% to 28% range reported previously, Bayesian and simulation analyses, informed by a systematic literature search, suggested that the proportion of inapparent CHIKV infections is lineage dependent and that more inapparent infections are associated with the Asian lineage than the East/Central/South African (ECSA) lineage. Overall, these data substantially improve knowledge regarding chikungunya epidemics. Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

However, cross-cultural research examining media influence on body ideals is typically confounded by differences in the availability of reliable and diverse foodstuffs. 112 participants were recruited from 3 Nicaraguan villages that differed in television consumption and nutritional status, such that the contribution of both factors could be revealed. Participants completed a female figure preference task, reported their television consumption, and responded to several measures assessing nutritional status. Communities with higher television consumption and/or higher nutritional status preferred thinner female bodies than communities with lower television consumption and/or lower nutritional status. Bayesian mixed models estimated the plausible range of effects for television consumption, nutritional status, and other relevant variables on individual preferences. The model explained all meaningful differences between our low-nutrition villages, and television consumption, after sex, was the most likely of these predictors to contribute to variation in preferences (probability mass >95% when modelling only variables with zero-order associations with preferences, but only 90% when modelling all possible predictors). In contrast, we found no likely link with nutritional status. We thus found evidence that where media access and nutritional status are confounded, media is the more likely predictor of body ideals. © 2017 The Author(s).","<b>Climate change adaptation of coffee production in space and time<\/b><br><br>Coffee is grown in more than 60 tropical countries on over 11 million ha by an estimated 25 million farmers, most of whom are smallholders. Several regional studies demonstrate the climate sensitivity of coffee (Coffea arabica) and the likely impact of climate change on coffee suitability, yield, increased pest and disease pressure and farmers’ livelihoods. The objectives of this paper are (i) to quantify the impact of progressive climate change to grow coffee and to produce high quality coffee in Nicaragua and (ii) to develop an adaptation framework across time and space to guide adaptation planning. We used coffee location and cup quality data from Nicaragua in combination with the Maxent and CaNaSTA crop suitability models, the WorldClim historical data and the CMIP3 global circulation models to predict the likely impact of climate change on coffee suitability and quality. We distinguished four different impact scenarios: Very high (coffee disappears), high (large negative changes), medium (little negative changes) and increase (positive changes) in climate suitability. During the Nicaraguan coffee roundtable, most promising adaptation strategies were identified, which we then used to develop a two-dimensional adaptation framework for coffee in time and space. Our analysis indicates that incremental adaptation may occur over short-term horizons at lower altitudes, whereas the same areas may undergo transformative adaptation in the longer term. At higher elevations incremental adaptation may be needed in the long term. The same principle and framework is applicable across coffee growing regions around the world. © 2016, The Author(s).","<b>Vulnerability to climate change of cocoa in West Africa: Patterns, opportunities and limits to adaptation<\/b><br><br>The West African cocoa belt, reaching from Sierra Leone to southern Cameroon, is the origin of about 70% of the world's cocoa (Theobroma cacao), which in turn is the basis of the livelihoods of about two million farmers. We analyze cocoa's vulnerability to climate change in the West African cocoa belt, based on climate projections for the 2050s of 19 Global Circulation Models under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change intermediate emissions scenario RCP 6.0. We use a combination of a statistical model of climatic suitability (Maxent) and the analysis of individual, potentially limiting climate variables. We find that: 1) contrary to expectation, maximum dry season temperatures are projected to become as or more limiting for cocoa as dry season water availability; 2) to reduce the vulnerability of cocoa to excessive dry season temperatures, the systematic use of adaptation strategies like shade trees in cocoa farms will be necessary, in reversal of the current trend of shade reduction; 3) there is a strong differentiation of climate vulnerability within the cocoa belt, with the most vulnerable areas near the forest-savanna transition in Nigeria and eastern Côte d'Ivoire, and the least vulnerable areas in the southern parts of Cameroon, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire and Liberia; 4) this spatial differentiation of climate vulnerability may lead to future shifts in cocoa production within the region, with the opportunity of partially compensating losses and gains, but also the risk of local production expansion leading to new deforestation. We conclude that adaptation strategies for cocoa in West Africa need to focus at several levels, from the consideration of tolerance to high temperatures in cocoa breeding programs, the promotion of shade trees in cocoa farms, to policies incentivizing the intensification of cocoa production on existing farms where future climate conditions permit and the establishment of new farms in already deforested areas. © 2016 The Authors.","<b>In search of the source of the 1865–1866 nicaraguan earthquakes: Paleoseismic data from the cofradía fault, managua graben (Nicaragua)<\/b><br><br>In 1865–1866, a series of catastrophic earthquakes struck Managua, Nicaragua. We present new data supporting the view that these earthquakes were caused by the seismogenic Cofradía fault. The data were collected at three paleoseismological sites: La Vaquería (central-northern area), El Cocal (central area), and Piedra Menuda (located at an antithetic strand of the southern fault segment). Coseis-mic evidence includes liquefaction features, offset layers, and colluvial wedges dated using radiocarbon ages and pottery fragments, providing relative cultural ages. The minimum event displacement observed at the central site (1 m) and the total length of the mapped geomorphological trace (39 km) are consistent with a maximum expected magnitude around 7. A minimum slip rate between 1.1 and 1:4 mm=yr is obtained from the new data, reinforcing earlier estimates. In line with paleoseismic chronology and compared with a Bayesian OxCal model of the stratigraphic sequence, at least three seismic events have occurred since A.D. 300, the last one occurring after A.D. 790 and the twentieth century. Thus, the earthquakes of 1865–1866 that resulted in surface alterations in the Tipitapa River probably correspond to the last paleoseismic event on the Cofradía fault. This assumption yields a range between 1511 and 1245 yr for the best estimated maximum recurrence interval between the ultimate and penultimate event. © 2016, Seismological Society of America.

Cocoa contributes 7.5 % of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Côte d'Ivoire and 3.4 % of that of Ghana and is an important cash crop for the rural population in the forest zones of these countries. If progressive climate change affected the climatic suitability for cocoa in West Africa, this would have implications for global cocoa output as well as the national economies and farmer livelihoods, with potential repercussions for forests and natural habitat as cocoa growing regions expand, shrink or shift. The objective of this paper is to present future climate scenarios for the main cocoa growing regions of Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire and to predict their impact on the relative suitability of these regions for growing cocoa. These analyses are intended to support the respective countries and supply chain actors in developing strategies for reducing the vulnerability of the cocoa sector to climate change. Based on the current distribution of cocoa growing areas and climate change predictions from 19 Global Circulation Models, we predict changes in relative climatic suitability for cocoa for 2050 using an adapted MAXENT model. According to the model, some current cocoa producing areas will become unsuitable (Lagunes and Sud-Comoe in Côte d'Ivoire) requiring crop change, while other areas will require adaptations in agronomic management, and in yet others the climatic suitability for growing cocoa will increase (Kwahu Plateu in Ghana and southwestern Côte d'Ivoire). We recommend the development of site-specific strategies to reduce the vulnerability of cocoa farmers and the sector to future climate change. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."],"shape":["dot","dot","dot","dot","dot","dot","dot","dot","dot","dot","dot","dot","dot","dot","dot","dot","dot"],"color":["#3366CC","#3366CC","#3366CC","#3366CC","#3366CC","#3366CC","#3366CC","#3366CC","#CC6633","#CC6633","#CC6633","#CC6633","#CC6633","#CC6633","#CC6633","#CC6633","#CC6633"],"doi":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"10.1093/cid/ciaa1053","10.1371/journal.pone.0213641","10.1051/0004-6361/201731348","10.1128/JVI.01622-18","10.1038/s41598-017-08653-z","10.1007/s10584-016-1788-9","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.024","10.1785/0120150067","10.1007/s10584-013-0774-8"],"issn":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"10584838","19326203","00046361","0022538X","20452322","01650009","00489697","00371106","01650009"],"abstract":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Background.

Vehicle ownership (multivariable-adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.58) increased the risk of CHIKV infection, whereas 4 municipal trash collections/ week (aRR, 0.38) and having externally piped water (aRR, 0.52) protected against CHIKV infection. Among 63 active and incident infections, 31 (49% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 36%, 62%]) were asymptomatic, yielding a ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic infections of 1:0.97 (95% CI, 1:0.56, 1:1.60). Although our estimate is outside the 3% to 28% range reported previously, Bayesian and simulation analyses, informed by a systematic literature search, suggested that the proportion of inapparent CHIKV infections is lineage dependent and that more inapparent infections are associated with the Asian lineage than the East/Central/South African (ECSA) lineage. Overall, these data substantially improve knowledge regarding chikungunya epidemics. Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

However, cross-cultural research examining media influence on body ideals is typically confounded by differences in the availability of reliable and diverse foodstuffs. 112 participants were recruited from 3 Nicaraguan villages that differed in television consumption and nutritional status, such that the contribution of both factors could be revealed. Participants completed a female figure preference task, reported their television consumption, and responded to several measures assessing nutritional status. Communities with higher television consumption and/or higher nutritional status preferred thinner female bodies than communities with lower television consumption and/or lower nutritional status. Bayesian mixed models estimated the plausible range of effects for television consumption, nutritional status, and other relevant variables on individual preferences. The model explained all meaningful differences between our low-nutrition villages, and television consumption, after sex, was the most likely of these predictors to contribute to variation in preferences (probability mass >95% when modelling only variables with zero-order associations with preferences, but only 90% when modelling all possible predictors). In contrast, we found no likely link with nutritional status. We thus found evidence that where media access and nutritional status are confounded, media is the more likely predictor of body ideals. © 2017 The Author(s).","Coffee is grown in more than 60 tropical countries on over 11 million ha by an estimated 25 million farmers, most of whom are smallholders. Several regional studies demonstrate the climate sensitivity of coffee (Coffea arabica) and the likely impact of climate change on coffee suitability, yield, increased pest and disease pressure and farmers’ livelihoods. The objectives of this paper are (i) to quantify the impact of progressive climate change to grow coffee and to produce high quality coffee in Nicaragua and (ii) to develop an adaptation framework across time and space to guide adaptation planning. We used coffee location and cup quality data from Nicaragua in combination with the Maxent and CaNaSTA crop suitability models, the WorldClim historical data and the CMIP3 global circulation models to predict the likely impact of climate change on coffee suitability and quality. We distinguished four different impact scenarios: Very high (coffee disappears), high (large negative changes), medium (little negative changes) and increase (positive changes) in climate suitability. During the Nicaraguan coffee roundtable, most promising adaptation strategies were identified, which we then used to develop a two-dimensional adaptation framework for coffee in time and space. Our analysis indicates that incremental adaptation may occur over short-term horizons at lower altitudes, whereas the same areas may undergo transformative adaptation in the longer term. At higher elevations incremental adaptation may be needed in the long term. The same principle and framework is applicable across coffee growing regions around the world. © 2016, The Author(s).","The West African cocoa belt, reaching from Sierra Leone to southern Cameroon, is the origin of about 70% of the world's cocoa (Theobroma cacao), which in turn is the basis of the livelihoods of about two million farmers. We analyze cocoa's vulnerability to climate change in the West African cocoa belt, based on climate projections for the 2050s of 19 Global Circulation Models under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change intermediate emissions scenario RCP 6.0. We use a combination of a statistical model of climatic suitability (Maxent) and the analysis of individual, potentially limiting climate variables. We find that: 1) contrary to expectation, maximum dry season temperatures are projected to become as or more limiting for cocoa as dry season water availability; 2) to reduce the vulnerability of cocoa to excessive dry season temperatures, the systematic use of adaptation strategies like shade trees in cocoa farms will be necessary, in reversal of the current trend of shade reduction; 3) there is a strong differentiation of climate vulnerability within the cocoa belt, with the most vulnerable areas near the forest-savanna transition in Nigeria and eastern Côte d'Ivoire, and the least vulnerable areas in the southern parts of Cameroon, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire and Liberia; 4) this spatial differentiation of climate vulnerability may lead to future shifts in cocoa production within the region, with the opportunity of partially compensating losses and gains, but also the risk of local production expansion leading to new deforestation. We conclude that adaptation strategies for cocoa in West Africa need to focus at several levels, from the consideration of tolerance to high temperatures in cocoa breeding programs, the promotion of shade trees in cocoa farms, to policies incentivizing the intensification of cocoa production on existing farms where future climate conditions permit and the establishment of new farms in already deforested areas. © 2016 The Authors.","In 1865–1866, a series of catastrophic earthquakes struck Managua, Nicaragua. We present new data supporting the view that these earthquakes were caused by the seismogenic Cofradía fault. The data were collected at three paleoseismological sites: La Vaquería (central-northern area), El Cocal (central area), and Piedra Menuda (located at an antithetic strand of the southern fault segment). Coseis-mic evidence includes liquefaction features, offset layers, and colluvial wedges dated using radiocarbon ages and pottery fragments, providing relative cultural ages. The minimum event displacement observed at the central site (1 m) and the total length of the mapped geomorphological trace (39 km) are consistent with a maximum expected magnitude around 7. A minimum slip rate between 1.1 and 1:4 mm=yr is obtained from the new data, reinforcing earlier estimates. In line with paleoseismic chronology and compared with a Bayesian OxCal model of the stratigraphic sequence, at least three seismic events have occurred since A.D. 300, the last one occurring after A.D. 790 and the twentieth century. Thus, the earthquakes of 1865–1866 that resulted in surface alterations in the Tipitapa River probably correspond to the last paleoseismic event on the Cofradía fault. This assumption yields a range between 1511 and 1245 yr for the best estimated maximum recurrence interval between the ultimate and penultimate event. © 2016, Seismological Society of America.

Cocoa contributes 7.5 % of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Côte d'Ivoire and 3.4 % of that of Ghana and is an important cash crop for the rural population in the forest zones of these countries. If progressive climate change affected the climatic suitability for cocoa in West Africa, this would have implications for global cocoa output as well as the national economies and farmer livelihoods, with potential repercussions for forests and natural habitat as cocoa growing regions expand, shrink or shift. The objective of this paper is to present future climate scenarios for the main cocoa growing regions of Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire and to predict their impact on the relative suitability of these regions for growing cocoa. These analyses are intended to support the respective countries and supply chain actors in developing strategies for reducing the vulnerability of the cocoa sector to climate change. Based on the current distribution of cocoa growing areas and climate change predictions from 19 Global Circulation Models, we predict changes in relative climatic suitability for cocoa for 2050 using an adapted MAXENT model. According to the model, some current cocoa producing areas will become unsuitable (Lagunes and Sud-Comoe in Côte d'Ivoire) requiring crop change, while other areas will require adaptations in agronomic management, and in yet others the climatic suitability for growing cocoa will increase (Kwahu Plateu in Ghana and southwestern Côte d'Ivoire). We recommend the development of site-specific strategies to reduce the vulnerability of cocoa farmers and the sector to future climate change. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media
