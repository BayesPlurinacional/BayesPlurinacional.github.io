Contrary to conventional livestock, genetic resources of farmed insects remain poorly characterised. We present the first comprehensive population genetic characterisation of H. illucens. Based on 15 novel microsatellite markers, we genotyped and analysed 2862 individuals from 150 wild and captive populations originating from 57 countries on seven subcontinents. Results: We identified 16 well-distinguished genetic clusters indicating substantial global population structure. The data revealed genetic hotspots in central South America and successive northwards range expansions within the indigenous ranges of the Americas. Colonisations and naturalisations of largely unique genetic profiles occurred on all non-native continents, either preceded by demographically independent founder events from various single sources or involving admixture scenarios. A decisive primarily admixed Polynesian bridgehead population serially colonised the entire Australasian region and its secondarily admixed descendants successively mediated invasions into Africa and Europe. Conversely, captive populations from several continents traced back to a single North American origin and exhibit considerably reduced genetic diversity, although some farmed strains carry distinct genetic signatures. We highlight genetic footprints characteristic of progressing domestication due to increasing socio-economic importance of H. illucens, and ongoing introgression between domesticated strains globally traded for large-scale farming and wild populations in some regions. Conclusions: We document the dynamic population genetic history of a cosmopolitan dipteran of South American origin shaped by striking geographic patterns. These reflect both ancient dispersal routes, and stochastic and heterogeneous anthropogenic introductions during the last century leading to pronounced diversification of worldwide structure of H. illucens. Upon the recent advent of its agronomic commercialisation, however, current human-mediated translocations of the black soldier fly largely involve genetically highly uniform domesticated strains, which meanwhile threaten the genetic integrity of differentiated unique local resources through introgression. Our in-depth reconstruction of the contemporary and historical demographic trajectories of H. illucens emphasises benchmarking potential for applied future research on this emerging model of the prospering insect-livestock sector. © 2021, The Author(s).","<b>Retraction: Bayesian networks applied to climate conditions inside a naturally ventilated greenhouse (IOP Conf.

Bayesian networks are numerical uncertainty techniques that can be used to study this problem. A set of experimental data was obtained: air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, and CO2 concentration at one and three meters above the ground in the growing space. The data set was discretized and used to develop a Bayesian Network model that describes the relationships between the studied variables.

Their brood parasitic lifestyle has led to the evolution of fascinating adaptations, including chemical mimicry of host odours by some species. Long-term nomenclatural stability of the higher taxonomic units (e.g. genera, tribes, and subfamilies) in this family and a thorough understanding of the family's evolutionary history critically depend on a robust phylogeny of cuckoo wasps. Here we present the results from phylogenetically analysing ten nuclear-encoded genes and one mitochondrial gene, all protein-coding, in a total of 186 different species of cuckoo wasps representing most major cuckoo wasp lineages. The compiled data matrix comprised 4946 coding nucleotide sites and was phylogenetically analysed using classical maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. The results of our phylogenetic analyses are mostly consistent with earlier ideas on the phylogenetic relationships of the cuckoo wasps' subfamilies and tribes, but cast doubts on the hitherto hypothesized phylogenetic position of the subfamily Amiseginae. However, the molecular data are not fully conclusive in this respect due to low branch support values at deep nodes. In contrast, our phylogenetic estimates clearly indicate that the current systematics of cuckoo wasps at the genus level is artificial. Several of the currently recognized genera are para- or polyphyletic (e.g. Cephaloparnops, Chrysis, Chrysura, Euchroeus, Hedychridium, Praestochrysis, Pseudochrysis, Spintharina, and Spinolia). At the same time, our data support the validity of the genus Colpopyga, previously synonymized with Hedychridium. We discuss possible solutions for how to resolve the current shortcomings in the systematics of cuckoo wasp genera and decided to grant Prospinolia the status of a valid genus (Prospinolia stat.n.) and transferring Spinolia theresae [du Buysson 1900] from Spinolia to Prospinolia (Prospinolia theresae stat.restit.). We discuss the implications of our phylogenetic inferences for understanding the evolution of host associations in this group. The results of our study not only shed new light on the evolutionary history of cuckoo wasps, but also set the basis for future phylogenomic investigations on this captivating group of wasps by guiding taxonomic sampling efforts and the design of probes for target DNA enrichment approaches. © 2018 The Royal Entomological Society","<b>Species distribution modelling and cpSSR reveal population history of the Neotropical annual herb Tithonia rotundifolia (Asteraceae)<\/b><br><br>The impacts of the historical geologic and climatic events on the diversity and genetic structure of Neotropical taxa have recently become a subject of study. However, annual plants associated with tropical dry forests remain under-studied. The exploration of additional taxa in contrasting environments will improve the current understanding of responses of the Neotropical biota to these events. Here, we explore the species distribution and geographic structure of the annual herb Tithonia rotundifolia. We sampled 175 individuals from 19 populations of T. rotundifolia. Species distribution modelling and six microsatellite chloroplast loci were used to infer its population history. We identified areas of historical climate suitability and then tested if there is genetic structuring among these areas. Haplotypes showed strong phylogeographic structure. Historical climatic suitability areas were found along the Pacific coast; however, a gap was found at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (IT). Although Bayesian analysis showed population structuring, amova revealed that the IT is not its main driver. Instead, a subdivision into a higher number of regions had higher F CT values. Also, populations to the east of the IT showed evidence of recent population expansion and migration in a south–north direction. Pleistocene climate fluctuations partially explain the geographic structure of T. rotundifolia. However, life-history characteristics such as limited seed dispersal and the patchy distribution of suitable habitats explain the high haplotype diversity and population sub-structuring and diversity. Lastly, the absence of geographic structure of some haplotypes may indicate long-distance dispersal, or hybridisation with the closely related T. tubaeformis. © 2018 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands","<b>The ungulates of honduras<\/b><br><br>The distribution and ecology of the five species of ungulates that occur in Honduras, Tapirus bairdii (Danto or Tapir) of the Tapiridae family, Pecari tajacu (Quequeo, Chancho de Monte) and Tayassu pecari (Jagüilla) of the Tayassuidae family, and Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer) and Mazama temama (Tilopo, Güisisil) from the Cervidae family, are presented. The history of the registration and monitoring of terrestrial mammals in Honduras is briefly narrated. Registration maps and potential distribution of the species, generated by the MaxEnt Program using presence records as a database for the analysis are presented. Spatial analysis is done through the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) that allow for the digitalization and measurement of distribution polygons. The analysis is complemented by the use of several layers that allow for ecological relationships, distribution percentages and threats. The distribution and ecology of the ungulates in Honduras is wide with particular characteristics of each species; they are found in buffer zones and core areas of protected areas and within private protected areas. The region of the Honduran Moskitia in the eastern part of Honduras records the presence of the five species indicating that ungulates share the same territories especially in areas of low human presence; this territory is considered as the genetic bank for these and other wild species. The threats faced by ungulates in general are the same, loss of vegetation, poaching, change of land use, and traffic. Genetic constitution is unknown, except for Tapirus bairdii where there is some phylogeny work. The future of ungulates in Honduras is uncertain, so it is recommended that governments and private organizations pay adequate attention by promoting conservation programs, scientific research, and laws that protect species and their areas of occurrence. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

Palmeri and P. Sonorae (Loranthaceae) remain uncertain. These mistletoe species exhibit morphological and phenological innovations probably related to their dry habitats, so that determining their phylogenetic position is key on the understanding of factors associated with the morphological evolution within Psittacanthus. Questions: (1) Is the evolution of some morphological innovations in the Bursera-host specialists associated with the ecological conditions linked to host diversification? (2) Does time of diversification in both lineages coincide? Study species: Fourteen species of Psittacanthus. Methods: Sequences of nuclear (ITS) and plastid (trnL-trnF) markers are analyzed with Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony methods, and molecular dating under a Bayesian approach estimated to elucidate the phylogenetic position and divergence timing of the Bursera-host specialists. Results: The Bursera-host specialists form a strongly supported clade, named here the 'Bursera group'. The divergence time for the Bursera-host specialists was estimated at 7.89 Ma. Interestingly, phylogenetic relationships between P. Nudus and P. Palmeri, as currently circumscribed, were not fully resolved, making P. Palmeri paraphyletic. Conclusions: Based on these results, the plants collected by the type locality of P. Nudus in Honduras should be named P. Palmeri. The seasonal deciduousness of P. Palmeri (including P. Nudus) and morphology of P. Sonorae (small size, fleshy leaves) are clearly adaptations to dry ecosystems where these species have lived for a long time. In parallel, the evolutionary history of these mistletoes seems to be correlated with the evolutionary history and diversification patterns of Bursera. © 2018 Sociedad Botanica de Mexico, A.C.

METHODS Using Sanger sequencing, we sequenced the exomes of six members of a large family affected with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and confirmed cosegregation in all 37 family members. We screened an additional 310 patients with this disorder for variants on DNA melting-curve analysis and targeted real-time DNA sequencing of the gene encoding intestinal-cell kinase (ICK). We calculated Bayesian logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores for cosegregating variants, odds ratios in case-control associations, and allele frequencies in the Genome Aggregation Database. We performed functional tests of the effects of variants on mitosis, apoptosis, and radial neuroblast migration in vitro and conducted video-EEG studies in mice lacking a copy of Ick. RESULTS A variant, K305T (c.914A→C), cosegregated with epilepsy or polyspikes on EEG in 12 members of the family affected with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. We identified 21 pathogenic ICK variants in 22 of 310 additional patients (7%). Four strongly linked variants (K220E, K305T, A615T, and R632X) impaired mitosis, cell-cycle exit, and radial neuroblast migration while promoting apoptosis. Tonic-clonic convulsions and polyspikes on EEG resembling seizures in human juvenile myoclonic epilepsy occurred more often in knockout heterozygous mice than in wild-type mice (P=0.02) during light sleep with isoflurane anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS Our data provide evidence that heterozygous variants in ICK caused juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in 7% of the patients included in our analysis. Variant ICK affects cell processes that help explain microdysgenesis and polyspike networks observed on EEG in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).

We reanalyzed 54 EFHC1 variants associated with epilepsy from 17 cohorts based on National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants.Methods:We calculated Bayesian LOD scores for variants in coinheritance, unconditional exact tests and odds ratios (OR) in case-control associations, allele frequencies in genome databases, and predictions for conservation/pathogenicity. We reviewed whether variants damage EFHC1 functions, whether efhc1-/-KO mice recapitulate CTC convulsions and \"microdysgenesis\" neuropathology, and whether supernumerary synaptic and dendritic phenotypes can be rescued in the fly model when EFHC1 is overexpressed. We rated strengths of evidence and applied ACMG combinatorial criteria for classifying variants.Results:Nine variants were classified as \"pathogenic,\" 14 as \"likely pathogenic,\" 9 as \"benign,\" and 2 as \"likely benign.\" Twenty variants of unknown significance had an insufficient number of ancestry-matched controls, but ORs exceeded 5 when compared with racial/ethnic-matched Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) controls.Conclusions:NHGRI gene-level evidence and variant-level evidence establish EFHC1 as the first non-ion channel microtubule-associated protein whose mutations disturb R-type VDCC and TRPM2 calcium currents in overgrown synapses and dendrites within abnormally migrated dislocated neurons, thus explaining CTC convulsions and \"microdysgenesis\" neuropathology of JME. © American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.","<b>Selection of the best regression model to explain the variables that influence labor accident electrical company case<\/b><br><br>The present research proposes an alternative to select the best model that explains the relation of the variables that influence the labor accident in an electric power company.

Data from nineteen morphological traits and CO1 and 28S gene sequences were used to construct phylogenies using both parsimony and Bayesian algorithms. All results show that Trichiotinus is monophyletic. The best supported topology shows that the basal species T. lunulatus is sister to the remaining taxa that form two clades, with four and three species each. The distribution of one lineage is relatively northern while the other is generally more southern. The ancestral Trichiotinus lineage arose from 23.8-14.9 mya, and east-west geographic partitioning of ancestral populations likely resulted in cladogenesis and new species creation, beginning as early as 10.6-6.2 mya and as recently as 1.2-0.7 mya. Morphological character evolution is also briefly discussed. The limited distribution of T. rufobrunneus in Florida and T. viridans in the Midwest mainly due to urban development and widespread agriculture makes these two species of conservation concern. © 2016 T.

However, species delimitation is problematic in many taxa, including ' non-adaptive radiations ' containing morphologically cryptic lineages. Fortunately, coalescent-based species delimitation methods hold promise for objectively estimating species limits in such radiations, using multilocus genetic data. Using coalescent-based approaches, we delimit species and infer evolutionary relationships in a morphologically conserved group of Central American freshwater fishes, the Poecilia sphenops species complex. Phylogenetic analyses of multiple genetic markers (sequences of two mitochondrial DNA genes and five nuclear loci) from 10/15species and genetic lineages recognized in the group support the P. sphenops species complex as monophyletic with respect to outgroups, with eight mitochondrial 'major-lineages' diverged by ≥2% pairwise genetic distances. From general mixed Yule-coalescent models, we discovered (conservatively) 10 species within our concatenated mitochondrial DNA dataset, 9 of which were strongly supported by subsequent multilocus Bayesian species delimitation and species tree analyses. Results suggested species-level diversity is underestimated or overestimated by at least ∼15%in different lineages in the complex. Nonparametric statistics and coalescent simulations indicate genealogical discordance among our gene tree results has mainly derived from interspecific hybridization in the nuclear genome. However, mitochondrial DNA show little evidence for introgression, and our species delimitation results appear robust to effects of this process. Overall, our findings support the utility of combining multiple lines of genetic evidence and broad phylogeographical sampling to discover and validate species using coalescent-based methods. Our study also highlights the importance of testing for hybridization versus incomplete lineage sorting, which aids inference of not only species limits but also evolutionary processes influencing genetic diversity. © 2015 Bagley et al.","<b>A single early introduction of HIV-1 subtype b into central america accounts for most current cases<\/b><br><br>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variants show considerable geographical separation across the world, but there is limited information from Central America. We provide the first detailed investigation of the genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in six Central American countries. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on 625 HIV-1 pol gene sequences collected between 2002 and 2010 in Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, and Belize. Published sequences from neighboring countries (n=57) and the rest of the world (n=740) were included as controls. Maximum likelihood methods were used to explore phylogenetic relationships. Bayesian coalescence-based methods were used to time HIV-1 introductions. Nearly all (98.9%) Central American sequences were of subtype B. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 437 (70%) sequences clustered within five significantly supported monophyletic clades formed essentially by Central American sequences. One clade contained 386 (62%) sequences from all six countries; the other four clades were smaller and more country specific, suggesting discrete subepidemics. The existence of one large well-supported Central American clade provides evidence that a single introduction of HIV-1 subtype B in Central America accounts for most current cases. An introduction during the early phase of the HIV-1 pandemic may explain its epidemiological success. Moreover, the smaller clades suggest a subsequent regional spread related to specific transmission networks within each country. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.","<b>Social network-based recruitment successfully reveals HIV-1 transmission networks among high-risk individuals in El Salvador<\/b><br><br>OBJECTIVE: HIV in Central America is concentrated among certain groups such as men who have sex with men (MSM) and female sex workers (FSWs). We compared social recruitment chains and HIV transmission clusters from 699 MSM and 787 FSWs to better understand factors contributing to ongoing HIV transmission in El Salvador. METHODS: Phylogenies were reconstructed using pol sequences from 119 HIV-positive individuals recruited by respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and compared with RDS chains in 3 cities in El Salvador. Transmission clusters with a mean pairwise genetic distance ≤0.015 and Bayesian posterior probabilities =1 were identified. Factors associated with cluster membership were evaluated among MSM. RESULTS: Sequences from 34 (43%) MSM and 4 (10%) FSW grouped in 14 transmission clusters. Clusters were defined by risk group (12 MSM clusters) and geographic residence (only 1 spanned separate cities). In 4 MSM clusters (all n = 2), individuals were also members of the same RDS chain, but only 2 had members directly linked through recruitment. All large clusters (n ≥ 3) spanned >1 RDS chain. Among MSM, factors independently associated with cluster membership included recent infection by BED assay (P = 0.02), sex with stable male partners (P = 0.02), and sex with ≥3 male partners in the past year (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: We found few HIV transmissions corresponding directly with the social recruitment. However, we identified clustering in nearly one-half of MSM suggesting that RDS recruitment was indirectly but successfully uncovering transmission networks, particularly among recent infections.

Contrary to conventional livestock, genetic resources of farmed insects remain poorly characterised. We present the first comprehensive population genetic characterisation of H. illucens. Based on 15 novel microsatellite markers, we genotyped and analysed 2862 individuals from 150 wild and captive populations originating from 57 countries on seven subcontinents. Results: We identified 16 well-distinguished genetic clusters indicating substantial global population structure. The data revealed genetic hotspots in central South America and successive northwards range expansions within the indigenous ranges of the Americas. Colonisations and naturalisations of largely unique genetic profiles occurred on all non-native continents, either preceded by demographically independent founder events from various single sources or involving admixture scenarios. A decisive primarily admixed Polynesian bridgehead population serially colonised the entire Australasian region and its secondarily admixed descendants successively mediated invasions into Africa and Europe. Conversely, captive populations from several continents traced back to a single North American origin and exhibit considerably reduced genetic diversity, although some farmed strains carry distinct genetic signatures. We highlight genetic footprints characteristic of progressing domestication due to increasing socio-economic importance of H. illucens, and ongoing introgression between domesticated strains globally traded for large-scale farming and wild populations in some regions. Conclusions: We document the dynamic population genetic history of a cosmopolitan dipteran of South American origin shaped by striking geographic patterns. These reflect both ancient dispersal routes, and stochastic and heterogeneous anthropogenic introductions during the last century leading to pronounced diversification of worldwide structure of H. illucens. Upon the recent advent of its agronomic commercialisation, however, current human-mediated translocations of the black soldier fly largely involve genetically highly uniform domesticated strains, which meanwhile threaten the genetic integrity of differentiated unique local resources through introgression. Our in-depth reconstruction of the contemporary and historical demographic trajectories of H. illucens emphasises benchmarking potential for applied future research on this emerging model of the prospering insect-livestock sector. © 2021, The Author(s).","This work was originally published in Spanish (1) and has been translated and published without permission or acknowledgement to the original authors.

Bayesian networks are numerical uncertainty techniques that can be used to study this problem. A set of experimental data was obtained: air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, and CO2 concentration at one and three meters above the ground in the growing space. The data set was discretized and used to develop a Bayesian Network model that describes the relationships between the studied variables. The model shows the differences that allow to identify the degree of dependence of the variables, as well as to quantify their inference. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Cuckoo wasps (Hymenoptera: Chrysididae) are a species-rich family of obligate brood parasites (i.e. parasitoids and kleptoparasites) whose hosts range from sawflies, wasps and bees, to walking sticks and moths. Their brood parasitic lifestyle has led to the evolution of fascinating adaptations, including chemical mimicry of host odours by some species. Long-term nomenclatural stability of the higher taxonomic units (e.g. genera, tribes, and subfamilies) in this family and a thorough understanding of the family's evolutionary history critically depend on a robust phylogeny of cuckoo wasps. Here we present the results from phylogenetically analysing ten nuclear-encoded genes and one mitochondrial gene, all protein-coding, in a total of 186 different species of cuckoo wasps representing most major cuckoo wasp lineages. The compiled data matrix comprised 4946 coding nucleotide sites and was phylogenetically analysed using classical maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. The results of our phylogenetic analyses are mostly consistent with earlier ideas on the phylogenetic relationships of the cuckoo wasps' subfamilies and tribes, but cast doubts on the hitherto hypothesized phylogenetic position of the subfamily Amiseginae. However, the molecular data are not fully conclusive in this respect due to low branch support values at deep nodes. In contrast, our phylogenetic estimates clearly indicate that the current systematics of cuckoo wasps at the genus level is artificial. Several of the currently recognized genera are para- or polyphyletic (e.g. Cephaloparnops, Chrysis, Chrysura, Euchroeus, Hedychridium, Praestochrysis, Pseudochrysis, Spintharina, and Spinolia). At the same time, our data support the validity of the genus Colpopyga, previously synonymized with Hedychridium. We discuss possible solutions for how to resolve the current shortcomings in the systematics of cuckoo wasp genera and decided to grant Prospinolia the status of a valid genus (Prospinolia stat.n.) and transferring Spinolia theresae [du Buysson 1900] from Spinolia to Prospinolia (Prospinolia theresae stat.restit.). We discuss the implications of our phylogenetic inferences for understanding the evolution of host associations in this group. The results of our study not only shed new light on the evolutionary history of cuckoo wasps, but also set the basis for future phylogenomic investigations on this captivating group of wasps by guiding taxonomic sampling efforts and the design of probes for target DNA enrichment approaches. © 2018 The Royal Entomological Society","The impacts of the historical geologic and climatic events on the diversity and genetic structure of Neotropical taxa have recently become a subject of study. However, annual plants associated with tropical dry forests remain under-studied. The exploration of additional taxa in contrasting environments will improve the current understanding of responses of the Neotropical biota to these events. Here, we explore the species distribution and geographic structure of the annual herb Tithonia rotundifolia. We sampled 175 individuals from 19 populations of T. rotundifolia. Species distribution modelling and six microsatellite chloroplast loci were used to infer its population history. We identified areas of historical climate suitability and then tested if there is genetic structuring among these areas. Haplotypes showed strong phylogeographic structure. Historical climatic suitability areas were found along the Pacific coast; however, a gap was found at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (IT). Although Bayesian analysis showed population structuring, amova revealed that the IT is not its main driver. Instead, a subdivision into a higher number of regions had higher F CT values. Also, populations to the east of the IT showed evidence of recent population expansion and migration in a south–north direction. Pleistocene climate fluctuations partially explain the geographic structure of T. rotundifolia. However, life-history characteristics such as limited seed dispersal and the patchy distribution of suitable habitats explain the high haplotype diversity and population sub-structuring and diversity. Lastly, the absence of geographic structure of some haplotypes may indicate long-distance dispersal, or hybridisation with the closely related T. tubaeformis. © 2018 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands","The distribution and ecology of the five species of ungulates that occur in Honduras, Tapirus bairdii (Danto or Tapir) of the Tapiridae family, Pecari tajacu (Quequeo, Chancho de Monte) and Tayassu pecari (Jagüilla) of the Tayassuidae family, and Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer) and Mazama temama (Tilopo, Güisisil) from the Cervidae family, are presented. The history of the registration and monitoring of terrestrial mammals in Honduras is briefly narrated. Registration maps and potential distribution of the species, generated by the MaxEnt Program using presence records as a database for the analysis are presented. Spatial analysis is done through the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) that allow for the digitalization and measurement of distribution polygons. The analysis is complemented by the use of several layers that allow for ecological relationships, distribution percentages and threats. The distribution and ecology of the ungulates in Honduras is wide with particular characteristics of each species; they are found in buffer zones and core areas of protected areas and within private protected areas. The region of the Honduran Moskitia in the eastern part of Honduras records the presence of the five species indicating that ungulates share the same territories especially in areas of low human presence; this territory is considered as the genetic bank for these and other wild species. The threats faced by ungulates in general are the same, loss of vegetation, poaching, change of land use, and traffic. Genetic constitution is unknown, except for Tapirus bairdii where there is some phylogeny work. The future of ungulates in Honduras is uncertain, so it is recommended that governments and private organizations pay adequate attention by promoting conservation programs, scientific research, and laws that protect species and their areas of occurrence. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

These mistletoe species exhibit morphological and phenological innovations probably related to their dry habitats, so that determining their phylogenetic position is key on the understanding of factors associated with the morphological evolution within Psittacanthus. Questions: (1) Is the evolution of some morphological innovations in the Bursera-host specialists associated with the ecological conditions linked to host diversification? (2) Does time of diversification in both lineages coincide? Study species: Fourteen species of Psittacanthus. Methods: Sequences of nuclear (ITS) and plastid (trnL-trnF) markers are analyzed with Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony methods, and molecular dating under a Bayesian approach estimated to elucidate the phylogenetic position and divergence timing of the Bursera-host specialists. Results: The Bursera-host specialists form a strongly supported clade, named here the 'Bursera group'. The divergence time for the Bursera-host specialists was estimated at 7.89 Ma. Interestingly, phylogenetic relationships between P. Nudus and P. Palmeri, as currently circumscribed, were not fully resolved, making P. Palmeri paraphyletic. Conclusions: Based on these results, the plants collected by the type locality of P. Nudus in Honduras should be named P. Palmeri. The seasonal deciduousness of P. Palmeri (including P. Nudus) and morphology of P. Sonorae (small size, fleshy leaves) are clearly adaptations to dry ecosystems where these species have lived for a long time. In parallel, the evolutionary history of these mistletoes seems to be correlated with the evolutionary history and diversification patterns of Bursera. © 2018 Sociedad Botanica de Mexico, A.C.

METHODS Using Sanger sequencing, we sequenced the exomes of six members of a large family affected with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and confirmed cosegregation in all 37 family members. We screened an additional 310 patients with this disorder for variants on DNA melting-curve analysis and targeted real-time DNA sequencing of the gene encoding intestinal-cell kinase (ICK). We calculated Bayesian logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores for cosegregating variants, odds ratios in case-control associations, and allele frequencies in the Genome Aggregation Database. We performed functional tests of the effects of variants on mitosis, apoptosis, and radial neuroblast migration in vitro and conducted video-EEG studies in mice lacking a copy of Ick. RESULTS A variant, K305T (c.914A→C), cosegregated with epilepsy or polyspikes on EEG in 12 members of the family affected with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. We identified 21 pathogenic ICK variants in 22 of 310 additional patients (7%). Four strongly linked variants (K220E, K305T, A615T, and R632X) impaired mitosis, cell-cycle exit, and radial neuroblast migration while promoting apoptosis. Tonic-clonic convulsions and polyspikes on EEG resembling seizures in human juvenile myoclonic epilepsy occurred more often in knockout heterozygous mice than in wild-type mice (P=0.02) during light sleep with isoflurane anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS Our data provide evidence that heterozygous variants in ICK caused juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in 7% of the patients included in our analysis. Variant ICK affects cell processes that help explain microdysgenesis and polyspike networks observed on EEG in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).

We reanalyzed 54 EFHC1 variants associated with epilepsy from 17 cohorts based on National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants.Methods:We calculated Bayesian LOD scores for variants in coinheritance, unconditional exact tests and odds ratios (OR) in case-control associations, allele frequencies in genome databases, and predictions for conservation/pathogenicity. We reviewed whether variants damage EFHC1 functions, whether efhc1-/-KO mice recapitulate CTC convulsions and \"microdysgenesis\" neuropathology, and whether supernumerary synaptic and dendritic phenotypes can be rescued in the fly model when EFHC1 is overexpressed. We rated strengths of evidence and applied ACMG combinatorial criteria for classifying variants.Results:Nine variants were classified as \"pathogenic,\" 14 as \"likely pathogenic,\" 9 as \"benign,\" and 2 as \"likely benign.\" Twenty variants of unknown significance had an insufficient number of ancestry-matched controls, but ORs exceeded 5 when compared with racial/ethnic-matched Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) controls.Conclusions:NHGRI gene-level evidence and variant-level evidence establish EFHC1 as the first non-ion channel microtubule-associated protein whose mutations disturb R-type VDCC and TRPM2 calcium currents in overgrown synapses and dendrites within abnormally migrated dislocated neurons, thus explaining CTC convulsions and \"microdysgenesis\" neuropathology of JME. © American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.","The present research proposes an alternative to select the best model that explains the relation of the variables that influence the labor accident in an electric power company. Among the techniques and tools used are those of occupational safety and health management, multivariate statistics, generalized linear models, the values of the deviation percentage explained and the adjusted percentage and the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. The following variables were identified through the mentioned techmques, management commitment compliance with legislation, prevention planning, training in prevention, updating of occupational risk management and policies that have a significant influence on work accident and through. The percentages and of the previously mentioned criteria were able to show that the logistic regression is the best model that explaim the labor accident by presenting the hghest percentage and the lowest values of the criteria when compared with the poisson regression and negative binomial models. © Medwell Journals, 2017.","A hypothesized evolutionary history of the North American endemic trichiine scarab genus Trichiotinus is presented including all eight species and three outgroup taxa. Data from nineteen morphological traits and CO1 and 28S gene sequences were used to construct phylogenies using both parsimony and Bayesian algorithms. All results show that Trichiotinus is monophyletic. The best supported topology shows that the basal species T. lunulatus is sister to the remaining taxa that form two clades, with four and three species each. The distribution of one lineage is relatively northern while the other is generally more southern. The ancestral Trichiotinus lineage arose from 23.8-14.9 mya, and east-west geographic partitioning of ancestral populations likely resulted in cladogenesis and new species creation, beginning as early as 10.6-6.2 mya and as recently as 1.2-0.7 mya. Morphological character evolution is also briefly discussed. The limited distribution of T. rufobrunneus in Florida and T. viridans in the Midwest mainly due to urban development and widespread agriculture makes these two species of conservation concern. © 2016 T. Keith Philips et al.","Accurately delimiting species is fundamentally important for understanding species diversity and distributions and devising effective strategies to conserve biodiversity. However, species delimitation is problematic in many taxa, including ' non-adaptive radiations ' containing morphologically cryptic lineages. Fortunately, coalescent-based species delimitation methods hold promise for objectively estimating species limits in such radiations, using multilocus genetic data. Using coalescent-based approaches, we delimit species and infer evolutionary relationships in a morphologically conserved group of Central American freshwater fishes, the Poecilia sphenops species complex. Phylogenetic analyses of multiple genetic markers (sequences of two mitochondrial DNA genes and five nuclear loci) from 10/15species and genetic lineages recognized in the group support the P. sphenops species complex as monophyletic with respect to outgroups, with eight mitochondrial 'major-lineages' diverged by ≥2% pairwise genetic distances. From general mixed Yule-coalescent models, we discovered (conservatively) 10 species within our concatenated mitochondrial DNA dataset, 9 of which were strongly supported by subsequent multilocus Bayesian species delimitation and species tree analyses. Results suggested species-level diversity is underestimated or overestimated by at least ∼15%in different lineages in the complex. Nonparametric statistics and coalescent simulations indicate genealogical discordance among our gene tree results has mainly derived from interspecific hybridization in the nuclear genome. However, mitochondrial DNA show little evidence for introgression, and our species delimitation results appear robust to effects of this process. Overall, our findings support the utility of combining multiple lines of genetic evidence and broad phylogeographical sampling to discover and validate species using coalescent-based methods. Our study also highlights the importance of testing for hybridization versus incomplete lineage sorting, which aids inference of not only species limits but also evolutionary processes influencing genetic diversity. © 2015 Bagley et al.","Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variants show considerable geographical separation across the world, but there is limited information from Central America. We provide the first detailed investigation of the genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in six Central American countries. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on 625 HIV-1 pol gene sequences collected between 2002 and 2010 in Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, and Belize. Published sequences from neighboring countries (n=57) and the rest of the world (n=740) were included as controls. Maximum likelihood methods were used to explore phylogenetic relationships. Bayesian coalescence-based methods were used to time HIV-1 introductions. Nearly all (98.9%) Central American sequences were of subtype B. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 437 (70%) sequences clustered within five significantly supported monophyletic clades formed essentially by Central American sequences. One clade contained 386 (62%) sequences from all six countries; the other four clades were smaller and more country specific, suggesting discrete subepidemics. The existence of one large well-supported Central American clade provides evidence that a single introduction of HIV-1 subtype B in Central America accounts for most current cases. An introduction during the early phase of the HIV-1 pandemic may explain its epidemiological success. Moreover, the smaller clades suggest a subsequent regional spread related to specific transmission networks within each country. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.","OBJECTIVE: HIV in Central America is concentrated among certain groups such as men who have sex with men (MSM) and female sex workers (FSWs). We compared social recruitment chains and HIV transmission clusters from 699 MSM and 787 FSWs to better understand factors contributing to ongoing HIV transmission in El Salvador. METHODS: Phylogenies were reconstructed using pol sequences from 119 HIV-positive individuals recruited by respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and compared with RDS chains in 3 cities in El Salvador. Transmission clusters with a mean pairwise genetic distance ≤0.015 and Bayesian posterior probabilities =1 were identified. Factors associated with cluster membership were evaluated among MSM. RESULTS: Sequences from 34 (43%) MSM and 4 (10%) FSW grouped in 14 transmission clusters. Clusters were defined by risk group (12 MSM clusters) and geographic residence (only 1 spanned separate cities). In 4 MSM clusters (all n = 2), individuals were also members of the same RDS chain, but only 2 had members directly linked through recruitment. All large clusters (n ≥ 3) spanned >1 RDS chain. Among MSM, factors independently associated with cluster membership included recent infection by BED assay (P = 0.02), sex with stable male partners (P = 0.02), and sex with ≥3 male partners in the past year (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: We found few HIV transmissions corresponding directly with the social recruitment. However, we identified clustering in nearly one-half of MSM suggesting that RDS recruitment was indirectly but successfully uncovering transmission networks, particularly among recent infections. Interrogating RDS chains with phylogenetic analyses may help refine methods for identifying transmission clusters.
