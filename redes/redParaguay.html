However, there is still no consensus on the causes of their demise. Here, we use the fossil record and Bayesian diversification models to infer the origination and extinction rates for Sparassodonta. Then, we evaluate if their demise can be attributed to global temperature changes, Andean uplift, biotic interactions with their competitor and prey clades, and body mass evolution. That is biotic aspects in the context of the Red Queen model, abiotic aspects in the context of the Court Jester model, and an intrinsic lineage attribute. Our results show that this lineage is characterized by a positive near-zero net diversification rate indicating that the clade maintained a relatively low but stable diversity until the Middle Miocene when an increase in extinction rate drove them to decline and eventual extinction. Moreover, our results support the idea that a drastic regional landscape change triggered by the Andean uplift process affected their diversification dynamics, eventually driving them to extinction. These environmental changes could explicitly affect Sparassodonta lineages due to their ever-present vulnerability to extinction by near-zero net diversification rate and their highly specialized ecology that could have constrained adaptation to new South American landscapes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","<b>A critical assessment of ex situ conservation based on the Brazilian avifauna: Are we focusing on what is easier?<\/b><br><br>Species have been lost at unprecedented rates. Because only a small fraction of the threatened taxa have been managed under human care, contrasting the characteristics of taxa that have, and have not been targeted to ex situ conservation can reveal the reach of this conservation strategy, and can indicate its main challenges. Here we investigated whether the level of threat, diet, body mass, phylogeny, and previous presence in captivity due to non-conservation purposes could be potential parameters accounting for the occurrence of Brazilian threatened avian species and subspecies in ex situ conservation facilities and for their eligibility to organized ex situ conservation plans. Using Bayesian phylogenetic comparative models we found positive effects of body mass and phylogeny, and a negative effect of insectivorous diet in the occurrence of the taxa in non-conservation facilities. The previous presence in non-conservation facilities, together with phylogeny, diet, and body mass were the main parameters accounting for the occurrence of the threatened taxa in ex situ conservation facilities, and the previous presence in non-conservation facilities and phylogeny explained the existence of organized ex situ conservation plans. This is evidence that conservation breeding facilities have mostly harbored threatened confiscated birds than choosing them based on scientific criteria. We suggest that investing in the development of husbandry techniques, especially for insectivorous passerines, and choosing taxa based on scientific criteria are important challenges that should be on the agenda of conservation managers. © 2022 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação","<b>A mathematical model for covid-19 with variable transmissibility and hospitalizations: A case study in paraguay<\/b><br><br>Forecasting the dynamics of the number of cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a given population is a challenging task due to behavioural changes which occur over short periods. Planning of hospital resources and containment measures in the near term require a scenario analysis and the use of predictive models to gain insight into possible outcomes for each scenario. In this paper, we present the SEIR-H epidemiological model for the spread dynamics in a given population and the impact of COVID-19 in the local health system. It was developed as an extension of the classic SEIR model to account for required hospital resources and behavioural changes of the population in response to containment measures. Time-varying parameters such as transmissibility are estimated using Bayesian methods, based on the database of reported cases with a moving time-window strategy. The assessment of the model offers reasonable results with estimated parameters and simulations, reflecting the observed dynamics in Paraguay. The proposed model can be used to simulate future scenarios and possible effects of containment strategies, to guide the public institution response based on the available resources in the local health system. © 2021 by the authors.

In this work, we propose a Bayesian optimization system dedicated to monitoring and estimating multiple water quality parameters simultaneously using a single autonomous surface vehicle. The proposed work combines different strategies and methods for this monitoring task, evaluating two approaches for acquisition function fusion: the coupled and the decoupled techniques. We also consider dynamic parametrization of the maximum measurement distance traveled by the ASV so that the monitoring system balances the total number of measurements and the total distance, which is related to the energy required. To evaluate the proposed approach, the Ypacarai Lake (Paraguay) serves as the test scenario, where multiple maps of water quality parameters, such as pH and dissolved oxygen, need to be obtained efficiently. The proposed system is compared with the predictive entropy search for multi-objective optimization with constraints (PESMOC) algorithm and the genetic algorithm (GA) path planning for the Ypacarai Lake scenario. The obtained results show that the proposed approach is 10.82% better than other optimization methods in terms of R2 score with noiseless measurements and up to 17.23% better when the data are noisy. Additionally, the proposed approach achieves a good average computational time for the whole mission when compared with other methods, 3% better than the GA technique and 46.5% better than the PESMOC approach. © 2021 by the authors.

From June to September 2017, coalescent sunken necrotic lesions were observed on the banana fruit cv. Tabasco (Musa acuminata), harvested in two orchards in Teapa, Tabasco, southeast of Mexico. Thus, this research aimed to identify the causal agents of necrotic lesions that affect banana production. Isolates of Colletotrichum spp. obtained from the sunken necrotic lesions were studied by morphological and multilocus phylogenetic approaches. Amplification and sequencing of the six (GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT, TUB, GS, and APMAT) partial genes were performed. Later, individual alignment for each gene was created and concatenated. Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses revealed that the three representative strains belong to C. chrysophilum, a member of C. gloeosporioides species complex. To determine whether C. chrysophilum strains were responsible for the symptoms on banana fruit, a pathogenicity test was conducted by inoculation of wounded fruit. Typical necrotic lesions were observed 8 days after inoculation, while the control fruit remained healthy. This finding represents the first report of C. chrysophilum causing anthracnose of banana in Mexico; therefore, it should be considered an integrated management program to reduce losses caused by this disease. © 2020, Deutsche Phytomedizinische Gesellschaft.","<b>Estimating contamination risk using artificial intelligence models a case of the patiño aquifer, Paraguay<\/b><br><br>Studying the risk of contamination is essential for the protection of aquifers. In Paraguay, one of the major drinking water supplies is the Patiño Aquifer. A previous study, using a deterministic model, identified that 42% of the aquifer have a high risk of contamination. This work uses artificial intelligence (AI) models, with regression and classification approaches, to estimate the contamination risk of the urban zone of the Patiño aquifer by Total Nitrogen (TN). The Supervised Committee Machine with Artificial Intelligence (SCMAI) model is applied as a regression model, which combines the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Mamdani Fuzzy Logic (MFL), Sugeno Fuzzy Logic (SFL) and Neuro Fuzzy (NF) models. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the correlation of estimated risk with TN concentration are used for the evaluation. The Decision Trees (DT), Bayesian Network (BN) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models are used for the low and not low risk classification approach. These models were evaluated based on the precision, recall and accuracy indicators. The SCMAI model improved the performance and correlation of the ANN, MFL and SFL models, with RMSE, MAE and correlation values of 2.33, 1.38 and 0.86 respectively. The J48 and PART algorithms, applied to the DT model, and the KNN model obtained an accuracy of 99%, and the BN model obtained an accuracy of 98%. Precision and recall values showed that the DT algorithms failed less, by 10%, and that it is able to identify 81% of the cases of the not low risk levels. It was observed that both approaches give a competent picture of the state of the Patiño aquifer in relation to the risk of contamination. © 20th International Conferences on WWW/Internet 2021 and Applied Computing 2021.","<b>A Bayesian Optimization Approach for Water Resources Monitoring through an Autonomous Surface Vehicle: The Ypacarai Lake Case Study<\/b><br><br>Bayesian Optimization is a sequential method for obtaining the maximum of an unknown function that has gained much popularity in recent years. Bayesian Optimization is commonly used to monitor the surface of large-scale aquatic environments using an Autonomous Surface Vehicle. We propose to model water quality parameters using Gaussian Processes, and propose three different adaptations of classical Acquisition Functions in order to explore an unknown space, considering surface vehicle restrictions. The proposed Sequential Bayesian Optimization system uses the aforementioned information in order to monitor the Lake and also to obtain a water quality model, which has an associated uncertainty map. For evaluation, the Mean Squared Error of the resulting approximated models are compared. Afterwards, they are compared with other monitoring algorithms, like the Traveling Salesman Problem, using Genetic Algorithms and Lawnmower. Concluding remarks indicate that the proposed method not only performs better while minimizing the Mean Squared Error (via active monitoring), but also manages to quickly identify an approximate of the black-box function, which is very useful for monitoring lakes like Ypacarai Lake ( 60\\: km^{2} ) in Paraguay. Additionally, the proposed method reduces the MSE by 25% when compared with Traveling Salesman Problem-based monitoring algorithms and also provides a more robust solution, i.e., 30% more independent of initial conditions, when compared with known robust coverage methods like the lawnmower method. © 2013 IEEE.","<b>Seasonality drives body size variation in a widely distributed Neotropical treefrog<\/b><br><br>It is well known that body size variation can be related to genetic and environmental factors and that this variation may occur among species, and among and within populations. Scinax fuscomarginatus is a widely distributed Neotropical anuran that occurs in open areas of several South American ecoregions, exposed to different climatic conditions and showing high levels of body size variation. We tested if this variation in body size is related to phylogeny or to any climatic condition to which populations are subjected. We measured the snout-vent length (SVL) of 285 individuals of S. fuscomarginatus from 37 populations, covering virtually all the known geographic distribution of the species. We constructed a phylogenetic tree under Bayesian inference based on mtDNA sequences to test for the existence of phylogenetic signal in body size variation and performed a multiple linear regression to examine the relationship between body size and environmental variables. Although S. fuscomarginatus shows a deep genetic structure, body size variation was randomly distributed across the phylogeny, indicating no phylogenetic signal. On the other hand, we found evidence that support some influence of climatic conditions in body size variation, being the precipitation seasonality and the temperature seasonality the most important variables. Our results are in accordance with the water conservation hypothesis, which predicts an increase in body size towards drier regions assuming that lower surface-to-volume ratio of larger bodies minimizes water loss by evaporation. © 2020 The Zoological Society of London","<b>Phylogeography of the Variable Antshrike (Thamnophilus caerulescens), a South American passerine distributed along multiple environmental gradients<\/b><br><br>The Neotropics show a wealth of distributional patterns shared by many co-distributed species. A distinctive pattern is the so-called “circum-Amazonian distribution,” which is observed in species that do not occur in Amazonia but rather along a belt of forested habitats spanning south and east of Amazonia, the Andean foothills, and often into the Venezuelan Coastal Range and the Tepuis. Although this pattern is widespread across animals and plants, its underlying biogeographic mechanisms remain poorly understood. The Variable Antshrike (Thamnophilus caerulescens) is a sexually dimorphic suboscine passerine that exhibits extreme plumage variation and occurs along the southern portion of the circum-Amazonian belt. We describe broad-scale phylogeographic patterns of T. caerulescens and assess its demographic history using DNA sequences from the mitochondrion and ultraconserved elements (UCEs). We identified three genomic clusters: a) northern Atlantic Forest; b) southeastern Cerrado and central-southern Atlantic Forest, and c) Chaco and Andes. Our results were consistent with Pleistocene divergence followed by gene flow, mainly between the latter two clusters. There were no genetic signatures of rapid population expansions or bottlenecks. The population from the northern Atlantic Forest was the most genetically divergent group within the species. The demographic history of T. caerulescens was probably affected by series of humid and dry periods throughout the Quaternary that generated subtle population expansions and contractions allowing the intermittent connection of habitats along the circum-Amazonian belt. Recognizing the dynamic history of climate-mediated forest expansions, contractions, and connections during the South American Pleistocene is central toward a mechanistic understanding of circum-Amazonian distributions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Hybridization between two recently diverged Neotropical passerines: The Pearly-bellied Seedeater Sporophila pileata, and the Copper Seedeater S. Bouvreuil (Aves, Passeriformes, Thraupidae)<\/b><br><br>The small Neotropical finches called capuchinos are outstanding because they have experienced one of the most recent and explosive avian radiations ever documented for birds. Despite very low morphological and niche divergence among species, many of them are reproductively isolated when in sympatry due to strong sexual selection in plumage traits. However, a specific pair of mostly parapatric species, the Pearly-bellied, Sporophila pileata, and the Copper Seedeaters, S. bouvreuil, has confounded taxonomists because individuals with intermediate color patterns can be found. By analyzing diagnostic COI mtDNA sequences and adult male plumage we provide evidence for hybridization. Paternity tests using microsatellites also indicated that representatives with intermediate plumage pattern can be fertile. Our findings are consistent with the classification of S. bouvreuil and S. pileata as distinct taxa, but we demonstrate that the sexual selection mechanisms involved in the isolation of other reproductively sympatric capuchinos are not applicable to this pair of species, likely because of reduced barriers to mate recognition. © 2020 Medolago et al.

To the best of our knowledge, comparative evidence of the effect of the different types of exercise on improving HRQOL in cancer patients has not been synthesised thus far. We aim to conduct a systematic review and network meta-analysis in order to synthesise all available evidence regarding the effect of different types of exercise interventions on HRQOL during and after cancer treatment. Methods and analysis MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science, Embase, The Cochrane Library and SPORTDiscus will be searched from inception to December 2018 for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs. Studies assessing physical activity and exercise interventions in cancer patients (during treatment) and survivors (after treatment) will be selected. Two independent reviewers will identify eligible studies. After quality appraisal and data extraction, we will conduct meta-analyses for outcomes of interest, including data from mental and physical dimensions of cancer-specific and/or generic HRQOL questionnaires. Risk of bias assessments will be completed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Study heterogeneity will be measured by the I 2 statistic.

The HBV epidemiology in Latin American countries is complex and the data is still scanty and fragmentary. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of HBV genotypes in Paraguay and to estimate the viral population dynamic and spread pattern of the main phylogenetic group. To this end, partial and complete genome sequences were obtained from 60 blood donor candidates and analysed by phylogenetic and Bayesian phylodynamic approaches. The phylogenetic analysis based on sequences of partial Polymerase/Pre-S1 overlapping region showed a predominance of the Native American subgenotype F4 (81.7%), the presence of the European subgenotypes A2 (1.7%) and D3 (8.3%), the African subgenotype A1 (3, 5%) and the Asian subgenotypes B2 (1.7%) and C2 (1.7%). The distribution of HBV genotypes was in accordance with the ethnic composition of the population. The phylogeographic analysis of subgenotype F4 complete genomes suggests that this lineage emerged and spread in the last 300 years. Paraguay was the most probable location of the common ancestor. The lineage diverged into two main clades and spread to neighbor regions, mainly Bolivia and Northwest Argentina, and Buenos Aires. The phylogeny showed a scanty geographical structure and a complex migratory pattern. In conclusion, the HBV genotypes circulating in Paraguay reflect the ethnic origin of the population. The distribution of genotypes and the phylogeographic reconstruction showed the impact of both global and local migrations in shaping the HBV molecular epidemiology in the region. © 2019","<b>Exercise vs metformin for gestational diabetes mellitus: Protocol for a network meta-analysis<\/b><br><br>INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this protocol is to provide a network meta-analysis methodology that compares the effects of metformin and physical exercise in the prevention and treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and its associated fetal and maternal morbidity. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol conforms to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) and the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. An electronic search will be conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library, from the inception until July 2019. There will be no language restrictions. The Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias (RoB2) and the quality assessment tool for quantitative studies will be used. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation scale will be used to evaluate the strength of the evidence. A Bayesian network meta-analysis will be carried out, which allows direct and indirect comparison of the interventions, for the risk of GDM, prematurity, caesarean section, macrosomia, hypertensive disorders, insulin requirement, and differences in basal glucose, maternal weight, and weight of the newborn. DISCUSSION: With this protocol, a methodology is established that resolves the limitations of previous meta-analysis. It will be possible to determine the difference of effect between physical exercise and metformin in the main outcomes of the GDM, as well as the type and intensity of the exercise, and the dose of metformin, more effective. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The data included in the network meta-analysis will be obtained from trials that meet accepted ethical standards and the Declaration of Helsinki. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The evidence obtained could be included in the guidelines of clinical practice in pregnancy. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: A comprehensive methodology is established for the analysis, through network meta-analysis, of the comparative efficacy of metformin and physical exercise in gestational diabetes mellitus.

Methods and analysis: The literature search will be conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science databases from their inception until July 31, 2019. We will include randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized experimental studies, and controlled pre-post studies assessing the effect in the general population of statins and physical exercise interventions on arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool and the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies will be used to assess the risk of bias for studies included in the systematic review. A Bayesian network meta-analysis will be carried out to determine the comparative effect of the different physical exercise interventions and/or statin intervention. Ethics and dissemination: This study will generate evidence about the effectiveness of both statins and exercise on reducing arterial stiffness that potentially can be transferred to patients and practitioners. Moreover, in light of the importance of reducing arterial stiffness for preventing cardiovascular disease, the evidence provided by this study will be potentially suitable to be included in cardiovascular clinical practice guidelines. Strengths and limitations: This protocol describes the methods of a study examining, using network meta-analysis strategies, the efficacy of statins and different types of exercise on improving arterial stiffness, which is an early marker of atherosclerosis. The results of this study could immediately help clinicians to recommend the best evidence-based intervention to their patients to reduce arterial stiffness and, as a consequence, prevent major complications, such as heart failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction. © 2019 the Author(s).","<b>Distribution, threats and conservation of the white-collared kite (Leptodon forbesi, Accipitridae), the most threatened raptor in the Neotropics<\/b><br><br>The White-collared Kite (Leptodon forbesi) is an endemic and threatened raptor of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Here we present the known records of the species, describe the vegetation types where it was found and show Ecological Niche Models generated using Maxent algorithm. Most of the presence data were recorded in open ombrophilous forest and easonal semideciduous forest in the states of Alagoas and Pernambuco. Maxent model had a good performance (AUC =.982 ± 0.004 SD), showing higher suitability for the species from Paraiba to Alagoas states. Maxent average odel revealed a distribution range of 20,344 km2 and an area of occupancy of 1,636.89 km2. The most suitable areas for the species are those near watercourses and streams. We suggest the creation of protected areas, including private ones, and possible restoration actions to connect the most suitable forest fragments, along with the captive breeding, as the most appropriate strategies for the conservation of the White-collared Kite. © 2019, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

Phylogenetic analyses that included the new form and known species of Oligoryzomys were examined using nucleotide sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian analyses found the new species to be sister to Oligoryzomys longicaudatus and closely related to a clade composed of O. flavescens, O. spB, and O. andinus. Additionally, we analyzed 223 sequences of the mtDNA Control Region belonging to specimens representing the complete geographic distribution of O. longicaudatus, as well as six sequences of the new form, obtaining signals of budding speciation for the insular specimens. Also, we present analyses of morphometric data and descriptions of external, cranial, and dental morphology, along with the karyotype of the new taxon, allowing us to find a unique combination of characters that support the taxonomic identity of this new form and to disentangle the complex taxonomy for the southern Patagonia Oligoryzomys. This new species is relevant to the insular biogeography of the Patagonia given that, for the first time, we propose the glacial cycles of the Pleistocene as generators of a mammal species in southern Patagonia. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","<b>Cryptic Diversity in the Neotropical Gecko Genus Phyllopezus Peters, 1878 (Reptilia: Squamata: Phyllodactylidae): A New Species from Paraguay<\/b><br><br>The gecko genus Phyllopezus is distributed mainly along South America's \"Dry Diagonal\" (Caatinga, Cerrado, and Chaco).

Genetic differentiation among described and putative Phyllopezus species is greater than their morphological differences, which likely accounts for these cryptic taxa remaining undescribed for so long. © 2018 Pier Cacciali et al.","<b>Taxonomic analysis of Paraguayan samples of Homonota fasciata Duméril & Bibron (1836) with the revalidation of Homonota horrida Burmeister (1861) (Reptilia: Squamata: Phyllodactylidae) and the description of a new species<\/b><br><br>Homonota is a Neotropical genus of nocturnal lizards characterized by the following combination of characters: absence of femoral pores, infradigital lamellae not dilated, claws without sheath, inferior lamellae laterally not denticulate, and presence of a ceratobranchial groove. Currently the genus is composed of 10 species assembled in three groups: two groups with four species, and the fasciata group with only two species. Here, we analyzed genetic and morphologic data of samples of Homonota fasciata from Paraguay; according to Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses, the Paraguay population represents an undescribed species. Additionally, morphological analysis of the holotype of H. fasciata (MNHN 6756) shows that it is morphologically different from the banded, large-scaled Homonota commonly referred to as ''H. fasciata''. Given the inconsistency between morphological characters of the name-bearing type of H. fasciata and the species commonly referred to as H. fasciata, we consider them as different taxa. Thus, H. fasciata is a species inquirenda which needs further studies, and we resurrect the name H. horrida for the banded, large-scaled Homonota. The undescribed species from Paraguay is similar to H. horrida, but can be differentiated by the high position of the auditory meatus relative to the mouth commissure (vs. low position in H. horrida); and less developed tubercles on the sides of the head, including a narrow area between the orbit and the auditory meatus covered with small granular scales with or without few tubercles (vs. several big tubercles on the sides of the head even in the area between the orbit and the auditory meatus). The new species is distributed in the Dry Chaco in South America. With the formal description of this species, the actual diversity of the genus Homonota is increased to 12 species. Furthermore, we infer phylogenetic relationships for 11 of the 12 described species of the genus, based on 11 molecular markers (two mitochondrial and nine nuclear genes), with concatenated and species tree approaches. © 2017 Cacciali et al.","<b>Recovering the genetic identity of an extinctin-The-wild species: The puzzling case of the alagoas curassow<\/b><br><br>The conservation of many endangered taxa relies on hybrid identification, and when hybrids become morphologically indistinguishable from the parental species, the use of molecular markers can assign individual admixture levels. Here, we present the puzzling case of the extinct in the wild Alagoas Curassow (Pauxi mitu), whose captive population descends from only three individuals. Hybridization with the Razor-billed Curassow (P. tuberosa) began more than eight generations ago, and admixture uncertainty affects the whole population. We applied an analysis framework that combined morphological diagnostic traits, Bayesian clustering analyses using 14 microsatellite loci, and mtDNA haplotypes to assess the ancestry of all individuals that were alive from 2008 to 2012. Simulated data revealed that our microsatellites could accurately assign an individual a hybrid origin until the second backcross generation, which permitted us to identify a pure group among the older, but still reproductive animals. No wild species has ever survived such a severe bottleneck, followed by hybridization, and studying the recovery capability of the selected pure Alagoas Curassow group might provide valuable insights into biological conservation theory. © 2017 Costa et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, andreproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.","<b>Spinning reserve assessment via quasi-sequential Monte Carlo simulation with renewable sources<\/b><br><br>This paper presents a new methodology for assessing spinning reserve in generating systems with high penetration of renewable energy. A state-space model is proposed to represent the generation capacity failures and the intermittency of renewable sources based on historical scenarios. The uncertainty in the system supply is captured through risk indices that represent the probability of not meeting the short-term estimated demand. A security strategy associated with the probability distribution of reserve levels is also proposed to avoid the over-sizing of reserve capacity levels to handle unlikely extreme operating points. Risk indices are estimated via quasi-sequential MCS-CE (Monte Carlo Simulation via Cross-Entropy) method, where the corresponding parameters are optimally distorted based on CE concepts. The proposed method is applied to a modified version of the IEEE RTS-79 system to cope with renewable sources. © 2016 IEEE.","<b>Recurrent connections between Amazon and Atlantic forests shaped diversity in Caatinga four-eyed frogs<\/b><br><br>Aim: The Caatinga is a widespread but poorly known biome in South America. Its historical stability is controversial and different types of evidence provide support to contrasting hypotheses. We investigate how past biome dynamics may have caused diversification in the endemic four-eyed frog genus Pleurodema. Location: Caatinga biome. Methods: We sampled 353 individuals of Pleurodema alium and Pleurodema diplolister from 60 localities and genotyped them at 12 (P. alium) or 20 (P. diplolister) microsatellite loci. We sequenced a mitochondrial fragment for a subset (199) of the samples. After exploratory analyses to infer genetic structure between and within species, we designed seven biogeographical scenarios based on the literature on species distributions, palaeomodels and geological palaeoindicators. We tested these hypotheses by calculating the posterior probability of models using multilocus approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). Results: Both markers recovered well-defined interspecific limits with restricted introgression, but population structure within P. diplolister is subtle and affected by isolation by distance. Model selection using ABC supported two scenarios of diversification that included recent demographic growth. Genetic breaks at intra- and interspecific levels were geographically coincident, and correlated with past forest invasions reported in the literature. Main conclusions: Our data support the idea that past expansions of the Amazon and Atlantic forests over the current Caatinga distribution shaped the genetic structure in endemic four-eyed frogs at more than one level by promoting intermittent vicariance. Additional support comes from the distribution patterns of forest and Caatinga taxa. Variation among groups suggests differential organismal responses to past habitat shifts, probably mediated by specific natural-history traits. This paper provides the first direct evidence that taxa endemic to the Caatinga were affected by past forest interactions. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","<b>Refined assessment of the geographic distribution of Geoffroy's cat (Leopardus geoffroyi) (Mammalia: Felidae) in the Neotropics<\/b><br><br>Understanding the fine-scale geographic distribution of a species has applications in biogeography, ecology, evolution and conservation. Species distribution models (SDM) have been widely used to predict geographic and climatic ranges of species. Geoffroy's cat Leopardus geoffroyi is a small felid of least concern that occupies a wide variety of habitat types in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. We evaluated the fine-scale distribution of Geoffroy's cat at the sub-continental level, estimated its current extent and area of occurrence and discussed the current and potential ranges developed with SDM. On the basis of species occurrences (n = 1502) and large-scale environmental data, two model types ('environmental' and 'land cover') were developed using MaxEnt. The estimated extent of occurrence of Geoffroy's cat was 3 180 664 km2, but the potential area of occurrence predicted by our environmental model was 70% larger due to areas with high suitability (i.e. >0.5) compared to the species' current range. The most important bioclimatic factors affecting Geoffroy's cat presence were temperature seasonality, mean temperature of the coldest quarter and annual precipitation. Two recent records obtained outside the known distribution of the species fell within the high-suitability area (i.e. >0.5) predicted by our model. Our SDM suggest that this habitat-generalist felid is probably expanding its distribution range by taking advantage of changes in human land use. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London.","<b>Marshes as \"mountain tops\": Genetic analyses of the critically endangered São Paulo Marsh Antwren (Aves: Thamnophilidae)<\/b><br><br>Small populations of endangered species can be impacted by genetic processes such as drift and inbreeding that reduce population viability. As such, conservation genetic analyses that assess population levels of genetic variation and levels of gene flow can provide important information for managing threatened species. The São Paulo Marsh Antwren (Formicivora paludicola) is a recently-described and critically endangered bird from São Paulo State (Brazil) whose total estimated population is around 250-300 individuals, distributed in only 15 isolated marshes around São Paulo metropolitan region. We used microsatellite DNA markers to estimate the population genetic characteristics of the three largest remaining populations of this species all within 60 km of each other. We detected a high and significant genetic structure between all populations (overall FST = 0.103) which is comparable to the highest levels of differentiation ever documented for birds, (e.g., endangered birds found in isolated populations on the tops of African mountains), but also evidence for first-generation immigrants, likely from small local unsampled populations. Effective population sizes were small (between 28.8-99.9 individuals) yet there are high levels of genetic variability within populations and no evidence for inbreeding. Conservation implications of this work are that the high levels of genetic structure suggests that translocations between populations need to be carefully considered in light of possible local adaptation and that remaining populations of these birds should be managed as conservation units that contain both main populations studied here but also small outlying populations which may be a source of immigrants.

Genomic scans aim to identify loci that are diverged with respect to an otherwise weakly differentiated genetic background. These loci are candidates for being past targets of selection because they behave differently from the rest of the genome that has either not yet differentiated or that may cross species barriers through introgressive hybridization. Here we use a reduced-representation genomic approach to explore divergence among six species of southern capuchino seedeaters, a group of recently radiated sympatric passerine birds in the genus Sporophila. For the first time in these taxa, we discovered a small proportion of markers that appeared differentiated among species. However, when assessing the significance of these signatures of divergence, we found that similar patterns can also be recovered from random grouping of individuals representing different species. A detailed demographic inference indicates that genetic differences among Sporophila species could be the consequence of neutral processes, which include a very large ancestral effective population size that accentuates the effects of incomplete lineage sorting. As these neutral phenomena can generate genomic scan patterns that mimic those of markers involved in speciation and phenotypic differentiation, they highlight the need for caution when ascertaining and interpreting differentiated markers between species, especially when large numbers of markers are surveyed. Our study provides new insights into the demography of the southern capuchino radiation and proposes controls to distinguish signal from noise in similar genomic scans. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","<b>Composite reliability evaluation with renewable sources based on quasi-sequential Monte Carlo and cross entropy methods<\/b><br><br>This paper presents a new approach to assess reliability indices in composite generation and transmission systems, considering high penetration of renewable energy. The main idea is to combine a Cross-Entropy (CE)-based optimization approach and quasi-sequential Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to obtain an auxiliary sampling distribution, which can minimize the variance of the reliability index estimators. This auxiliary sampling distribution will properly modify the original unavailabilities of both generation and transmission equipment, so that important failure events are sampled more often. As a result, the MCS algorithm can converge faster and with fewer samples, leading to significant speed-ups, especially when dealing with very reliable system network configurations. The results obtained for the IEEE Reliability Test System - 1996 will be presented and discussed. © 2014 IEEE.","<b>Correlated evolution between mode of larval development and habitat in muricid gastropods<\/b><br><br>Larval modes of development affect evolutionary processes and influence the distribution of marine invertebrates in the ocean. The decrease in pelagic development toward higher latitudes is one of the patterns of distribution most frequently discussed in marine organisms (Thorson's rule), which has been related to increased larval mortality associated with long pelagic durations in colder waters. However, the type of substrate occupied by adults has been suggested to influence the generality of the latitudinal patterns in larval development. To help understand how the environment affects the evolution of larval types we evaluated the association between larval development and habitat using gastropods of the Muricidae family as a model group. To achieve this goal, we collected information on latitudinal distribution, sea water temperature, larval development and type of substrate occupied by adults. We constructed a molecular phylogeny for 45 species of muricids to estimate the ancestral character states and to assess the relationship between traits using comparative methods in a Bayesian framework. Our results showed high probability for a common ancestor of the muricids with nonpelagic (and nonfeeding) development, that lived in hard bottoms and cold temperatures. From this ancestor, a pelagic feeding larva evolved three times, and some species shifted to warmer temperatures or sand bottoms. The evolution of larval development was not independent of habitat; the most probable evolutionary route reconstructed in the analysis of correlated evolution showed that type of larval development may change in soft bottoms but in hard bottoms this change is highly unlikely. Lower sea water temperatures were associated with nonpelagic modes of development, supporting Thorson's rule. We show how environmental pressures can favor a particular mode of larval development or transitions between larval modes and discuss the reacquisition of feeding larva in muricids gastropods. © 2014 Pappalardo et al.","<b>Generating capacity reliability assessment of the Itaipu hydroelectric plant via sequential Monte Carlo simulation<\/b><br><br>The Itaipu Dam is a well-known hydroelectric plant located at the Paraná River, in the border between Brazil and Paraguay. With an installed capacity of 14GW, Itaipu is currently the world's largest electric energy generation plant and the second largest in terms of installed capacity, reaching in 2012 a total generation of 98.3TWh. This work proposes a probabilistic methodology based on sequential Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to assess the generating capacity reliability of Itaipu. The main objective is to estimate reliability indices which can quantify the risks of not having sufficient available generation capacity to meet contractual and/or system demands. All deterministic and stochastic data regarding the Itaipu generating units are directly obtained from their operating history data base. Furthermore, many chronological aspects, such as scheduled maintenance and capacity fluctuation, can be easily included in the simulation model. Finally, by taking advantage of the sequential MCS framework, the proposed method can represent both Markovian and non-Markovian state transitions, obtain monthly indices, and also estimate the annualized reliability indices probability distributions. Case studies are presented and discussed in details. © 2014 Power Systems Computation Conference.","<b>Phylogeny and historical biogeography of gnateaters (Passeriformes, Conopophagidae) in the South America forests<\/b><br><br>We inferred the phylogenetic relationships, divergence time and biogeography of Conopophagidae (gnateaters) based on sequence data of mitochondrial genes (ND2, ND3 and cytb) and nuclear introns (TGFB2 and G3PDH) from 45 tissue samples (43 Conopophaga and 2 Pittasoma) representing all currently recognized species of the family and the majority of subspecies. Phylogenetic relationships were estimated by maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Divergence time estimates were obtained based on a Bayesian relaxed clock model. These chronograms were used to calculate diversification rates and reconstruct ancestral areas of the genus Conopophaga. The phylogenetic analyses support the reciprocal monophyly of the two genera, Conopophaga and Pittasoma. All species were monophyletic with the exception of C. lineata, as C. lineata cearae did not cluster with the other two C. lineata subspecies. Divergence time estimates for Conopophagidae suggested that diversification took place during the Neogene, and that the diversification rate within Conopophaga clade was highest in the late Miocene, followed by a slower diversification rate, suggesting a diversity-dependent pattern. Our analyses of the diversification of family Conopophagidae provided a scenario for evolution in Terra Firme forest across tropical South America. The spatio-temporal pattern suggests that Conopophaga originated in the Brazilian Shield and that a complex sequence of events possibly related to the Andean uplift and infilling of former sedimentation basins and erosion cycles shaped the current distribution and diversity of this genus. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Using phylogenetic information and the comparative method to evaluate hypotheses in macroecology<\/b><br><br>It is widely recognized that macroecological patterns are not independent of the evolution of the lineages involved in generating these patterns. While many researchers have begun to evaluate the effect of ancestor-descendant relationships on observed patterns using the phylogenetic comparative method, most macroecological studies only utilize the cross-sectional comparative method to 'remove the phylogenetic history', without considering the option of evaluating its effect without removing it. Currently, most researchers use this method without explicitly evaluating three fundamental evolutionary assumptions of the comparative method: (i) that the phylogeny is constructed without error (which implies evaluating phylogenetic uncertainty); (ii) that more closely related species tend to show more similar characters than expected by chance (which implies evaluating the phylogenetic signal) and; (iii) that the model of the characters' evolution effectively recapitulates their history (which implies comparing the fit of several evolutionary models and evaluating the uncertainty of the estimating model parameters). Macroecological studies will benefit from the use of the comparative method to assess the effect of phylogenetic history without removing its effect. The comparative method will also allow for the simultaneous analysis of trait evolution and its impact on diversification rates; it is important to evaluate these processes together because they are not independent. In addition, explicit evaluations of the assumptions of comparative methods using Bayesian inferences will allow researchers to quantify the uncertainty of specific evolutionary hypotheses accounting for observed macroecological patterns. We illustrate the usefulness of the method using the phylogeny of the genus Sebastes (Pisces: Scorpaeniformes), together with data on the body size-latitudinal range relationship to estimate the effect of phylogenetic history on the observed macroecological pattern. © 2013 The Authors.

This group is closely related to the Synallaxis moesta complex that occurs in the Andes, Tepuis, and Guianan shield. Here we used mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences to infer the phylogeny and the time of diversification of the S. ruficapilla and S. moesta complexes. We also included samples of an undescribed population of Synallaxis that resembles other populations of the S. ruficapilla complex. Our results showed that different geographical lineages within the S. ruficapilla complex are reciprocally monophyletic, but the northern form (S. infuscata) grouped with an Andean taxon. This suggests that at least two lineages of this group independently colonized the Atlantic Forest. Specimens of the undescribed population formed a monophyletic clade with deep divergence. Estimated diversification dates were within the late Pliocene to Pleistocene (2.75-0.16. million of years ago). This suggests that at this time there was a higher connectivity between habitats in the rugged landscapes of the circum-Amazonian bioregions. The observed Pleistocene diversification within the Atlantic Forest is congruent in space and time with studies of other co-distributed organisms, and may be associated with climate changes and tectonic activity during this period. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Relationships between Panamanians and some creole cattle landraces in Latin America<\/b><br><br>The objective of this work was to establish the genetic relationship between Guabalá and Guaymi cattle populations and some native ones of Latin America. Factorial correspondence analysis, analysis of molecular variance, genetic distances, average number of migrants per population and Wright's F statistics were performed. Population structure was assessed by a Bayesian model, assuming an unknown number of K genetically distinct groups. The correspondence analysis showed that the populations of Guabalá and Guaymí cluster with Mexican creole cattle and Texas Longhorn. Lower genetic differentiation of Panamanian creole with Mexican and Texas Longhorn was also observed. The analyses of genetic distances have also shown similar results to those obtained by Amova and by the factorial correspondence analysis, and the less distance was observed between north populations and Panamanian ones, in comparison with southern populations. Bayesian clustering permitted the assignment of individuals to their respective groups, based on their genetic similarity, and provided information on the number of cluster from which they originate. There is a close historical, genetic, and geographic relationship of Panamanian, Mexican, and Texas Longhorn populations due to the migration of precursors from the Caribbean islands to Panama and Mexico.","<b>Body size evolution in extant Oryzomyini rodents: Cope's rule or miniaturization?<\/b><br><br>At the macroevolutionary level, one of the first and most important hypotheses that proposes an evolutionary tendency in the evolution of body sizes is \"Cope's rule\". This rule has considerable empirical support in the fossil record and predicts that the size of species within a lineage increases over evolutionary time. Nevertheless, there is also a large amount of evidence indicating the opposite pattern of miniaturization over evolutionary time. A recent analysis using a single phylogenetic tree approach and a Bayesian based model of evolution found no evidence for Cope's rule in extant mammal species. Here we utilize a likelihood-based phylogenetic method, to test the evolutionary trend in body size, which considers phylogenetic uncertainty, to discern between Cope's rule and miniaturization, using extant Oryzomyini rodents as a study model. We evaluated body size trends using two principal predictions: (a) phylogenetically related species are more similar in their body size, than expected by chance; (b) body size increased (Cope's rule)/decreased (miniaturization) over time. Consequently the distribution of forces and/or constraints that affect the tendency are homogenous and generate this directional process from a small/large sized ancestor. Results showed that body size in the Oryzomyini tribe evolved according to phylogenetic relationships, with a positive trend, from a small sized ancestor. Our results support that the high diversity and specialization currently observed in the Oryzomyini tribe is a consequence of the evolutionary trend of increased body size, following and supporting Cope's rule. © 2012 Avaria-Llautureo et al.","<b>Reliability assessment of time-dependent systems via sequential cross-entropy Monte Carlo simulation<\/b><br><br>This paper proposes a new methodology to evaluate system generating capacity reliability indices considering time-dependent power sources and loads. Based on sequential Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and the cross-entropy (CE) method, the basic idea is to find an optimal distortion for the equipment transition rates using the CE concepts. A chronological simulation is then carried out using these newly found optimal reference parameters. This process suitably modifies the chronological evolution of the system in order to improve its statistical efficiency and convergence properties. As a result, the computational efforts of the sequential simulation can be greatly reduced while retaining many of its main advantages.

Twelve out of 19 districts in the department were selected and 33 farms with growers in the selected districts were recruited. Questionnaire interviews for each study farm, in combination with faecal sample collections (n = 30 per farm), which were microbiologic ally examined and visual inspection of pig production facilities were performed between March and November 2009. A questionnaire was designed to obtain basic information of a farm such as the number of pigs owned and some selected farming management practices. Faecal samples were used for Salmonella isolation, using buffered peptone water to have salmonellae pre-enriched, followed by xylose lysine tergitol 4 agar and brilliant green sulfapyridine agar. Suspect colonies were bio chemically tested by triple sugar iron agar in combination with lysine iron agar to confirm the identity. The true frequency probability and associated 95% Bayesian credible intervals (95% BCI) were computed via the Gibbs sampler, a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique. Overall, 18% (95% BCI: 8-31%) of the tested 1000 faecal samples were classified as positive for Salmonella enterica. All the study farms had at least one positive sample for Salmonella enterica (frequency range: 3-60%). Apparent prevalence at farm-level was therefore 100% (one-sided 97.5% confidence limit: 89%). Twenty-eight different serovars for Salmonella enterica were found. Based on increase the number of study districts, farms as well as animals in combination with improvement of sampling methods, possible spatial differences and risk factors/indicators should be clarified by further investigations.© 2011 Academic Journals Inc.","<b>Reliability assessment of time-dependent systems via quasi-sequential Monte Carlo simulation<\/b><br><br>This paper proposes a new methodology to assess system reliability considering time-dependent power sources and loads.

The inadequate farm management methods commonly used in backyard chickens make them a potential reservoir for economically important diseases such as infectious bronchitis that can affect commercial poultry operations. There are no earlier studies on a survey of Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) amongst backyard chicken population in Paraguay. The objectives of this study were: (1) to observe the seroprevalence of IBV in backyard chickens in Paraguay and (2) to generate maps for estimated seroprevalence using Bayesian techniques for IBV in the study chickens and for smoothed Relative Risks (RR) drawn by one of the techniques above, in place of using the observed seroprevalence. Paraguay consists of 17 departments. A department-stratified random sampling was designed and implemented. The required total sample size of 1537 from a chicken population of 17 million was adequate to produce a 95% confidence interval with a desired precision of ±2.5% when the estimated seroprevalence was 50%. Sera were analyzed using a commercial indirect ELISA. The overall observed antibody seroprevalence was 80%. The resulting maps for the estimated seroprevalence for IBV using Bayesian techniques in the study chickens at department level, and for the smoothed RRs were illustrated. Different types of epidemiological parameters can be computed to take account of potential risk factors. Therefore, further detailed studies into those risk factors associated with IBV appearance with respect to spatially epidemiological variations would be of interest. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2009.","<b>The use of linear mixed models to estimate optimal vaccination timing for infectious bursal disease in broilers in paraguay<\/b><br><br>The objectives of this study were (1) to fit linear mixed models for Maternally Derived Antibody (MDA) values for estimating optimal days of age for Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD) vaccination in broiler chicks and (2) to evaluate how optimal vaccination timing estimates varied, based on the field data collected in Paraguay. The MDA titres were measured by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) with sera collected from 20 chicks per flock (n = 14) at 1, 8 and 15 days of age. Both Restricted Maximum-likelihood (REML) and Markov Chain-Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation methods were used to fit linear mixed models for the dependent variable log-transformed MDA. There is a slight dissimilarity of each estimate between the two models because of the difference in mathematical algorithms and handling method of missing data. The study flocks with the earliest and latest estimated optimal timing for vaccination had a mean days of age of 15.1 [95% Bayesian Credible Interval (BCI): 13.3-17.0] and 23.7 [95% BCI: 21.7-25.7], respectively. This variation could be partly explained by a limited understanding of the true biological variability representing the variety of factors affecting MDA in the study chicks. Although the results of the study can be used as a benchmark to establish IBD vaccination programmes in the study area, it is recommended for estimating optimal IBD vaccination timing to measure the MDA level by ELISA tests on a routine basis. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2009.","<b>Patterns and processes of diversification in a widespread and ecologically diverse avian group, the buteonine hawks (Aves, Accipitridae)<\/b><br><br>Buteonine hawks represent one of the most diverse groups in the Accipitridae, with 58 species distributed in a variety of habitats on almost all continents. Variations in migratory behavior, remarkable dispersal capability, and unusual diversity in Central and South America make buteonine hawks an excellent model for studies in avian evolution. To evaluate the history of their global radiation, we used an integrative approach that coupled estimation of the phylogeny using a large sequence database (based on 6411 bp of mitochondrial markers and one nuclear intron from 54 species), divergence time estimates, and ancestral state reconstructions. Our findings suggest that Neotropical buteonines resulted from a long evolutionary process that began in the Miocene and extended to the Pleistocene. Colonization of the Nearctic, and eventually the Old World, occurred from South America, promoted by the evolution of seasonal movements and development of land bridges. Migratory behavior evolved several times and may have contributed not only to colonization of the Holarctic, but also derivation of insular species. In the Neotropics, diversification of the buteonines included four disjunction events across the Andes. Adaptation of monophyletic taxa to wet environments occurred more than once, and some relationships indicate an evolutionary connection among mangroves, coastal and várzea environments. On the other hand, groups occupying the same biome, forest, or open vegetation habitats are not monophyletic. Refuges or sea-level changes or a combination of both was responsible for recent speciation in Amazonian taxa. In view of the lack of concordance between phylogeny and classification, we propose numerous taxonomic changes. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We evaluated this hypothesis for South American mole-mice using conventional and Bayesian frameworks, with independent evidence. By using a molecular approach based on Cytochrome b and IRBP sequences, we evaluated phylogenetic relationships, time of origin, the ancestral trait of fossoriality, and ancestral distributions of species belonging to the Andean Clade (Rodentia: Sigmodontinae). Our results indicate that the Andean Clade is highly sustained; with one clade grouping all fossorial forms and another grouping all cursorial species. We hypothesized that fossoriality originated in the Miocene/Pliocene transition, in the Temperate Forests of southern South America. We conclude that the origin of fossorial ecomorphological traits did not necessarily occur under a general model of open environments, the origin of these traits depends on the ecological-historical relationship of the taxon with the environment. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The strategies aim at achieving fair access, fair transmission rate or simultaneous fair access and transmission rate. As a case study, the performance of the considered strategies is evaluated in GSM/EGPRS networks in terms of call blocking probability for voice packet data users and system throughput. However, the analysis is valid for any Radio Transmission Technology that uses LA techniques. For the mathematical analysis, packet data traffic (i.e., IP) is modeled as a process showing pseudo-long range dependence. In particular, to capture their bursty nature, packet data arrivals are considered to follow a Modulated Markov Poisson Process (MMPP) process. Numerical results show that voice calls get lower blocking probability than data packet transmissions when a fair access resource allocation strategy is used. Also, a trade off between (access and/or transmission rate) fairness and system utilization is observed. Finally, it is also shown that high grade of burstiness significantly degrades the system performance. © 2007 IEEE.","<b>Increased taxon and character sampling reveals novel intergeneric relationships in the Cracidae (Aves: Galliformes)<\/b><br><br>The Cracidae is one of the most endangered bird families in the World. Several studies have been published recently on the evolution and conservation of cracids. Phylogenetic analyses using a fragment of 661 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene for 39 different species of cracids corroborated most relationships found in previous studies. The present work attempts to refine the former phylogenetic hypothesis by increasing taxon sampling and combining molecular with osteological, integumentary and behavioural characters using Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Bayesian analyses. We present both separate and combined total evidence analyses with our molecular data, 152 osteological and 74 integumentary + behavioural characters. While supporting most aspects of the molecular-based hypotheses, the tree based on the combined matrix suggests several modifications of the generic composition for each of the two subfamilies: Penelopinae and Cracinae, and supports the merging of the genera Pipile with Aburria and Mitu with Pauxi. These results suggest that increased taxon and character sampling from a diversity of sources may be at least as important as increased sampling of only one type. Besides, of a total of 891 characters we had 437 parsimony-informative sites (almost half of the analyzable sites) proving the efficiency of a total-evidence approach. © 2007 The Authors.","<b>Molecular phylogenetics and biogeography of Neotropical piping guans (Aves: Galliformes): Pipile Bonaparte, 1856 is synonym of Aburria Reichenbach, 1853<\/b><br><br>The Cracidae are Neotropical galliform birds with 11 genera currently recognized. To investigate the questioned validity of Pipile Bonaparte, 1856 and the monotypic Aburria Reichenbach, 1853 as separate genera, we gathered data from 2727 bp of mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome b, ND2 and control region) and 151 osteological characters. Our phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences indicated that Aburria aburri is embedded within Pipile. Also, genetic distances between Aburria and any Pipile species are equivalent to the distances estimated for other congeneric cracid species, which genus status is not doubtful. Although the osteological characters do not have phylogenetic signal to solve the phylogenetic relationships at species level, five synapomorphies were found for Aburria and Pipile. Therefore, we suggest that Pipile should be merged with Aburria, which is the oldest described genus. We estimated that speciation in this group occurred in the Plio-Pleistocene, concordant with other birds, primates and rodents that have similar geographic distribution, and proposed a diversification hypothesis based on the occurrence of sea transgressions and the formation of the Amazon Lagoon. Therefore, we conclude that these palaeogeographic events may have contributed to Neotropical taxa diversification to a greater extent than previously suspected. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

However, there is still no consensus on the causes of their demise. Here, we use the fossil record and Bayesian diversification models to infer the origination and extinction rates for Sparassodonta. Then, we evaluate if their demise can be attributed to global temperature changes, Andean uplift, biotic interactions with their competitor and prey clades, and body mass evolution. That is biotic aspects in the context of the Red Queen model, abiotic aspects in the context of the Court Jester model, and an intrinsic lineage attribute. Our results show that this lineage is characterized by a positive near-zero net diversification rate indicating that the clade maintained a relatively low but stable diversity until the Middle Miocene when an increase in extinction rate drove them to decline and eventual extinction. Moreover, our results support the idea that a drastic regional landscape change triggered by the Andean uplift process affected their diversification dynamics, eventually driving them to extinction. These environmental changes could explicitly affect Sparassodonta lineages due to their ever-present vulnerability to extinction by near-zero net diversification rate and their highly specialized ecology that could have constrained adaptation to new South American landscapes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Species have been lost at unprecedented rates. Because only a small fraction of the threatened taxa have been managed under human care, contrasting the characteristics of taxa that have, and have not been targeted to ex situ conservation can reveal the reach of this conservation strategy, and can indicate its main challenges. Here we investigated whether the level of threat, diet, body mass, phylogeny, and previous presence in captivity due to non-conservation purposes could be potential parameters accounting for the occurrence of Brazilian threatened avian species and subspecies in ex situ conservation facilities and for their eligibility to organized ex situ conservation plans. Using Bayesian phylogenetic comparative models we found positive effects of body mass and phylogeny, and a negative effect of insectivorous diet in the occurrence of the taxa in non-conservation facilities. The previous presence in non-conservation facilities, together with phylogeny, diet, and body mass were the main parameters accounting for the occurrence of the threatened taxa in ex situ conservation facilities, and the previous presence in non-conservation facilities and phylogeny explained the existence of organized ex situ conservation plans. This is evidence that conservation breeding facilities have mostly harbored threatened confiscated birds than choosing them based on scientific criteria. We suggest that investing in the development of husbandry techniques, especially for insectivorous passerines, and choosing taxa based on scientific criteria are important challenges that should be on the agenda of conservation managers. © 2022 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação","Forecasting the dynamics of the number of cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a given population is a challenging task due to behavioural changes which occur over short periods. Planning of hospital resources and containment measures in the near term require a scenario analysis and the use of predictive models to gain insight into possible outcomes for each scenario. In this paper, we present the SEIR-H epidemiological model for the spread dynamics in a given population and the impact of COVID-19 in the local health system. It was developed as an extension of the classic SEIR model to account for required hospital resources and behavioural changes of the population in response to containment measures. Time-varying parameters such as transmissibility are estimated using Bayesian methods, based on the database of reported cases with a moving time-window strategy. The assessment of the model offers reasonable results with estimated parameters and simulations, reflecting the observed dynamics in Paraguay. The proposed model can be used to simulate future scenarios and possible effects of containment strategies, to guide the public institution response based on the available resources in the local health system. © 2021 by the authors.

In this work, we propose a Bayesian optimization system dedicated to monitoring and estimating multiple water quality parameters simultaneously using a single autonomous surface vehicle. The proposed work combines different strategies and methods for this monitoring task, evaluating two approaches for acquisition function fusion: the coupled and the decoupled techniques. We also consider dynamic parametrization of the maximum measurement distance traveled by the ASV so that the monitoring system balances the total number of measurements and the total distance, which is related to the energy required. To evaluate the proposed approach, the Ypacarai Lake (Paraguay) serves as the test scenario, where multiple maps of water quality parameters, such as pH and dissolved oxygen, need to be obtained efficiently. The proposed system is compared with the predictive entropy search for multi-objective optimization with constraints (PESMOC) algorithm and the genetic algorithm (GA) path planning for the Ypacarai Lake scenario. The obtained results show that the proposed approach is 10.82% better than other optimization methods in terms of R2 score with noiseless measurements and up to 17.23% better when the data are noisy. Additionally, the proposed approach achieves a good average computational time for the whole mission when compared with other methods, 3% better than the GA technique and 46.5% better than the PESMOC approach. © 2021 by the authors.

From June to September 2017, coalescent sunken necrotic lesions were observed on the banana fruit cv. Tabasco (Musa acuminata), harvested in two orchards in Teapa, Tabasco, southeast of Mexico. Thus, this research aimed to identify the causal agents of necrotic lesions that affect banana production. Isolates of Colletotrichum spp. obtained from the sunken necrotic lesions were studied by morphological and multilocus phylogenetic approaches. Amplification and sequencing of the six (GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT, TUB, GS, and APMAT) partial genes were performed. Later, individual alignment for each gene was created and concatenated. Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses revealed that the three representative strains belong to C. chrysophilum, a member of C. gloeosporioides species complex. To determine whether C. chrysophilum strains were responsible for the symptoms on banana fruit, a pathogenicity test was conducted by inoculation of wounded fruit. Typical necrotic lesions were observed 8 days after inoculation, while the control fruit remained healthy. This finding represents the first report of C. chrysophilum causing anthracnose of banana in Mexico; therefore, it should be considered an integrated management program to reduce losses caused by this disease. © 2020, Deutsche Phytomedizinische Gesellschaft.","Studying the risk of contamination is essential for the protection of aquifers. In Paraguay, one of the major drinking water supplies is the Patiño Aquifer. A previous study, using a deterministic model, identified that 42% of the aquifer have a high risk of contamination. This work uses artificial intelligence (AI) models, with regression and classification approaches, to estimate the contamination risk of the urban zone of the Patiño aquifer by Total Nitrogen (TN). The Supervised Committee Machine with Artificial Intelligence (SCMAI) model is applied as a regression model, which combines the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Mamdani Fuzzy Logic (MFL), Sugeno Fuzzy Logic (SFL) and Neuro Fuzzy (NF) models. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the correlation of estimated risk with TN concentration are used for the evaluation. The Decision Trees (DT), Bayesian Network (BN) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models are used for the low and not low risk classification approach. These models were evaluated based on the precision, recall and accuracy indicators. The SCMAI model improved the performance and correlation of the ANN, MFL and SFL models, with RMSE, MAE and correlation values of 2.33, 1.38 and 0.86 respectively. The J48 and PART algorithms, applied to the DT model, and the KNN model obtained an accuracy of 99%, and the BN model obtained an accuracy of 98%. Precision and recall values showed that the DT algorithms failed less, by 10%, and that it is able to identify 81% of the cases of the not low risk levels. It was observed that both approaches give a competent picture of the state of the Patiño aquifer in relation to the risk of contamination. © 20th International Conferences on WWW/Internet 2021 and Applied Computing 2021.","Bayesian Optimization is a sequential method for obtaining the maximum of an unknown function that has gained much popularity in recent years. Bayesian Optimization is commonly used to monitor the surface of large-scale aquatic environments using an Autonomous Surface Vehicle. We propose to model water quality parameters using Gaussian Processes, and propose three different adaptations of classical Acquisition Functions in order to explore an unknown space, considering surface vehicle restrictions. The proposed Sequential Bayesian Optimization system uses the aforementioned information in order to monitor the Lake and also to obtain a water quality model, which has an associated uncertainty map. For evaluation, the Mean Squared Error of the resulting approximated models are compared. Afterwards, they are compared with other monitoring algorithms, like the Traveling Salesman Problem, using Genetic Algorithms and Lawnmower. Concluding remarks indicate that the proposed method not only performs better while minimizing the Mean Squared Error (via active monitoring), but also manages to quickly identify an approximate of the black-box function, which is very useful for monitoring lakes like Ypacarai Lake ( 60\\: km^{2} ) in Paraguay. Additionally, the proposed method reduces the MSE by 25% when compared with Traveling Salesman Problem-based monitoring algorithms and also provides a more robust solution, i.e., 30% more independent of initial conditions, when compared with known robust coverage methods like the lawnmower method. © 2013 IEEE.","It is well known that body size variation can be related to genetic and environmental factors and that this variation may occur among species, and among and within populations. Scinax fuscomarginatus is a widely distributed Neotropical anuran that occurs in open areas of several South American ecoregions, exposed to different climatic conditions and showing high levels of body size variation. We tested if this variation in body size is related to phylogeny or to any climatic condition to which populations are subjected. We measured the snout-vent length (SVL) of 285 individuals of S. fuscomarginatus from 37 populations, covering virtually all the known geographic distribution of the species. We constructed a phylogenetic tree under Bayesian inference based on mtDNA sequences to test for the existence of phylogenetic signal in body size variation and performed a multiple linear regression to examine the relationship between body size and environmental variables. Although S. fuscomarginatus shows a deep genetic structure, body size variation was randomly distributed across the phylogeny, indicating no phylogenetic signal. On the other hand, we found evidence that support some influence of climatic conditions in body size variation, being the precipitation seasonality and the temperature seasonality the most important variables. Our results are in accordance with the water conservation hypothesis, which predicts an increase in body size towards drier regions assuming that lower surface-to-volume ratio of larger bodies minimizes water loss by evaporation. © 2020 The Zoological Society of London","The Neotropics show a wealth of distributional patterns shared by many co-distributed species. A distinctive pattern is the so-called “circum-Amazonian distribution,” which is observed in species that do not occur in Amazonia but rather along a belt of forested habitats spanning south and east of Amazonia, the Andean foothills, and often into the Venezuelan Coastal Range and the Tepuis. Although this pattern is widespread across animals and plants, its underlying biogeographic mechanisms remain poorly understood. The Variable Antshrike (Thamnophilus caerulescens) is a sexually dimorphic suboscine passerine that exhibits extreme plumage variation and occurs along the southern portion of the circum-Amazonian belt. We describe broad-scale phylogeographic patterns of T. caerulescens and assess its demographic history using DNA sequences from the mitochondrion and ultraconserved elements (UCEs). We identified three genomic clusters: a) northern Atlantic Forest; b) southeastern Cerrado and central-southern Atlantic Forest, and c) Chaco and Andes. Our results were consistent with Pleistocene divergence followed by gene flow, mainly between the latter two clusters. There were no genetic signatures of rapid population expansions or bottlenecks. The population from the northern Atlantic Forest was the most genetically divergent group within the species. The demographic history of T. caerulescens was probably affected by series of humid and dry periods throughout the Quaternary that generated subtle population expansions and contractions allowing the intermittent connection of habitats along the circum-Amazonian belt. Recognizing the dynamic history of climate-mediated forest expansions, contractions, and connections during the South American Pleistocene is central toward a mechanistic understanding of circum-Amazonian distributions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","The small Neotropical finches called capuchinos are outstanding because they have experienced one of the most recent and explosive avian radiations ever documented for birds. Despite very low morphological and niche divergence among species, many of them are reproductively isolated when in sympatry due to strong sexual selection in plumage traits. However, a specific pair of mostly parapatric species, the Pearly-bellied, Sporophila pileata, and the Copper Seedeaters, S. bouvreuil, has confounded taxonomists because individuals with intermediate color patterns can be found. By analyzing diagnostic COI mtDNA sequences and adult male plumage we provide evidence for hybridization. Paternity tests using microsatellites also indicated that representatives with intermediate plumage pattern can be fertile. Our findings are consistent with the classification of S. bouvreuil and S. pileata as distinct taxa, but we demonstrate that the sexual selection mechanisms involved in the isolation of other reproductively sympatric capuchinos are not applicable to this pair of species, likely because of reduced barriers to mate recognition. © 2020 Medolago et al.

Strategies as physical activity and exercise during and after cancer may improve health-related qualify of life (HRQOL) outcomes and are, therefore, of clinical and public health importance. To the best of our knowledge, comparative evidence of the effect of the different types of exercise on improving HRQOL in cancer patients has not been synthesised thus far. We aim to conduct a systematic review and network meta-analysis in order to synthesise all available evidence regarding the effect of different types of exercise interventions on HRQOL during and after cancer treatment. Methods and analysis MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science, Embase, The Cochrane Library and SPORTDiscus will be searched from inception to December 2018 for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs. Studies assessing physical activity and exercise interventions in cancer patients (during treatment) and survivors (after treatment) will be selected. Two independent reviewers will identify eligible studies. After quality appraisal and data extraction, we will conduct meta-analyses for outcomes of interest, including data from mental and physical dimensions of cancer-specific and/or generic HRQOL questionnaires. Risk of bias assessments will be completed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Study heterogeneity will be measured by the I 2 statistic. Bayesian (and traditional approach) network meta-analysis will be performed when possible to determine the comparative effect of the different physical activity or exercise interventions. Ethics and dissemination This systematic review and network meta-analysis will synthesise evidence on the effect of different types of exercise interventions on HRQOL during and after cancer treatment. The results will be disseminated by publication in a peer-reviewed journal and through scientific conferences and symposia. Ethical approval will not be required because the data used for this work will be exclusively extracted from published studies.

The HBV epidemiology in Latin American countries is complex and the data is still scanty and fragmentary. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of HBV genotypes in Paraguay and to estimate the viral population dynamic and spread pattern of the main phylogenetic group. To this end, partial and complete genome sequences were obtained from 60 blood donor candidates and analysed by phylogenetic and Bayesian phylodynamic approaches. The phylogenetic analysis based on sequences of partial Polymerase/Pre-S1 overlapping region showed a predominance of the Native American subgenotype F4 (81.7%), the presence of the European subgenotypes A2 (1.7%) and D3 (8.3%), the African subgenotype A1 (3, 5%) and the Asian subgenotypes B2 (1.7%) and C2 (1.7%). The distribution of HBV genotypes was in accordance with the ethnic composition of the population. The phylogeographic analysis of subgenotype F4 complete genomes suggests that this lineage emerged and spread in the last 300 years. Paraguay was the most probable location of the common ancestor. The lineage diverged into two main clades and spread to neighbor regions, mainly Bolivia and Northwest Argentina, and Buenos Aires. The phylogeny showed a scanty geographical structure and a complex migratory pattern. In conclusion, the HBV genotypes circulating in Paraguay reflect the ethnic origin of the population. The distribution of genotypes and the phylogeographic reconstruction showed the impact of both global and local migrations in shaping the HBV molecular epidemiology in the region. © 2019","INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this protocol is to provide a network meta-analysis methodology that compares the effects of metformin and physical exercise in the prevention and treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and its associated fetal and maternal morbidity. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol conforms to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) and the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. An electronic search will be conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library, from the inception until July 2019. There will be no language restrictions. The Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias (RoB2) and the quality assessment tool for quantitative studies will be used. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation scale will be used to evaluate the strength of the evidence. A Bayesian network meta-analysis will be carried out, which allows direct and indirect comparison of the interventions, for the risk of GDM, prematurity, caesarean section, macrosomia, hypertensive disorders, insulin requirement, and differences in basal glucose, maternal weight, and weight of the newborn. DISCUSSION: With this protocol, a methodology is established that resolves the limitations of previous meta-analysis. It will be possible to determine the difference of effect between physical exercise and metformin in the main outcomes of the GDM, as well as the type and intensity of the exercise, and the dose of metformin, more effective. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The data included in the network meta-analysis will be obtained from trials that meet accepted ethical standards and the Declaration of Helsinki. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The evidence obtained could be included in the guidelines of clinical practice in pregnancy. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: A comprehensive methodology is established for the analysis, through network meta-analysis, of the comparative efficacy of metformin and physical exercise in gestational diabetes mellitus. The results obtained could help medical professionals by establishing the best evidence-based interventions which may be recommended for these population groups.

Methods and analysis: The literature search will be conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science databases from their inception until July 31, 2019. We will include randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized experimental studies, and controlled pre-post studies assessing the effect in the general population of statins and physical exercise interventions on arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool and the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies will be used to assess the risk of bias for studies included in the systematic review. A Bayesian network meta-analysis will be carried out to determine the comparative effect of the different physical exercise interventions and/or statin intervention. Ethics and dissemination: This study will generate evidence about the effectiveness of both statins and exercise on reducing arterial stiffness that potentially can be transferred to patients and practitioners. Moreover, in light of the importance of reducing arterial stiffness for preventing cardiovascular disease, the evidence provided by this study will be potentially suitable to be included in cardiovascular clinical practice guidelines. Strengths and limitations: This protocol describes the methods of a study examining, using network meta-analysis strategies, the efficacy of statins and different types of exercise on improving arterial stiffness, which is an early marker of atherosclerosis. The results of this study could immediately help clinicians to recommend the best evidence-based intervention to their patients to reduce arterial stiffness and, as a consequence, prevent major complications, such as heart failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction. © 2019 the Author(s).","The White-collared Kite (Leptodon forbesi) is an endemic and threatened raptor of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Here we present the known records of the species, describe the vegetation types where it was found and show Ecological Niche Models generated using Maxent algorithm. Most of the presence data were recorded in open ombrophilous forest and easonal semideciduous forest in the states of Alagoas and Pernambuco. Maxent model had a good performance (AUC =.982 ± 0.004 SD), showing higher suitability for the species from Paraiba to Alagoas states. Maxent average odel revealed a distribution range of 20,344 km2 and an area of occupancy of 1,636.89 km2. The most suitable areas for the species are those near watercourses and streams. We suggest the creation of protected areas, including private ones, and possible restoration actions to connect the most suitable forest fragments, along with the captive breeding, as the most appropriate strategies for the conservation of the White-collared Kite. © 2019, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

Phylogenetic analyses that included the new form and known species of Oligoryzomys were examined using nucleotide sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian analyses found the new species to be sister to Oligoryzomys longicaudatus and closely related to a clade composed of O. flavescens, O. spB, and O. andinus. Additionally, we analyzed 223 sequences of the mtDNA Control Region belonging to specimens representing the complete geographic distribution of O. longicaudatus, as well as six sequences of the new form, obtaining signals of budding speciation for the insular specimens. Also, we present analyses of morphometric data and descriptions of external, cranial, and dental morphology, along with the karyotype of the new taxon, allowing us to find a unique combination of characters that support the taxonomic identity of this new form and to disentangle the complex taxonomy for the southern Patagonia Oligoryzomys. This new species is relevant to the insular biogeography of the Patagonia given that, for the first time, we propose the glacial cycles of the Pleistocene as generators of a mammal species in southern Patagonia. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","The gecko genus Phyllopezus is distributed mainly along South America's \"Dry Diagonal\" (Caatinga, Cerrado, and Chaco). The genus has been the subject of recent taxonomic analyses and includes four described species and seven candidate species referred to here as Phyllopezus pollicaris sensu lato. In Paraguay, Phyllopezus is known from the Chaco and Cerrado where it is abundant, and also from a small isolated population from a rocky hill formation named \"Cordillera de Los Altos\" (Los Altos mountain range). Here we analyzed genetic samples from across its range, including new samples from Paraguay, using DNA barcoding analysis of the mitochondrial 16S gene and phylogenetic analyses using both Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods. We found genetic and morphological differences among geckos from the Los Altos mountain range and the remaining Phyllopezus populations. Using both molecular and morphological evidence we describe a new Phyllopezus species, sister to P. przewalskii. Genetic differentiation among described and putative Phyllopezus species is greater than their morphological differences, which likely accounts for these cryptic taxa remaining undescribed for so long. © 2018 Pier Cacciali et al.","Homonota is a Neotropical genus of nocturnal lizards characterized by the following combination of characters: absence of femoral pores, infradigital lamellae not dilated, claws without sheath, inferior lamellae laterally not denticulate, and presence of a ceratobranchial groove. Currently the genus is composed of 10 species assembled in three groups: two groups with four species, and the fasciata group with only two species. Here, we analyzed genetic and morphologic data of samples of Homonota fasciata from Paraguay; according to Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses, the Paraguay population represents an undescribed species. Additionally, morphological analysis of the holotype of H. fasciata (MNHN 6756) shows that it is morphologically different from the banded, large-scaled Homonota commonly referred to as ''H. fasciata''. Given the inconsistency between morphological characters of the name-bearing type of H. fasciata and the species commonly referred to as H. fasciata, we consider them as different taxa. Thus, H. fasciata is a species inquirenda which needs further studies, and we resurrect the name H. horrida for the banded, large-scaled Homonota. The undescribed species from Paraguay is similar to H. horrida, but can be differentiated by the high position of the auditory meatus relative to the mouth commissure (vs. low position in H. horrida); and less developed tubercles on the sides of the head, including a narrow area between the orbit and the auditory meatus covered with small granular scales with or without few tubercles (vs. several big tubercles on the sides of the head even in the area between the orbit and the auditory meatus). The new species is distributed in the Dry Chaco in South America. With the formal description of this species, the actual diversity of the genus Homonota is increased to 12 species. Furthermore, we infer phylogenetic relationships for 11 of the 12 described species of the genus, based on 11 molecular markers (two mitochondrial and nine nuclear genes), with concatenated and species tree approaches. © 2017 Cacciali et al.","The conservation of many endangered taxa relies on hybrid identification, and when hybrids become morphologically indistinguishable from the parental species, the use of molecular markers can assign individual admixture levels. Here, we present the puzzling case of the extinct in the wild Alagoas Curassow (Pauxi mitu), whose captive population descends from only three individuals. Hybridization with the Razor-billed Curassow (P. tuberosa) began more than eight generations ago, and admixture uncertainty affects the whole population. We applied an analysis framework that combined morphological diagnostic traits, Bayesian clustering analyses using 14 microsatellite loci, and mtDNA haplotypes to assess the ancestry of all individuals that were alive from 2008 to 2012. Simulated data revealed that our microsatellites could accurately assign an individual a hybrid origin until the second backcross generation, which permitted us to identify a pure group among the older, but still reproductive animals. No wild species has ever survived such a severe bottleneck, followed by hybridization, and studying the recovery capability of the selected pure Alagoas Curassow group might provide valuable insights into biological conservation theory. © 2017 Costa et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, andreproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.","This paper presents a new methodology for assessing spinning reserve in generating systems with high penetration of renewable energy. A state-space model is proposed to represent the generation capacity failures and the intermittency of renewable sources based on historical scenarios. The uncertainty in the system supply is captured through risk indices that represent the probability of not meeting the short-term estimated demand. A security strategy associated with the probability distribution of reserve levels is also proposed to avoid the over-sizing of reserve capacity levels to handle unlikely extreme operating points. Risk indices are estimated via quasi-sequential MCS-CE (Monte Carlo Simulation via Cross-Entropy) method, where the corresponding parameters are optimally distorted based on CE concepts. The proposed method is applied to a modified version of the IEEE RTS-79 system to cope with renewable sources. © 2016 IEEE.","Aim: The Caatinga is a widespread but poorly known biome in South America. Its historical stability is controversial and different types of evidence provide support to contrasting hypotheses. We investigate how past biome dynamics may have caused diversification in the endemic four-eyed frog genus Pleurodema. Location: Caatinga biome. Methods: We sampled 353 individuals of Pleurodema alium and Pleurodema diplolister from 60 localities and genotyped them at 12 (P. alium) or 20 (P. diplolister) microsatellite loci. We sequenced a mitochondrial fragment for a subset (199) of the samples. After exploratory analyses to infer genetic structure between and within species, we designed seven biogeographical scenarios based on the literature on species distributions, palaeomodels and geological palaeoindicators. We tested these hypotheses by calculating the posterior probability of models using multilocus approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). Results: Both markers recovered well-defined interspecific limits with restricted introgression, but population structure within P. diplolister is subtle and affected by isolation by distance. Model selection using ABC supported two scenarios of diversification that included recent demographic growth. Genetic breaks at intra- and interspecific levels were geographically coincident, and correlated with past forest invasions reported in the literature. Main conclusions: Our data support the idea that past expansions of the Amazon and Atlantic forests over the current Caatinga distribution shaped the genetic structure in endemic four-eyed frogs at more than one level by promoting intermittent vicariance. Additional support comes from the distribution patterns of forest and Caatinga taxa. Variation among groups suggests differential organismal responses to past habitat shifts, probably mediated by specific natural-history traits. This paper provides the first direct evidence that taxa endemic to the Caatinga were affected by past forest interactions. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Understanding the fine-scale geographic distribution of a species has applications in biogeography, ecology, evolution and conservation. Species distribution models (SDM) have been widely used to predict geographic and climatic ranges of species. Geoffroy's cat Leopardus geoffroyi is a small felid of least concern that occupies a wide variety of habitat types in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. We evaluated the fine-scale distribution of Geoffroy's cat at the sub-continental level, estimated its current extent and area of occurrence and discussed the current and potential ranges developed with SDM. On the basis of species occurrences (n = 1502) and large-scale environmental data, two model types ('environmental' and 'land cover') were developed using MaxEnt. The estimated extent of occurrence of Geoffroy's cat was 3 180 664 km2, but the potential area of occurrence predicted by our environmental model was 70% larger due to areas with high suitability (i.e. >0.5) compared to the species' current range. The most important bioclimatic factors affecting Geoffroy's cat presence were temperature seasonality, mean temperature of the coldest quarter and annual precipitation. Two recent records obtained outside the known distribution of the species fell within the high-suitability area (i.e. >0.5) predicted by our model. Our SDM suggest that this habitat-generalist felid is probably expanding its distribution range by taking advantage of changes in human land use. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London.","Small populations of endangered species can be impacted by genetic processes such as drift and inbreeding that reduce population viability. As such, conservation genetic analyses that assess population levels of genetic variation and levels of gene flow can provide important information for managing threatened species. The São Paulo Marsh Antwren (Formicivora paludicola) is a recently-described and critically endangered bird from São Paulo State (Brazil) whose total estimated population is around 250-300 individuals, distributed in only 15 isolated marshes around São Paulo metropolitan region. We used microsatellite DNA markers to estimate the population genetic characteristics of the three largest remaining populations of this species all within 60 km of each other. We detected a high and significant genetic structure between all populations (overall FST = 0.103) which is comparable to the highest levels of differentiation ever documented for birds, (e.g., endangered birds found in isolated populations on the tops of African mountains), but also evidence for first-generation immigrants, likely from small local unsampled populations. Effective population sizes were small (between 28.8-99.9 individuals) yet there are high levels of genetic variability within populations and no evidence for inbreeding. Conservation implications of this work are that the high levels of genetic structure suggests that translocations between populations need to be carefully considered in light of possible local adaptation and that remaining populations of these birds should be managed as conservation units that contain both main populations studied here but also small outlying populations which may be a source of immigrants.

Genomic scans aim to identify loci that are diverged with respect to an otherwise weakly differentiated genetic background. These loci are candidates for being past targets of selection because they behave differently from the rest of the genome that has either not yet differentiated or that may cross species barriers through introgressive hybridization. Here we use a reduced-representation genomic approach to explore divergence among six species of southern capuchino seedeaters, a group of recently radiated sympatric passerine birds in the genus Sporophila. For the first time in these taxa, we discovered a small proportion of markers that appeared differentiated among species. However, when assessing the significance of these signatures of divergence, we found that similar patterns can also be recovered from random grouping of individuals representing different species. A detailed demographic inference indicates that genetic differences among Sporophila species could be the consequence of neutral processes, which include a very large ancestral effective population size that accentuates the effects of incomplete lineage sorting. As these neutral phenomena can generate genomic scan patterns that mimic those of markers involved in speciation and phenotypic differentiation, they highlight the need for caution when ascertaining and interpreting differentiated markers between species, especially when large numbers of markers are surveyed. Our study provides new insights into the demography of the southern capuchino radiation and proposes controls to distinguish signal from noise in similar genomic scans. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","This paper presents a new approach to assess reliability indices in composite generation and transmission systems, considering high penetration of renewable energy. The main idea is to combine a Cross-Entropy (CE)-based optimization approach and quasi-sequential Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to obtain an auxiliary sampling distribution, which can minimize the variance of the reliability index estimators. This auxiliary sampling distribution will properly modify the original unavailabilities of both generation and transmission equipment, so that important failure events are sampled more often. As a result, the MCS algorithm can converge faster and with fewer samples, leading to significant speed-ups, especially when dealing with very reliable system network configurations. The results obtained for the IEEE Reliability Test System - 1996 will be presented and discussed. © 2014 IEEE.","Larval modes of development affect evolutionary processes and influence the distribution of marine invertebrates in the ocean. The decrease in pelagic development toward higher latitudes is one of the patterns of distribution most frequently discussed in marine organisms (Thorson's rule), which has been related to increased larval mortality associated with long pelagic durations in colder waters. However, the type of substrate occupied by adults has been suggested to influence the generality of the latitudinal patterns in larval development. To help understand how the environment affects the evolution of larval types we evaluated the association between larval development and habitat using gastropods of the Muricidae family as a model group. To achieve this goal, we collected information on latitudinal distribution, sea water temperature, larval development and type of substrate occupied by adults. We constructed a molecular phylogeny for 45 species of muricids to estimate the ancestral character states and to assess the relationship between traits using comparative methods in a Bayesian framework. Our results showed high probability for a common ancestor of the muricids with nonpelagic (and nonfeeding) development, that lived in hard bottoms and cold temperatures. From this ancestor, a pelagic feeding larva evolved three times, and some species shifted to warmer temperatures or sand bottoms. The evolution of larval development was not independent of habitat; the most probable evolutionary route reconstructed in the analysis of correlated evolution showed that type of larval development may change in soft bottoms but in hard bottoms this change is highly unlikely. Lower sea water temperatures were associated with nonpelagic modes of development, supporting Thorson's rule. We show how environmental pressures can favor a particular mode of larval development or transitions between larval modes and discuss the reacquisition of feeding larva in muricids gastropods. © 2014 Pappalardo et al.","The Itaipu Dam is a well-known hydroelectric plant located at the Paraná River, in the border between Brazil and Paraguay. With an installed capacity of 14GW, Itaipu is currently the world's largest electric energy generation plant and the second largest in terms of installed capacity, reaching in 2012 a total generation of 98.3TWh. This work proposes a probabilistic methodology based on sequential Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to assess the generating capacity reliability of Itaipu. The main objective is to estimate reliability indices which can quantify the risks of not having sufficient available generation capacity to meet contractual and/or system demands. All deterministic and stochastic data regarding the Itaipu generating units are directly obtained from their operating history data base. Furthermore, many chronological aspects, such as scheduled maintenance and capacity fluctuation, can be easily included in the simulation model. Finally, by taking advantage of the sequential MCS framework, the proposed method can represent both Markovian and non-Markovian state transitions, obtain monthly indices, and also estimate the annualized reliability indices probability distributions. Case studies are presented and discussed in details. © 2014 Power Systems Computation Conference.","We inferred the phylogenetic relationships, divergence time and biogeography of Conopophagidae (gnateaters) based on sequence data of mitochondrial genes (ND2, ND3 and cytb) and nuclear introns (TGFB2 and G3PDH) from 45 tissue samples (43 Conopophaga and 2 Pittasoma) representing all currently recognized species of the family and the majority of subspecies. Phylogenetic relationships were estimated by maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Divergence time estimates were obtained based on a Bayesian relaxed clock model. These chronograms were used to calculate diversification rates and reconstruct ancestral areas of the genus Conopophaga. The phylogenetic analyses support the reciprocal monophyly of the two genera, Conopophaga and Pittasoma. All species were monophyletic with the exception of C. lineata, as C. lineata cearae did not cluster with the other two C. lineata subspecies. Divergence time estimates for Conopophagidae suggested that diversification took place during the Neogene, and that the diversification rate within Conopophaga clade was highest in the late Miocene, followed by a slower diversification rate, suggesting a diversity-dependent pattern. Our analyses of the diversification of family Conopophagidae provided a scenario for evolution in Terra Firme forest across tropical South America. The spatio-temporal pattern suggests that Conopophaga originated in the Brazilian Shield and that a complex sequence of events possibly related to the Andean uplift and infilling of former sedimentation basins and erosion cycles shaped the current distribution and diversity of this genus. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","It is widely recognized that macroecological patterns are not independent of the evolution of the lineages involved in generating these patterns. While many researchers have begun to evaluate the effect of ancestor-descendant relationships on observed patterns using the phylogenetic comparative method, most macroecological studies only utilize the cross-sectional comparative method to 'remove the phylogenetic history', without considering the option of evaluating its effect without removing it. Currently, most researchers use this method without explicitly evaluating three fundamental evolutionary assumptions of the comparative method: (i) that the phylogeny is constructed without error (which implies evaluating phylogenetic uncertainty); (ii) that more closely related species tend to show more similar characters than expected by chance (which implies evaluating the phylogenetic signal) and; (iii) that the model of the characters' evolution effectively recapitulates their history (which implies comparing the fit of several evolutionary models and evaluating the uncertainty of the estimating model parameters). Macroecological studies will benefit from the use of the comparative method to assess the effect of phylogenetic history without removing its effect. The comparative method will also allow for the simultaneous analysis of trait evolution and its impact on diversification rates; it is important to evaluate these processes together because they are not independent. In addition, explicit evaluations of the assumptions of comparative methods using Bayesian inferences will allow researchers to quantify the uncertainty of specific evolutionary hypotheses accounting for observed macroecological patterns. We illustrate the usefulness of the method using the phylogeny of the genus Sebastes (Pisces: Scorpaeniformes), together with data on the body size-latitudinal range relationship to estimate the effect of phylogenetic history on the observed macroecological pattern. © 2013 The Authors.

This group is closely related to the Synallaxis moesta complex that occurs in the Andes, Tepuis, and Guianan shield. Here we used mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences to infer the phylogeny and the time of diversification of the S. ruficapilla and S. moesta complexes. We also included samples of an undescribed population of Synallaxis that resembles other populations of the S. ruficapilla complex. Our results showed that different geographical lineages within the S. ruficapilla complex are reciprocally monophyletic, but the northern form (S. infuscata) grouped with an Andean taxon. This suggests that at least two lineages of this group independently colonized the Atlantic Forest. Specimens of the undescribed population formed a monophyletic clade with deep divergence. Estimated diversification dates were within the late Pliocene to Pleistocene (2.75-0.16. million of years ago). This suggests that at this time there was a higher connectivity between habitats in the rugged landscapes of the circum-Amazonian bioregions. The observed Pleistocene diversification within the Atlantic Forest is congruent in space and time with studies of other co-distributed organisms, and may be associated with climate changes and tectonic activity during this period. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","The objective of this work was to establish the genetic relationship between Guabalá and Guaymi cattle populations and some native ones of Latin America. Factorial correspondence analysis, analysis of molecular variance, genetic distances, average number of migrants per population and Wright's F statistics were performed. Population structure was assessed by a Bayesian model, assuming an unknown number of K genetically distinct groups. The correspondence analysis showed that the populations of Guabalá and Guaymí cluster with Mexican creole cattle and Texas Longhorn. Lower genetic differentiation of Panamanian creole with Mexican and Texas Longhorn was also observed. The analyses of genetic distances have also shown similar results to those obtained by Amova and by the factorial correspondence analysis, and the less distance was observed between north populations and Panamanian ones, in comparison with southern populations. Bayesian clustering permitted the assignment of individuals to their respective groups, based on their genetic similarity, and provided information on the number of cluster from which they originate. There is a close historical, genetic, and geographic relationship of Panamanian, Mexican, and Texas Longhorn populations due to the migration of precursors from the Caribbean islands to Panama and Mexico.","At the macroevolutionary level, one of the first and most important hypotheses that proposes an evolutionary tendency in the evolution of body sizes is \"Cope's rule\". This rule has considerable empirical support in the fossil record and predicts that the size of species within a lineage increases over evolutionary time. Nevertheless, there is also a large amount of evidence indicating the opposite pattern of miniaturization over evolutionary time. A recent analysis using a single phylogenetic tree approach and a Bayesian based model of evolution found no evidence for Cope's rule in extant mammal species. Here we utilize a likelihood-based phylogenetic method, to test the evolutionary trend in body size, which considers phylogenetic uncertainty, to discern between Cope's rule and miniaturization, using extant Oryzomyini rodents as a study model. We evaluated body size trends using two principal predictions: (a) phylogenetically related species are more similar in their body size, than expected by chance; (b) body size increased (Cope's rule)/decreased (miniaturization) over time. Consequently the distribution of forces and/or constraints that affect the tendency are homogenous and generate this directional process from a small/large sized ancestor. Results showed that body size in the Oryzomyini tribe evolved according to phylogenetic relationships, with a positive trend, from a small sized ancestor. Our results support that the high diversity and specialization currently observed in the Oryzomyini tribe is a consequence of the evolutionary trend of increased body size, following and supporting Cope's rule. © 2012 Avaria-Llautureo et al.","This paper proposes a new methodology to evaluate system generating capacity reliability indices considering time-dependent power sources and loads. Based on sequential Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and the cross-entropy (CE) method, the basic idea is to find an optimal distortion for the equipment transition rates using the CE concepts. A chronological simulation is then carried out using these newly found optimal reference parameters. This process suitably modifies the chronological evolution of the system in order to improve its statistical efficiency and convergence properties. As a result, the computational efforts of the sequential simulation can be greatly reduced while retaining many of its main advantages.

Twelve out of 19 districts in the department were selected and 33 farms with growers in the selected districts were recruited. Questionnaire interviews for each study farm, in combination with faecal sample collections (n = 30 per farm), which were microbiologic ally examined and visual inspection of pig production facilities were performed between March and November 2009. A questionnaire was designed to obtain basic information of a farm such as the number of pigs owned and some selected farming management practices. Faecal samples were used for Salmonella isolation, using buffered peptone water to have salmonellae pre-enriched, followed by xylose lysine tergitol 4 agar and brilliant green sulfapyridine agar. Suspect colonies were bio chemically tested by triple sugar iron agar in combination with lysine iron agar to confirm the identity. The true frequency probability and associated 95% Bayesian credible intervals (95% BCI) were computed via the Gibbs sampler, a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique. Overall, 18% (95% BCI: 8-31%) of the tested 1000 faecal samples were classified as positive for Salmonella enterica. All the study farms had at least one positive sample for Salmonella enterica (frequency range: 3-60%). Apparent prevalence at farm-level was therefore 100% (one-sided 97.5% confidence limit: 89%). Twenty-eight different serovars for Salmonella enterica were found. Based on increase the number of study districts, farms as well as animals in combination with improvement of sampling methods, possible spatial differences and risk factors/indicators should be clarified by further investigations.© 2011 Academic Journals Inc.","This paper proposes a new methodology to assess system reliability considering time-dependent power sources and loads.

The inadequate farm management methods commonly used in backyard chickens make them a potential reservoir for economically important diseases such as infectious bronchitis that can affect commercial poultry operations. There are no earlier studies on a survey of Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) amongst backyard chicken population in Paraguay. The objectives of this study were: (1) to observe the seroprevalence of IBV in backyard chickens in Paraguay and (2) to generate maps for estimated seroprevalence using Bayesian techniques for IBV in the study chickens and for smoothed Relative Risks (RR) drawn by one of the techniques above, in place of using the observed seroprevalence. Paraguay consists of 17 departments. A department-stratified random sampling was designed and implemented. The required total sample size of 1537 from a chicken population of 17 million was adequate to produce a 95% confidence interval with a desired precision of ±2.5% when the estimated seroprevalence was 50%. Sera were analyzed using a commercial indirect ELISA. The overall observed antibody seroprevalence was 80%. The resulting maps for the estimated seroprevalence for IBV using Bayesian techniques in the study chickens at department level, and for the smoothed RRs were illustrated. Different types of epidemiological parameters can be computed to take account of potential risk factors. Therefore, further detailed studies into those risk factors associated with IBV appearance with respect to spatially epidemiological variations would be of interest. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2009.","The objectives of this study were (1) to fit linear mixed models for Maternally Derived Antibody (MDA) values for estimating optimal days of age for Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD) vaccination in broiler chicks and (2) to evaluate how optimal vaccination timing estimates varied, based on the field data collected in Paraguay. The MDA titres were measured by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) with sera collected from 20 chicks per flock (n = 14) at 1, 8 and 15 days of age. Both Restricted Maximum-likelihood (REML) and Markov Chain-Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation methods were used to fit linear mixed models for the dependent variable log-transformed MDA. There is a slight dissimilarity of each estimate between the two models because of the difference in mathematical algorithms and handling method of missing data. The study flocks with the earliest and latest estimated optimal timing for vaccination had a mean days of age of 15.1 [95% Bayesian Credible Interval (BCI): 13.3-17.0] and 23.7 [95% BCI: 21.7-25.7], respectively. This variation could be partly explained by a limited understanding of the true biological variability representing the variety of factors affecting MDA in the study chicks. Although the results of the study can be used as a benchmark to establish IBD vaccination programmes in the study area, it is recommended for estimating optimal IBD vaccination timing to measure the MDA level by ELISA tests on a routine basis. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2009.","Buteonine hawks represent one of the most diverse groups in the Accipitridae, with 58 species distributed in a variety of habitats on almost all continents. Variations in migratory behavior, remarkable dispersal capability, and unusual diversity in Central and South America make buteonine hawks an excellent model for studies in avian evolution. To evaluate the history of their global radiation, we used an integrative approach that coupled estimation of the phylogeny using a large sequence database (based on 6411 bp of mitochondrial markers and one nuclear intron from 54 species), divergence time estimates, and ancestral state reconstructions. Our findings suggest that Neotropical buteonines resulted from a long evolutionary process that began in the Miocene and extended to the Pleistocene. Colonization of the Nearctic, and eventually the Old World, occurred from South America, promoted by the evolution of seasonal movements and development of land bridges. Migratory behavior evolved several times and may have contributed not only to colonization of the Holarctic, but also derivation of insular species. In the Neotropics, diversification of the buteonines included four disjunction events across the Andes. Adaptation of monophyletic taxa to wet environments occurred more than once, and some relationships indicate an evolutionary connection among mangroves, coastal and várzea environments. On the other hand, groups occupying the same biome, forest, or open vegetation habitats are not monophyletic. Refuges or sea-level changes or a combination of both was responsible for recent speciation in Amazonian taxa. In view of the lack of concordance between phylogeny and classification, we propose numerous taxonomic changes. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We evaluated this hypothesis for South American mole-mice using conventional and Bayesian frameworks, with independent evidence. By using a molecular approach based on Cytochrome b and IRBP sequences, we evaluated phylogenetic relationships, time of origin, the ancestral trait of fossoriality, and ancestral distributions of species belonging to the Andean Clade (Rodentia: Sigmodontinae). Our results indicate that the Andean Clade is highly sustained; with one clade grouping all fossorial forms and another grouping all cursorial species. We hypothesized that fossoriality originated in the Miocene/Pliocene transition, in the Temperate Forests of southern South America. We conclude that the origin of fossorial ecomorphological traits did not necessarily occur under a general model of open environments, the origin of these traits depends on the ecological-historical relationship of the taxon with the environment. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The strategies aim at achieving fair access, fair transmission rate or simultaneous fair access and transmission rate. As a case study, the performance of the considered strategies is evaluated in GSM/EGPRS networks in terms of call blocking probability for voice packet data users and system throughput. However, the analysis is valid for any Radio Transmission Technology that uses LA techniques. For the mathematical analysis, packet data traffic (i.e., IP) is modeled as a process showing pseudo-long range dependence. In particular, to capture their bursty nature, packet data arrivals are considered to follow a Modulated Markov Poisson Process (MMPP) process. Numerical results show that voice calls get lower blocking probability than data packet transmissions when a fair access resource allocation strategy is used. Also, a trade off between (access and/or transmission rate) fairness and system utilization is observed. Finally, it is also shown that high grade of burstiness significantly degrades the system performance. © 2007 IEEE.","The Cracidae is one of the most endangered bird families in the World. Several studies have been published recently on the evolution and conservation of cracids. Phylogenetic analyses using a fragment of 661 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene for 39 different species of cracids corroborated most relationships found in previous studies. The present work attempts to refine the former phylogenetic hypothesis by increasing taxon sampling and combining molecular with osteological, integumentary and behavioural characters using Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Bayesian analyses. We present both separate and combined total evidence analyses with our molecular data, 152 osteological and 74 integumentary + behavioural characters. While supporting most aspects of the molecular-based hypotheses, the tree based on the combined matrix suggests several modifications of the generic composition for each of the two subfamilies: Penelopinae and Cracinae, and supports the merging of the genera Pipile with Aburria and Mitu with Pauxi. These results suggest that increased taxon and character sampling from a diversity of sources may be at least as important as increased sampling of only one type. Besides, of a total of 891 characters we had 437 parsimony-informative sites (almost half of the analyzable sites) proving the efficiency of a total-evidence approach. © 2007 The Authors.","The Cracidae are Neotropical galliform birds with 11 genera currently recognized. To investigate the questioned validity of Pipile Bonaparte, 1856 and the monotypic Aburria Reichenbach, 1853 as separate genera, we gathered data from 2727 bp of mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome b, ND2 and control region) and 151 osteological characters. Our phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences indicated that Aburria aburri is embedded within Pipile. Also, genetic distances between Aburria and any Pipile species are equivalent to the distances estimated for other congeneric cracid species, which genus status is not doubtful. Although the osteological characters do not have phylogenetic signal to solve the phylogenetic relationships at species level, five synapomorphies were found for Aburria and Pipile. Therefore, we suggest that Pipile should be merged with Aburria, which is the oldest described genus. We estimated that speciation in this group occurred in the Plio-Pleistocene, concordant with other birds, primates and rodents that have similar geographic distribution, and proposed a diversification hypothesis based on the occurrence of sea transgressions and the formation of the Amazon Lagoon. Therefore, we conclude that these palaeogeographic events may have contributed to Neotropical taxa diversification to a greater extent than previously suspected. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.
