We have performed this analysis in a cross-sectional sample of 899 healthy young subjects of the Human Connectome Project. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using causal inference to explain the relationship between cingulate morphology and the performance of executive tasks in healthy subjects. We have tested the causal model under a counterfactual framework using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting and marginal structural models. The results showed that the posterior cingulate surface area has a positive causal effect on inhibition (Flanker task) and cognitive flexibility (Card Sort). A unit increase (+1 mm2) in the posterior cingulate surface area will cause a 0.008% and 0.009% increase from the National Institute of Health (NIH) normative mean in Flankers (p-value <0.001), and Card Sort (p-value 0.005), respectively. Furthermore, a unit increase (+1 mm2) in the anterior cingulate surface area will cause a 0.004% (p-value <0.001) and 0.005% (p-value 0.001) increase from the NIH normative mean in Flankers and Card Sort. In contrast, the curvature-corrected-mean thickness only showed an association for anterior cingulate with List Sort (p = 0.034) but no causal effect. © 2022 The Authors.

Clearly, the success of such an endeavor will depend on the amount of information that the patient-specific variables convey about the individual causal treatment effect on the response of interest. In the present work, using causal inference and information theory, a strategy is proposed to evaluate individual predictive factors for cancer immunotherapy efficacy. In a first step, the methodology proposes a causal inference model to describe the joint distribution of the pretreatment predictors and the individual causal treatment effect. Further, in a second step, the so-called predictive causal information (PCI), a metric that quantifies the amount of information the pretreatment predictors convey on the individual causal treatment effects, is introduced and its properties are studied. The methodology is applied to identify predictors of therapeutic success for a therapeutic vaccine in advanced lung cancer.

Methods: We propose a framework, Comparative Disease Assessment (CDA), for assessing the impact of exposure to morbidity from some diseases on health outcomes, particularly death from other (relevant) diseases. This framework has been developed following the ideas of the CRA framework and using the widely accepted concept that exposure to morbidity is usually a risk factor for health outcomes (morbidity/mortality) related to other diseases. Our framework uses a counterfactual and not a categorical approach when attributing the burden of health outcomes to potential causes. Results: This paper describes the different steps and assumptions required to implement the CDA framework, and an illustrative example is used considering diabetes mellitus morbidity as a risk factor for death from heart diseases. Conclusions: One advantage of the CDA framework is that it can be applied using multi-causal death registries. Some assumptions are needed to implement it in order to avoid biases, but at least it can provide preliminary estimations of the impact of exposure to diseases as risk factors for deaths from other diseases. Another main advantage is that the burden of deaths is no longer attributed to a single cause, the underlying cause, as it is almost always done. Finally, this framework provides information on the pattern of comorbidity in a (sub)population of subjects who is about to die. These patterns can be used as a reference for alternative patterns of the general population or patterns of other specific subpopulations. © 2020, The Author(s).","<b>Real-time dynamics in diluted quantum networks<\/b><br><br>We introduce an approach to characterize the dynamics of disordered quantum networks. Each quantum element (i.e., each node) of the network experiences the other nodes as an effective environment that can be self-consistently represented by a Feynman-Vernon influence functional. For networks having the topology of locally treelike graphs, these Feynman-Vernon (FV) functionals can be determined by a new version of the cavity or belief propagation (BP) method. Here, we find the fixed point solution of this version of BP for a network of uniform quantum harmonic oscillators. Then, we estimate the effects of the disorder in these networks within the replica symmetry ansatz. We show that over a large time interval, at small disorder, the real part of the FV functional induces decoherence and classicality while at sufficiently large disorder the Feynman-Vernon functional tends to zero and the coherence survives, signaling in a time setting, the onset of an Anderson's transition. © 2022 authors.

Magnolia, a flagship tree genus that has 15 endemic and threatened taxa (12 species and 3 subspecies) on the Caribbean islands, offers an excellent case study to empirically test Caribbean biogeographical hypotheses. We constructed phylogenetic hypotheses to: (1) reveal their evolutionary history, (2) test the current largely morphology-based classification and assess species limits, and (3) investigate major biogeographic hypotheses proposed for the region. Nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequence data of all 15 Caribbean Magnolia taxa are included, supplemented by a selection of American mainland species, and species representing most major clades of the Magnoliaceae family. We constructed phylogenetic hypotheses in a time-calibrated Bayesian framework, supplemented with haplotype network analyses and ancestral range estimations. Genetic synapomorphies in the studied markers confirm the species limits of 14 out of 15 morphologically recognizable Caribbean Magnolia taxa. There is evidence for four colonization events of Magnolia into the Caribbean from the American mainland, which most likely occurred by overwater dispersal, given age estimates of maximum 16 mya for their presence on the Caribbean islands. © 2021 The Authors","<b>Multiview Object and View Sequence Recognition using Hidden Markov Models<\/b><br><br>This work presents a method for multiview object recognition and the estimation of the sequence of object views.

Objective: To estimate the impact and effectiveness of Abdala vaccine in the face of symptomatic disease of reported cases and death in hospitals in Matanzas province. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, with a cohort of vaccinated people consisting of 252,557 people who met the three-dose schedule, and another of unvaccinated or who had not complied with the complete vaccination schedule of 325,462 people. Age and personal pathological history were explored. As a source of information, the registry of confirmed cases and deaths issued by the Ministry of Public Health and the automated vaccination base Andariego Higia were used. It was calculated the effectiveness (VE=1-RR) and by confidence intervals and analyzed epidemiological indicators with the Bayesian structural time series method. Results: The effectiveness against symptomatic disease and death was 75.5 % and 95.7 %, respectively. In the analysis of the causal impact, values of reduction of 90.0% of the reported incidence and 86.0% of mortality were evidenced with respect to the expected figures. Conclusions: Abdala vaccine showed high effectiveness and impact in the prevention of symptomatic disease and death in real-world conditions. © 2022, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

Talauma in Cuba has been largely debated and changed. Some authors have considered the variability of the group in a single taxon while others have divided it into two, three, and four-taxa. The present work aimed to model the ecological niche of the Cuban taxa of Magnolia subsect. Talauma, and identify which of the three main classification systems for these taxa aligns better with the ecological niche model analysis. We used fieldwork data and herbarium specimens as occurrence data. As niche predictors, we used variables from the WorldClim database. After a preparation process (spatial thinning of occurrences, pre-model, candidate models) the ecological niche models were made in Maxent, considering different taxonomic classifications proposed. Annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality were the variables with the highest contribution to the models of all the taxa, except for M. orbiculata (Maximum temperature and elevation). The ecological niche models of Magnolia subsect. Talauma in Cuba showed the mountains of Sierra Maestra and Nipe-Sagua-Baracoa as the most suitable areas for these taxa; no matter the classification system used. Magnolia orbiculata had the smallest areas of niche suitability, and was the only taxon with a different ecological niche, supporting its status of species. The taxa of the north-eastern showed a high level of ecological similarity, making impossible to determine which classification system has the higher support, and which are the ecological limits of the taxa. © 2022 Universidad de La Habana.

We present a graph SLAM system based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) where the sensor readings are represented with different symbols using a number of clustering techniques; then, the symbols are fused as a single prediction, to improve the accuracy rate, using a Dual HMM. Our system’s versatility allows to work with different types of sensors or fusion of sensors, and to implement, either active or passive, graph SLAM. A graph-SLAM approach proposed by the International’s Karto Robotics in Cartographer, the nodes represent the pose of the robot and the edges the constraints between them. Nodes are usually defined according to contiguous nodes except when loop closures are detected where constraints for non-contiguous nodes are introduced, which corrects the whole graph. Detecting loop closure is not trivial; in the ROS implementation, scan matching is performed by Sparse Pose Adjustment (SPA). Cartographer uses an occupancy map in order to estimate the position where the map representation is done via Gmapping. The Toyota HSR (Human Support Robot) robot was used to generate the data set in both real and simulated competition environments. In our SLAM representation, we have wheel odometry estimate according to initial position of the robot, a Hokuyo 2D Lidar scan for observations, and a signal control and a world representation is estimated. We tested our system in the kidnapped robot problem by training a representation, improving it online, and, finally, solving the SLAM problem. © Korenevsky S.N., 2021.","<b>Ancestral sequence reconstruction for co-evolutionary models<\/b><br><br>The ancestral sequence reconstruction problem is the inference, back in time, of the properties of common sequence ancestors from the measured properties of contemporary populations. Standard algorithms for this problem assume independent (factorized) evolution of the characters of the sequences, which is generally wrong (e.g. proteins and genome sequences). In this work, we have studied this problem for sequences described by global co-evolutionary models, which reproduce the global pattern of cooperative interactions between the elements that compose it. For this, we first modeled the temporal evolution of correlated real valued characters by a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on a finite tree. This represents sequences as Gaussian vectors evolving in a quadratic potential, who describe the selection forces acting on the evolving entities. Under a Bayesian framework, we developed a reconstruction algorithm for these sequences and obtained an analytical expression to quantify the quality of our estimation. We extend this formalism to discrete valued sequences by applying our method to a Potts model. We showed that for both continuous and discrete configurations, there is a wide range of parameters where, to properly reconstruct the ancestral sequences, intra-species correlations must be taken into account. We also demonstrated that, for sequences with discrete elements, our reconstruction algorithm outperforms traditional schemes based on independent site approximations. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA Medialab srl.","<b>Integrative taxonomy clarifies species limits in the hitherto monotypic passion-vine butterfly genera Agraulis and Dryas (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae, Heliconiinae)<\/b><br><br>The Heliconiini genera Agraulis and Dryas are widely distributed throughout the Neotropics and into adjacent temperate regions, and although they are currently treated as monotypic, both show significant geographic phenotypic variation. In this work, we employ six genetic markers (4199 bp), two mitochondrial and four nuclear, to perform coalescent species delimitation analyses in Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BPP) and in integrated BPP (iBPP), the latter also includes linear measurements and wings landmarks. We also analyze cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) barcode sequences for each genus using genetic distances, haplotype networks and a character-based approach. Based on the model testing results, complemented with data from previous studies, we performed morphometric analyses to compare fore and hindwing size, aspect ratio and shape among the new species. In addition, we compared the forewing spot pattern of hypothesizes species using the r package patternize and, for Dryas, compared the colour patterns of mature larvae. Model testing of the molecular species delimitation outputs favoured a seven species hypothesis for Agraulis and a four species hypothesis for Dryas. Average distances among COI barcode sequences of these groups were from 1.09 to 5.81% in Agraulis and from 1.09 to 3.44% in Dryas. Within-group distances ranged from 0 to 1.11% and between 0 and 2.43%, respectively. NeighborNet haplotype networks showed that all but one of the species are monophyletic, and the character-based approach found exclusive diagnostic positions for most species, while the rest can be recognized by unique combinations of the 44 informative nucleotide positions analysed. Morphometric analysis supported all species of Agraulis and Dryas based on wing shape, and also in several cases on wing sizes and aspect ratio (hindwing length–forewing length), including A. v. galapagensis, which was absent from the molecular study. The analysis of the forewing spot pattern also revealed differences among most species hypothesis. The colour pattern of the last instar larva is also diagnostic for each Dryas species hypothesis. Locality data for species in both genera show that most of them are allopatric albeit a few have contact zones being parapatric at some locations. Based on the observed genetic differences, which covary with morphology and geographical distribution, we recommend the recognition of eight species of Agraulis: A. incarnata, A. vanillae, A. forbesi new status, A. insularis reinstated status, A. maculosa new status, A. lucina reinstated status, A. galapagensis new status and one undescribed species, and four species of Dryas: D. iulia, D. dominicana revised status, D. lucia revised status and D. alcionea reinstated status. Further work is needed to investigate, which selective forces have led to the current configurations of venation and wing shape, the probable gene flow among species with a focus on Agraulis and gather more data on species ecology.

For implementing sensitivity analysis, several multiple imputation methods exist, like sequential imputation, which restricts to monotone missingness, and Bayesian, where the imputation and analysis models differ, entailing overestimation of variance. Also, full conditional specification provides a conditional interpretation of sensitivity parameters, requiring further calibration to get the desired marginal interpretation. We propose in this paper a multiple imputation procedure, based on a multivariate linear regression model, which keeps compatibility in sensitivity analysis under intermittent missingness, providing a marginal interpretation of the elicited parameters. Simulation studies show that the method behaves well with longitudinal data and remains robust under demanding constraints. We conclude the possibility of situations not covered by the existing methods and well suited for our proposal, which allows more efficient handling of a given multivariate linear regression structure. Its use is illustrated in a real case study, where a sensitivity analysis is accomplished. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","<b>Conservation of aquatic insects in Neotropical regions: A gap analysis using potential distributions of diving beetles in Cuba<\/b><br><br>Human activities are an increasing threat to Neotropical freshwater ecosystems, with the potential extinction of thousands of aquatic species. Despite this, knowledge about the effectiveness of protected area networks in protecting aquatic insects in this biogeographical region is very limited. Cuba supports the highest diversity of aquatic insects in the Antilles, with a large number of endemics. A gap analysis was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the National System of Protected Areas of Cuba (NSPAC) in the conservation of Cuban diving beetles (family Dytiscidae). This involved considering the areas with the highest potential species richness, estimated by using species distribution models with three different approaches (MaxEnt, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine), and the known localities of endemic species. The highest potential species richness of Dytiscidae in Cuba is predicted to occur in the low–medium altitude of the eastern mountain areas. Although most of these areas occur inside the NSPAC, several areas of potential high species richness are currently unprotected. It is recommended that sampling programmes are carried out in areas with high predicted species richness to validate the species distribution models. The distribution of three Cuban endemic species (Copelatus barbouri, Desmopachria glabella and Celina cubensis) lies completely outside of the NSPAC. Despite their conservation interest as threatened endemic species, they are currently unprotected. To improve the conservation of freshwater biodiversity in Cuba it is recommended that (i) the NSPAC network is extended to protect areas supporting endemic species and those with the highest potential species richness that are currently unprotected, and (ii) a whole-catchment management approach, specifically to maintain natural flows, should be adopted, especially in the mountainous areas of eastern Cuba. © 2021 The Authors.

However, in several applications, such as biology, data result from stochastic evolutionary processes, and configurations are related through a hierarchical structure, typically represented by a tree, and therefore not independent. In turn, empirical averages of observables superpose intrinsic signals related to the equilibrium distribution of the studied system, and spurious historical (or phylogenetic) signals resulting from the structure underlying the data-generating process. The naive application of inverse statistical physics techniques therefore leads to systematic biases and an effective reduction of the sample size. To advance on the currently open task of extracting intrinsic signals from correlated data, we study a system described by a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process defined on a finite tree. Using a Bayesian framework, we can disentangle covariances in the data corresponding to their multivariate Gaussian equilibrium distribution from those resulting from the historical correlations. Our approach leads to a clear gain in accuracy in the inferred equilibrium distribution, which corresponds to an effective two to fourfold increase in sample size. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA Medialab srl.","<b>Distribution of macroalgae epiphytes and host species from the Cuban marine shelf inferred from ecological modelling<\/b><br><br>Ecological Niche Modelling (ENM) is a tool widely used in ecology to determine environmental conditions and the potential distribution of species. In this article we assess the potential distribution, tolerance limits and similarity niche of macroalgae epiphytes and hosts from the Cuba marine shelf. Using different methods (BIOCLIM, Gower, Maxent and SVM) we have modelled the niche for each species. The final prediction map of distribution was made using the ensemble prediction technique. The similarity of ENMs was quantified by Schoener D and Hellinger I distance. The predictive power of all models was reasonable, since the values of the area under the curve (AUC) were greater than 0.9. The host macroalgae most closely related to the spatial distribution pattern of potential abundance of epiphytic macroalgae are Stypopodium zonale (Kendall correlation, r2 = 0.886) and Digenea simplex (Kendall correlation, r2 = 0.777). Environmental variables that contributed mostly (30 %) to the ecological niche models were: the average maximum salinity per year (35.5−36 PSU); the average minimum flow velocity per year (0.2 m·s−1) and the average minimum light at ground level per year (10−60 E·m−2·yr−1). The results show that epiphytic macroalgae and their most common hosts are generalist species (niche width 0.8) with high overlap in their niche (Schoener D > 0.7; Hellinger I distance = I > 0.6). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Using integrated Bayesian-Petri Net method for individual impact assessment of domino effect accidents<\/b><br><br>One of the aims of Cleaner Production refers to the reduction of risks for the human population. Domino effect accidents trigger the worst consequences in process industries. To date, several techniques and models have been used for predicting domino effect probability, such as Bayesian networks and Petri Nets. In addition, these methodologies can be combined with other classical ones, for instance, Event and Fault Trees. However, there is no mentioned methodology in specialized literature which accurately combines them in order to predict the individual impact of domino effect accidents. This paper focuses on the quantification of the individual impact of domino effect scenarios using an Integrated Bayesian- Petri Net method. For this purpose, a model of seven steps is proposed based on a combination of proven methods to obtain a new one with the advantages of both graphical structures, including the ability to minimize their limitations. To prove the validity of the new model, this model and other three ones are applied in a hydrocarbon storage area as well. The application of the proposed model in this area allows to reduce the incident occurrence by 59%. That is why we can assure that the proposed study is vital for preserving resources and minimizing risk to individual's life in hydrocarbon facilities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","<b>Treatment with an Anti-CK2 Synthetic Peptide Improves Clinical Response in COVID-19 Patients with Pneumonia. A Randomized and Controlled Clinical Trial<\/b><br><br>The instrumental role of CK2 in the SARS-CoV-2 infection has pointed out this protein kinase as promising therapeutic target in COVID-19. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity has been reported by CK2 inhibitors in vitro; however, no anti-CK2 clinical approach has been investigated in COVID-19. This trial aimed to explore the safety and putative clinical benefit of CIGB-325, an anti-CK2 peptide previously assessed in cancer patients. A monocentric, controlled, and therapeutic exploratory trial of intravenous CIGB-325 in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 was performed. Twenty patients were randomly assigned to receive CIGB-325 (2.5 mg/kg/day during 5-consecutive days) plus standard-of-care (10 patients) or standard-of-care alone (10 patients). Adverse events were classified by the WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology. Parametric and nonparametric statistical analyses were performed according to the type of variable. Considering the small sample size, differences between groups were estimated by Bayesian analysis. CIGB-325 induced transient mild and/or moderate adverse events such as pruritus, flushing, and rash in some patients. Both therapeutic regimens were similar with respect to SARS-CoV-2 clearance in nasopharynx swabs over time. However, CIGB-325 significantly reduced the median number of pulmonary lesions (9.5 to 5.5, p = 0.042) at day 7 and the proportion of patients with such an effect was also higher according to Bayesian analysis (pDif > 0; 0.951). Also, CIGB-325 significantly reduced the CPK (p = 0.007) and LDH (p = 0.028) plasma levels at day 7. Our preliminary findings suggest that this anti-CK2 clinical approach could be combined with standard-of-care in COVID-19 in larger studies. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","<b>Local Adaptive Bivariate Shrinkage Function for Seisogram Wavelet Based Denoising<\/b><br><br>This paper presents an effective and wavelet-based seismogram denoising algorithm that considers the dependencies between the wavelet coefficients and their parents. For this purpose, a non-Gaussian bivariate distributions is used and corresponding nonlinear threshold function (shrinkage function) is derived using Bayesian estimation theory, in particular the maximum a posteriori estimator. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, the method is applied to seismograms that are corrupted with additive Gaussian noise over a wide range of noise variance. Experimental results are compared with different denoising schemes. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method not only outperforms the other denoising algorithms in terms of SNR but also helps retain other important information like the P-phase onsets. © 2003-2012 IEEE.","<b>A new Fuzzy-Bayesian approach for the determination of failure probability due to thermal radiation in domino effect accidents<\/b><br><br>In recent years, domino effect accidents and domino effect prediction have been intensively studied by the scientific community. The reason for this is the serious impact of these phenomena on people, the environment, the economy, and society as well. In addition, the European Commission has defined this type of study as mandatory. One scenario that can lead to domino effect propagation is a pool fire, which has high values of thermal radiation. This research proposes a novel five-step approach for the determination of failure probability, especially when taking into consideration the structure mechanism of failure in the case of domino effect propagation due to pool fires. In addition, the determination of time to failure, escalation probability, as well as failure due to the received thermal radiation are combined using expert criteria (Fuzzy logic) to obtain an overall failure probability. In all cases, failure due to the decreasing of the strength material is very likely, due to the actual shape thickness of all of the process units. Highest values of failure probability correspond to process units which are in the same subarea. In order to quantify synergic effects, a Bayesian network is developed resulting in domino effect probabilities of 1.0000E−4, which means that there is a high probability of domino effect occurrence. In order to validate the new proposed approach, this approach in combination with another are applied to an actual hydrocarbon storage area as well. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","<b>A Hybrid Brain-Computer Interface using Extreme Learning Machines for Motor Intention Detection<\/b><br><br>This work proposes a hybrid brain-computer interface (HBCI) using Bayesian method to fuse information from electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography signals (EMG) for decoding movement intention. For EEG signal feature extraction, Riemannian covariance matrices are computed, whereas other three features into the time and frequency domain are extracted from each EMG channel, such as autoregressive models, signal slope changes, and zero crossing. In this approach, the Bayesian fusion method is used to combine predictions from Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) classifiers. Our proposed HBCI obtained average accuracy of 96.26%, recall of 93.97, kappa of 0.78, and false positive rate of 3.31%, outperforming solution only based on EEG or EMG, suggesting its potential for neuro-rehabilitation applications. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>Managing Deep Learning Uncertainty for Unmanned Systems<\/b><br><br>Unmanned or Autonomous Systems act in an uncertain world. In order to plan and make decisions, autonomous systems can only rely on noisy perceptions and approximated models. The data collected from sensors is inherently uncertain due to noise, incompleteness, and inconsistency. The analysis of such massive amounts of data requires advanced analytical techniques for efficiently reviewing and/or predicting future courses of action with high precision and advanced decision-making strategies. Due to the amount, variety, and speed of data increases, so too does the uncertainty inherent within, leading to a lack of confidence in the resulting analytics process and decisions made thereof. Under these conditions, deep learning algorithms can be fully integrated into robotic systems only if a measure of prediction uncertainty is available. Prediction uncertainty in deep neural networks generally derives from two sources: data uncertainty and model uncertainty. The former arises because of noise in the data, usually caused by the sensors’ imperfections. The latter instead is generated from unbalances in the training data distribution. The article describes the developing fully autonomous vehicles at three levels, namely, perception, planning and control. Ideas from artificial intelligence have also been used to solve planning problems for autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles have to deal with dynamic, non-stationary- and highly unpredictable operational environments. For the right understanding of this process, is described the best-known control strategies, map representation techniques, interaction with external systems, including pedestrian interactions under an informational conception of Internet of Things and Big Data Uncertainty and Uncertainty in Machine Learning, The article shows an analysis of the most promissory methods for treating the deep leaning uncertainty: Bayesian Deep Learning, which is an intersection between deep learning and Bayesian probability approaches and the Fuzzy logic machine learning, in an Internet of Things framework. For the validation of theoretical explanations, it was proposed some simulations tools for visualizing and interpreting the uncertainty in the previously mentioned models and in the internet of things framework in different environments, useful for teaching and research. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>Generating reactive robots' behaviors using genetic algorithms<\/b><br><br>In this paper, we analize and benchmark three genetically-evolved reactive obstacle-avoidance behaviors for mobile robots. We buit these behaviors with an optimization process using genetic algorithms to find the one allowing a mobile robot to best reactively avoid obstacles while moving towards its destination. We compare three approaches, the first one is a standard method based on potential fields, the second one uses on finite state machines (FSM), and the last one relies on HMM-based probabilistic finite state machines (PFSM). We trained the behaviors in simulated environments to obtain the optimizated behaviors and compared them to show that the evolved FSM approach outperforms the other two techniques. © 2021 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","<b>Mathematical modeling and forecasting of COVID-19: experience in Santiago de Cuba province<\/b><br><br>In the province of Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, the COVID-19 epidemic has a limited progression that shows an early small-number peak of infections. Most published mathematical models fit data with high numbers of confirmed cases. In contrast, small numbers of cases make it difficult to predict the course of the epidemic. We present two known models adapted to capture the noisy dynamics of COVID-19 in the Santiago de Cuba province. Parameters of both models were estimated using the approximate-Bayesian-computation framework with dedicated error laws. One parameter of each model was updated on key dates of travel restrictions. Both models approximately predicted the infection peak and the end of the COVID-19 epidemic in Santiago de Cuba. The first model predicted 57 reported cases and 16 unreported cases. Additionally, it estimated six initially exposed persons. The second model forecasted 51 confirmed cases at the end of the epidemic. In conclusion, an opportune epidemiological investigation, along with the low number of initially exposed individuals, might partly explain the favorable evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in Santiago de Cuba. With the available data, the simplest model predicted the epidemic evolution with greater precision, and the more complex model helped to explain the epidemic phenomenology. © 2021.

This might preclude the formation of appropriate face representations and, consequently, hamper effective recognition. The present ERP study, in combination with Bayesian source reconstruction, investigates how information related to both external (E) and internal (I) features was processed by E.C. and I.P., suffering from acquired and developmental prosopagnosia, respectively. They carried out a face-feature matching task with new faces. E.C. showed poor performance and remarkable lack of early face-sensitive P1, N170 and P2 responses on right (damaged) posterior cortex. Although she presented the expected mismatch effect to target faces in the E-I sequence, it was of shorter duration than in Controls, and involved left parietal, right frontocentral and dorsofrontal regions, suggestive of reduced neural circuitry to process face configurations. In turn, I.P. performed efficiently but with a remarkable bias to give “match” responses. His face-sensitive potentials P1–N170 were comparable to those from Controls, however, he showed no subsequent P2 response and a mismatch effect only in the I-E sequence, reflecting activation confined to those regions that sustain typically the initial stages of face processing. Relevantly, neither of the prosopagnosics exhibited conspicuous P3 responses to features acting as primes, indicating that diagnostic information for constructing face representations could not be sufficiently attended nor deeply encoded. Our findings suggest a different locus for altered neurocognitive mechanisms in the face network in participants with different types of prosopagnosia, but common indicators of a deficient allocation of attentional resources for further recognition. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","<b>Comparison of two objects classification techniques using hidden markov models and convolutional neural networks<\/b><br><br>This paper presents a comparison between discrete Hidden Markov Models and Convolutional Neural Networks for the image classification task. By fragmenting an image into sections, it is feasible to obtain vectors that represent visual features locally, but if a spatial sequence is established in a fixed way, it is possible to represent an image as a sequence of vectors. Using clustering techniques, we obtain an alphabet from said vectors and then symbol sequences are constructed to obtain a statistical model that represents a class of images. Hidden Markov Models, combined with quantization methods, can treat noise and distortions in observations for computer vision problems such as the classification of images with lighting and perspective changes. We have tested architectures based on three, six and nine hidden states favoring the detection speed and low memory usage. Also, two types of ensemble models were tested. We evaluated the precision of the proposed methods using a public domain data set, obtaining competitive results with respect to fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks, but using significantly less computing resources. This is of interest in the development of mobile robots with computers with limited battery life, but requiring the ability to detect and add new objects to their classification systems. © 2020 St. Petersburg Institute for Informatics and Automation of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Here, we illustrate the use of a causal inference model to identify predictive biomarkers of CIMAvaxEGF success in the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients. Methods: Data from a controlled clinical trial evaluating the effect of CIMAvax-EGF were analyzed retrospectively, following a causal inference approach. Pre-treatment potential predictive biomarkers included basal serum EGF concentration, peripheral blood parameters and immunosenescence biomarkers. The proportion of CD8 + CD28- T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD4/CD8 ratio and CD19+ B cells. The 33 patients with complete information were included. The predictive causal information (PCI) was calculated for all possible models. The model with a minimum number of predictors, but with high prediction accuracy (PCI > 0.7) was selected. Good, rare and poor responder patients were identified using the predictive probability of treatment success. Results: The mean of PCI increased from 0.486, when only one predictor is considered, to 0.98 using the multivariate approach with all predictors. The model considering the proportion of CD4+ T cell, basal Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) concentration, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, Monocytes, and Neutrophils as predictors were selected (PCI > 0.74). Patients predicted as good responders according to the pre-treatment biomarkers values treated with CIMAvax-EGF had a significant higher observed survival compared with the control group (p = 0.03). No difference was observed for bad responders. Conclusions: Peripheral blood parameters and immunosenescence biomarkers together with basal EGF concentration in serum resulted in good predictors of the CIMAvax-EGF success in advanced NSCLC. Future research should explore molecular and genetic profile as biomarkers for CIMAvax-EGF and it combination with immune-checkpoint inhibitors. The study illustrates the application of a new methodology, based on causal inference, to evaluate multivariate pre-treatment predictors. The multivariate approach allows realistic predictions of the clinical benefit of patients and should be introduced in daily clinical practice. © 2020 The Author(s).","<b>Museomics Unveil the Phylogeny and Biogeography of the Neglected Juan Fernandez Archipelago Megalachne and Podophorus Endemic Grasses and Their Connection With Relict Pampean-Ventanian Fescues<\/b><br><br>Oceanic islands constitute natural laboratories to study plant speciation and biogeographic patterns of island endemics. Juan Fernandez is a southern Pacific archipelago consisting of three small oceanic islands located 600–700 km west of the Chilean coastline. Exposed to current cold seasonal oceanic climate, these 5.8–1 Ma old islands harbor a remarkable endemic flora. All known Fernandezian endemic grass species belong to two genera, Megalachne and Podophorus, of uncertain taxonomic adscription. Classical and modern classifications have placed them either in Bromeae (Bromus), Duthieinae, Aveneae/Poeae, or Loliinae (fine-leaved Festuca); however, none of them have clarified their evolutionary relationships with respect to their closest Festuca relatives. Megalachne includes four species, which are endemic to Masatierra (Robinson Crusoe island) (M. berteroniana and M. robinsoniana) and to Masafuera (Alejandro Selkirk island) (M. masafuerana and M. dantonii). The monotypic Podophorus bromoides is a rare endemic species to Masatierra which is only known from its type locality and is currently considered extinct. We have used museomic approaches to uncover the challenging evolutionary history of these endemic grasses and to infer the divergence and dispersal patterns from their ancestors. Genome skimming data were produced from herbarium samples of M. berteroniana and M. masafuerana, and the 164 years old type specimen of P. bromoides, as well as for a collection of 33 species representing the main broad- and fine-leaved Loliinae lineages. Paired-end reads were successfully mapped to plastomes and nuclear ribosomal cistrons of reference Festuca species and used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees. Filtered ITS and trnTLF sequences from these genomes were further combined with our large Loliinae data sets for accurate biogeographic reconstruction. Nuclear and plastome data recovered a strongly supported fine-leaved Fernandezian clade where Podophorus was resolved as sister to Megalachne. Bayesian divergence dating and dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis range evolution analyses estimated the split of the Fernandezian clade from its ancestral southern American Pampas-Ventanian Loliinae lineage in the Miocene-Pliocene transition, following a long distance dispersal from the continent to the uplifted volcanic palaeo-island of Santa Clara-Masatierra. Consecutive Pliocene-Pleistocene splits and a Masatierra-to-Masafuera dispersal paved the way for in situ speciation of Podophorus and Megalachne taxa. © Copyright © 2020 Moreno-Aguilar, Arnelas, Sánchez-Rodríguez, Viruel and Catalán.","<b>Uncertainty calculation methods in dose assessment for dicentric chromosome assay<\/b><br><br>Purpose: To present the impact in coverage of different methods for Poisson confidence intervals and the impact in dose coverage of different uncertainty factors. A detailed explanation of the uncertainty sources in the Bayesian method is also presented. Materials and methods: The exact coverage of uncertainty Poisson confidence intervals and the dose uncertainty interval coverage were performed by simulations using R-based scripts. Results: The Poisson exact calibration interval via the Modified Crow and Gardner method resulted in coverage quite close to the nominal level of confidence; additionally, the method retains the shortest property of Crow and Gardner, and gains the property of a lower limit strictly increasing in the mean of dicentrics. The unlimited simultaneous calibration interval seems to be the method of choice to preserve the coverage at 95% under parametric and nonparametric conditions but is a conservative method. When samples came from a Poisson distribution, the ISO propagation of errors and Bayesian approaches seem to be the closest to the 95% coverage. Conclusions: The Modified Crow and Gardner method should be preferred over the Garwood method for Poisson exact confidence intervals. The unlimited simultaneous calibration interval did not lose its property to preserve the coverage at 95% applying a regression coverage factor of value 2.02 at the point of doses studied in the simulation. © 2020, Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.","<b>Monte Carlo simulation model to coordinate the preventive maintenance scheduling of generating units in isolated distributed Power Systems<\/b><br><br>The paper presents a risk-based model to coordinate the generators preventive maintenance of an isolated distributed Power System with wind generation presence. The model coordinates preventive maintenance minimizing the risk of loss of load probability in the Power System. The risk is estimated with a sequential Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation model. In this paper, the preventive maintenance scheduling (PMS) of the generating units is a non-linear stochastic optimization problem and it is efficiently solved with the algorithms Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). The model allows Power System operators to obtain a maintenance schedule that minimizes the risk of loss of load probability, as much as possible in the Power System; as well as establishing the desired level of risk. The model is applied in a Cuban Power System isolated from the main national power grid constituting a distributed system, and has the presence of a wind farm in its energetic matrix.

Assuming that contamination is a rare event (in space and time), we try to locate the most probable source of such events after reading contamination patterns in few sensed nodes. The method relies on strong simplifications considering binary clean/contaminated states for nodes in discrete time, and therefore focuses on the time structure of the sensed patterns rather than on the concentration levels. As a result, a posterior probability over discrete variables is written, and posterior marginals are computed using belief propagation algorithm. The resulting algorithm runs once on a given observation and reports probabilities for each node being the source and for the contamination patterns altogether. We test it on Anytown model, proving its efficacy even when only a single sensed node is known. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","<b>It is not a disaster: molecular and morphologically based phylogenetic analysis of Rondeletieae and the Rondeletia complex (Cinchonoideae, Rubiaceae)<\/b><br><br>The circumscription of Rondeletieae has changed considerably over time. Historically, 85 genera have been included, characterized by small trees, imbricate corolla aestivation and capsules. Molecular studies led to a narrower circumscription and stressed out that Rondeletieae is mainly an Antillean clade. As historically circumscribed, Rondeletieae is both polyphyletic (involving several tribes, including Condamineae, Sipaneeae, etc.) and paraphyletic with respect to Guettardeae. Uncertainties persist on the tribal circumscription, and its generic limits and relationships. We report results of phylogenetic analyses under parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses including 179 taxa, using concatenated datasets of three chloroplast DNA regions (petD, trnL–F and trnK–matK), their DNA microstructural characters as well as morphology. Our objectives are to: test the monophyly of Rondeletieae and evaluate phylogenetic relationships, evaluate potential characters for tribal and generic delimitation and propose a circumscription for Rondeletieae according to phylogenetic hypothesis using morphological characters. The tribes Guettardeae and Rondeletieae are strongly supported as sister: quincuncial aestivation and spathulate corolla lobes are proposed as a unique combination of characters supporting this relationship. We did not find synapomorphies for each tribe, but there is a set of character combinations that allows distinguishing both tribes that includes the corolla and pollen ornamentation as well as fruit and seed morphology. After evaluating other genera not included in the phylogenies, our proposal is that Rondeletieae contains approximately 120 species in 20 neotropical genera: Acrosynanthus, Acunaeanthus, Blepharidium, Donnellyanthus, Mazaea, Phyllomelia, Rachicallis, Roigella, Rondeletia, Rovaeanthus, Suberanthus, Tainus, plus one tentatively included and recently described (Jamaicanthus). © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","<b>Phylogenetic relationships and character evolution in neotropical Phyllanthus (Phyllanthaceae), with a focus on the cuban and caribbean taxa<\/b><br><br>Premise of research. The Caribbean is an important area of species diversity within the large pantropical genus Phyllanthus. With the goal of illuminating the evolutionary origins of Caribbean Phyllanthus, we undertook a phylogenetic analysis significantly increasing previous samplings of the genus in the Neotropics. We reconstructed the evolution of selected morphological characters and evaluated the implications of our results in light of the representation of Caribbean and Neotropical species in the infrageneric classification of the genus. Methodology. We estimated phylogentic trees using parsimony, Bayesian, and likelihood approaches based on plastid and nuclear sequence data sets. These represented 78 taxa from the Neotropics, most of which were generated for this study, as well as most other subgenera and sections of Phyllanthus and other genera of Phyllanthaceae. Four vegetative and four floral morphological characters were assessed for the whole study group. Ancestral character states were reconstructed using BayesTraits. Pivotal results. Plastid and nuclear partitions agree on a highly supported Caribbean clade that contains the vast majority of the species from this region as being part of a large Neotropical clade. Another small Caribbean clade is found nested among African linages. Although morphological characters exhibit some level of homoplasy, some trends are evident, for example, in the large Neotropical clade. Conclusions. The majority of species in the Caribbean belong to a single clade that has evolved from Neotropical ancestors. This is well circumscribed with morphology and corresponds to subgenus Xylophylla, the concept of which is adjusted here to be monophyletic. The existence of a small Caribbean clade related to African species marks a noteworthy case of Caribbean plant origin. Although phyllanthoid branching is not a synapomorphy for Phyllanthus s.l. (including Breynia, Glochidion, and Sauropus), combinations of vegetative and floral characters allow a clear assignment to the Phyllanthus s.l. clade. © 2020 by The University of Chicago.

Here, the relation between mean tract-based fractional anisotropy (mTBFA) and intelligence indices was explored. Deterministic tractography was performed using a regions of interest approach for 10 white-matter fascicles along which the mTBFA was calculated. The study sample included 83 healthy individuals from the second wave of the Cuban Human Brain Mapping Project, whose WAIS-III intelligence quotients and indices were obtained. Inspired by the “Watershed model” of intelligence, we employed a regularized hierarchical Multiple Indicator, Multiple Causes model (MIMIC), to assess the association of mTBFA with intelligence scores, as mediated by latent variables summarizing the indices. Regularized MIMIC, used due to the limited sample size, selected relevant mTBFA by means of an elastic net penalty and achieved good fits to the data. Two latent variables were necessary to describe the indices: Fluid intelligence (Perceptual Organization and Processing Speed indices) and Crystallized Intelligence (Verbal Comprehension and Working Memory indices). Regularized MIMIC revealed effects of the forceps minor tract on crystallized intelligence and of the superior longitudinal fasciculus on fluid intelligence. The model also detected the significant effect of age on both latent variables. © 2019 The Authors.

In our model, each brain region is assumed to have a binary behavior (active or not), the strengths of interactions among them are encoded in the anatomical connectivity matrix defined by the HC, and the dynamics of the system is defined by the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, working near the critical point of the network. We show that in the absence of direct external stimuli the BP algorithm converges to a spatial map of activations that is similar to the Default Mode Network (DMN) of the brain, which has been defined from the analysis of functional MRI data. Moreover, we use Susceptibility Propagation (SP) to compute the matrix of long-range correlations between the different regions and show that the modules defined by a clustering of this matrix resemble several Resting State Networks (RSN) determined experimentally. Both results suggest that the functional DMN and RSNs can be seen as simple consequences of the anatomical structure of the brain and a neural message-passing dynamics between macroscopic regions. With the new model, we explore predictions on how functional maps change when the anatomical brain network suffers structural alterations, like in Alzheimer's disease and in lesions of the Corpus Callosum. The implications and novel interpretations suggested by the model, as well as the role of criticality, are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","<b>An updated phylogenetic classification of Corynespora cassiicola isolates and a practical approach to their identification based on the nucleotide polymorphisms at the ga4 and caa5 loci<\/b><br><br>Corynespora cassiicola (Burk. & M.A. Curtis) C.T. Wei. is an anamorphic fungus that affects more than 530 plant species, including economically important crops. Several lineages of this pathogen have been recognized, but the classification of isolates into clades is time-consuming and still sometimes leads to unclear results. In this work, eight major phylogenetic clades (PhL1–PhL8) including 245 isolates of C. cassiicola from 44 plant species were established based on a Bayesian inference analysis of four combined C. cassiicola genomic loci retrieved from GenBank, i.e., rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS), actin-1,ga4, and caa5. The existence of PhL1–PhL5 and PhL7 as clonal lineages was further confirmed through the analysis of full-genome single-nucleotide polymorphisms of 39 isolates. Haplotypes of the caa5 locus were PhL specific and encode isoforms of the LDB19 domain of a putative α-arrestin N-terminal–like protein. Evolution of the Caa5 arrestin is in correspondence with the PhLs. ga4 and caa5 PhL consensus sequences and a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) procedure were generated based on the conserved nucleotide sequences and enzyme restriction patterns observed among isolates from the same lineage, respectively. The CAPS method was validated in silico, and its practical use allowed us to differentiate between tomato and papaya isolates, as well as to reveal the prevalence of PhL1 among isolates infecting soybean in Brazil. This novel approach could be useful in the efforts to control the diseases associated with C. cassiicola. © 2019, © 2019 The Mycological Society of America.","<b>Neural Model for the Prediction of Volume Losses in the Aging Process of Rums<\/b><br><br>The rum aging process shows volume losses, called wastage. The numerical operation variables: product, boardwalk, horizontal and vertical positions, date, volume, alcoholic degree, temperature, humidity and aging time, recorded in databases, contain valuable information to study the process. MATLAB 2017 software was used to estimate volume losses. In the modeling of the rum aging process, the multilayer perceptron neuronal network with one and two hidden layers was used, varying the number of neurons in these between 4 and 10. The Levenberg-Marquadt (LM) and Bayesian training algorithms were compared (Bay) The increase in 6 consecutive iterations of the validation error and 1,000 as the maximum number of training cycles were the criteria used to stop the training. The input variables to the network were: numerical month, volume, temperature, humidity, initial alcoholic degree and aging time, while the output variable was wastage. 546 pairs of input/output data were processed. The statistical Friedman and Wilcoxon tests were performed to select the best neural architecture according to the mean square error (MSE) criteria. The selected topology has a 6-4-4-1 structure, with an MSE of 2.1∙10-3 and a correlation factor (R) with experimental data of 0.9898. The neural network obtained was used to simulate thirteen initial aging conditions that were not used for training and validation, detecting a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9961. © 2020, Revista Facultad de Ingenieria.

Also, it achieved better performance than them. © 2020 Universidad de La Habana.

By using similarity relations as its underlying building blocks, IRBASIR is able to process datasets with both nominal and numerical features. In this paper we propose IRBASIR-Bayes, a modification to the IRBASIR method that relies on Bayesian Networks to construct the reference vector used to generate the rules.

The three parameter logistic (3P logistic) and the Richards models have been used to estimate primary epidemiological parameters in single dengue outbreak. A topic that could be of interest to epidemiologists is the comparison of two single dengue outbreaks based on estimates of key epidemiological parameters: The turning point, the final size and the basic reproductive number R0. In order to compare two single dengue outbreaks we create a model that takes into account both outbreaks simultaneously. In this paper, we describe different methodologies based on Frequentist and Bayesian approaches that takes into account the model uncertainty in the comparison of two single dengue outbreaks. The Frequentist approach consists of comparing outbreak doing an extension of 3P logistic and Richards models and the use of model averaging for taking into account model uncertainty. In the Bayesian approach, we use a Bayesian hierarchical model and we use Bayesian model averaging applying Gibbs variable selection. The proposed methods are applied to dengue outbreaks that occurred in La Lisa municipality, Havana City, Cuba during 2006 and 2007 outbreaks. © 2020 Universidad de La Habana.

Theory predicts symbionts like Wolbachia will be more common in species radiations, as host shift events occur with greatest frequency between closely related species. Further, the presence of Wolbachia itself may engender reproductive isolation, and promote speciation of their hosts. Here we screened 178 individuals belonging to 30 species of the damselfly genera Nesobasis and Melanesobasis — species radiations endemic to the Fiji archipelago in the South Pacific — for Wolbachia, using multilocus sequence typing to characterize bacterial strains. Incidence of Wolbachia was 71% in Nesobasis and 40% in Melanesobasis, and prevalence was also high, with an average of 88% in the Nesobasis species screened. We identified a total of 25 Wolbachia strains, belonging to supergroups A, B and F, with some epidemic strains present in multiple species. The occurrence of Wolbachia in both males and females, and the similar global prevalence found in both sexes rules out any strong effect of Wolbachia on the primary sex-ratio, but are compatible with the phenotype of cytoplasmic incompatibility. Nesobasis has higher species richness than most endemic island damselfly genera, and we discuss the potential for endosymbiont-mediated speciation within this group. © 2019, The Author(s).","<b>Advancing functional connectivity research from association to causation<\/b><br><br>Cognition and behavior emerge from brain network interactions, such that investigating causal interactions should be central to the study of brain function. Approaches that characterize statistical associations among neural time series—functional connectivity (FC) methods—are likely a good starting point for estimating brain network interactions. Yet only a subset of FC methods (‘effective connectivity’) is explicitly designed to infer causal interactions from statistical associations. Here we incorporate best practices from diverse areas of FC research to illustrate how FC methods can be refined to improve inferences about neural mechanisms, with properties of causal neural interactions as a common ontology to facilitate cumulative progress across FC approaches. We further demonstrate how the most common FC measures (correlation and coherence) reduce the set of likely causal models, facilitating causal inferences despite major limitations. Alternative FC measures are suggested to immediately start improving causal inferences beyond these common FC measures. © 2019, Springer Nature America, Inc.","<b>Comparative study of micronucleus assays and dicentric plus ring chromosomes for dose assessment in particular cases of partial-body exposure<\/b><br><br>Purpose: The goal was to compare the micronucleus (MN) and dicentric plus ring chromosomes (D + R) assays for dose assessment in cases of partial body irradiations (PBI). Materials and methods: We constructed calibration curves for each assay at doses ranging from 0 to 5 Gy of X-rays at dose rate of 0.275 Gy/min. To simulate partial-body exposures, blood samples from two donors were irradiated with 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 Gy and the ratios of irradiated to unirradiated blood were 25, 50, and 100%. Different tests were used to confirm if all samples were overdispersed or zero-inflated and for partial-body dose assessment we used the Qdr, Dolphin and Bayesian model. Results: In our samples for D + R calibration curve, practically all doses agreed with Poisson assumption, but MN exhibited overdispersed and zero-inflated cellular distributions. The exact Poisson tests and zero-inflated tests demonstrate that virtually all samples of D + R from PBI simulation fit the Poisson distribution and were not zero-inflated, but the MN samples were also overdispersed and zero-inflated. In the partial-body estimation, when Qdr and Dolphin methods were used the D + R results were better than MN, but the doses estimation defined by the Bayesian methodology were more accurate than the classical methods. Conclusions: Dicentric chromosomes continue to prove to be the best biological marker for dose assessment. However exposure scenarios of partial-body estimation, overdispersion and zero-inflation may not occur, it being a critical point not only for dose assessment, but also to confirm partial-body exposure. MN could be used as alternative assay for partial-body dose estimation, but in case of an accident without any information, the MN assay could not define whether the accident was a whole-body irradiation (WBI) or a PBI. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.","<b>The Statistics of EEG Unipolar References: Derivations and Properties<\/b><br><br>In this brief communication, which complements the EEG reference review (Yao et al. in Brain Topogr, 2019), we provide the mathematical derivations that show: (1) any EEG reference admits the general form of a linear transformation of the ideal multichannel EEG potentials with reference to infinity; (2) the average reference (AR), the reference electrode standardization technique (REST), and its regularized version (rREST) are solving the linear inverse problems that can be derived from both the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and the Bayesian theory; however, REST is based on more informative prior/constraint of volume conduction than that of AR; (3) we show for the first time that REST is also a unipolar reference (UR), allowing us to define a general family of URs with unified notations; (4) some notable properties of URs are ‘no memory’, ‘rank deficient by 1’, and ‘orthogonal projector centering’; (5) we also point out here, for the first time, that rREST provides the optimal interpolating function that can be used when the reference channel is missing or the ‘bad’ channels are rejected. The derivations and properties imply that: (a) any two URs can transform to each other and referencing with URs multiple times will not accumulate artifacts; (b) whatever URs the EEG data was previously transformed with, the minimum norm solution to the reference problem will be REST and AR with and without modeling volume conduction, respectively; (c) the MLE and the Bayesian theory show the theoretical optimality of REST. The advantages and limitations of AR and REST are discussed to guide readers for their proper use. © 2019, The Author(s).","<b>ERP Source Analysis Guided by fMRI During Familiar Face Processing<\/b><br><br>Event related potentials (ERPs) provide precise temporal information about cognitive processing, but with poor spatial resolution, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reliably identifies brain areas involved, but with poor temporal resolution. Here we use fMRI to guide source localization of the ERPs at different times for studying the temporal dynamics of the neural system for recognizing familiar faces. fMRI activation areas were defined in a previous experiment applying the same paradigm used for ERPs. The Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method was used to estimate the generators of the ERPs to unfamiliar, visually familiar, and personally-familiar faces constraining the model by fMRI activation results. For this, higher prior probabilities in the solution space were assigned to the fMRI-defined regions, which included face-selective areas and other areas related to “person knowledge” retrieval. Source analysis was carried out in three-time windows: early (150–210 ms), middle (300–380 ms) and late (460–580 ms). The early and middle responses were generated in fMRI-defined areas for all face categories, while these areas do not contribute to the late response. Different areas contributed to the generation of the early and middle ERPs elicited by unfamiliar faces: fusiform (Fus), inferior occipital, superior temporal sulcus and the posterior cingulate (PC) cortices. For familiar faces, the contributing areas were Fus, PC and anterior temporal areas for visually familiar faces, with the addition of the medial orbitofrontal areas and other frontal structures for personally-significant faces. For both unfamiliar and familiar faces, more extended and reliable involvement of contributing areas were obtained for the middle compare with early time window. Our fMRI guide ERP source analysis suggested the recruitment of person-knowledge processing areas as early as 150–210 ms after stimulus onset during recognition of personally-familiar faces. We concluded that fMRI-constrained BMA source analysis provide information regarding the temporal-dynamics in the neural system for cognitive processsing. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","<b>Approximate linear minimum variance filters for continuous-discrete state space models: Convergence and practical adaptive algorithms<\/b><br><br>In this article, approximate linear minimum variance (LMV) filters for continuous-discrete state space models are introduced. The filters are derived from a wide class of recursive approximations to the predictions for the first two conditional moments of the state equation between each pair of consecutive observations. The convergence of the approximate filters to the exact LMV filter is proved when the error between the predictions and their approximations decreases no matter the time distance between observations. As particular instance, the order-$\\beta$ local linearization filters are presented and expounded in detail. Practical adaptive algorithms are also provided and their performance in simulation is illustrated with various examples. The proposed filters are intended for the recurrent practical situation where a stochastic dynamical system should be identified from a reduced number of partial and noisy observations distant in time. © 2017 The authors.

The echoes caused by objectives that are not meteorological introduce errors in the information. Therefore, it is necessary to detect their presence before using this data. This paper presents four supervised classification techniques based on different models which seek to give an answer to this problem. In addition, as an important part of this work, resampling techniques were implemented on the training set in order to further asses the results. Resampling methods are an indispensable tool in modern statistics. Those techniques provide additional information about the model of interest by repeatedly drawing samples from then data. Based on data from a C-band Dual-PolarizationDoppler weather radar located in Anguil and from a previous expert's manual classification, four supervised classification methods with different degrees of flexibility in their structure were implemented: Lineal Model, Quadratic Model, Logistic Model and Bayes Naive Model. Finally, the results of each of them were assessed and compared. Although difficulties were encountered in classifying boundary zones between classes, the results obtained were adequate, showing the best performance in the least flexible model, the linear one. It is considered necessary to keep working in this line of research in order to include more cases in the analysis and allow a better inference on the results. © 2019 Centro Argentino de Meteorologos.","<b>The herophile species group of Calisto (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Satyrinae), new taxa and historical biogeography<\/b><br><br>The genus Calisto is endemic to the West Indies and the only representative there of the Satyrinae. Here we reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of the herophile group and describe five new species from Cuba: Calisto gundlachi sp. nov., Calisto siguanensis sp. nov., Calisto disjunctus sp. nov., Calisto sharkeyae sp. nov. and Calisto lastrai sp. nov. We employ one mitochondrial and four nuclear markers to assess the phylogenetic position, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference approaches, of the new taxa. Our phylogenetic trees yielded two strongly supported main clades with four of the new species included within them and C. sharkeyae as sister group to the rest of the major main clade. We conduct time-divergence estimations and ancestral area reconstructions using BEAST and BioGeoBEARS. The group originated 12.15 million years ago during the middle Miocene in north-eastern Cuba, Nipe-Sagua-Baracoa Massif. After 6 million years of in situ evolution most lineages started to colonise other Cuban territories and the Bahamas. This scenario is consistent with key geological events, including the closure of the western Havana-Matanzas channel 8-6 million years ago, the uplift of the Sierra Maestra 6-5 million years ago, and the land connections among Cuban regions during the Miocene-Pleistocene sea level drops. Dispersal and vicariance processes may have occurred, with populations surviving floodings on the major and minor mountain ranges, which remained as 'islands'. © 2019 CSIRO.","<b>A novel information criterion to elucidate a drug delivery mechanism from poly (acrylamide-co-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) reinforced with hydroxyapatite composite<\/b><br><br>Hydrophilic composites of poly (acrylamide-co-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) reinforced with hydroxyapatite were synthesized, characterized and evaluated as drug delivery systems. The results show a strong dependence of the polymer composition, the degree of crosslinking and the homogeneity of the particles dispersion (filler or the mixed drug) in the characteristics that were analyzed. The mechanical properties were better while the swelling and the diffusion coefficient were worse than hydrogels with cefazolin of similar compositions. A new information criterion based on Bayesian criteria was used to elucidate the best fit. The drug diffusion into the medium was anomalous with more tendency to diffusional transport, indicating that under certain conditions zero-order diffusion could be achieved. This fact suggests that these materials could be used in the manufacture of medical devices for the controlled delivery of drugs and active or biological principles, significantly improving therapeutic procedures today. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","<b>Multi-subject hierarchical inverse covariance modelling improves estimation of functional brain networks<\/b><br><br>A Bayesian model for sparse, hierarchical, inver-covariance estimation is presented, and applied to multi-subject functional connectivity estimation in the human brain. It enables simultaneous inference of the strength of connectivity between brain regions at both subject and population level, and is applicable to fMRI, MEG and EEG data. Two versions of the model can encourage sparse connectivity, either using continuous priors to suppress irrelevant connections, or using an explicit description of the network structure to estimate the connection probability between each pair of regions. A large evaluation of this model, and thirteen methods that represent the state of the art of inverse covariance modelling, is conducted using both simulated and resting-state functional imaging datasets. Our novel Bayesian approach has similar performance to the best extant alternative, Ng et al.'s Sparse Group Gaussian Graphical Model algorithm, which also is based on a hierarchical structure. Using data from the Human Connectome Project, we show that these hierarchical models are able to reduce the measurement error in MEG beta-band functional networks by 10%, producing concomitant increases in estimates of the genetic influence on functional connectivity. © 2018","<b>New insights on the taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships of the Neotropical genus Phoebis (Pieridae: Coliadinae) revealed by molecular and morphological data<\/b><br><br>Phoebis Hübner (1819) is a genus of the Neotropical subfamily Coliadinae (Lepidoptera: Pieridae). The highest diversity is found in the Greater Antilles islands in the Caribbean region. Although from the taxonomic point of view, Phoebis seems to be a stable genus, there is no phylogenetic hypothesis corroborating the monophyly of the genus. In this study, we used both morphological characters and a genetic dataset consisting of one mitochondrial (COI) and three nuclear markers (RpS5, MDH, Wingless). The matrix was concatenated and analysed with parsimony under implied weights (IW). Also, the concatenated data set was analysed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference evolutionary methods, and ancestral states reconstruction with characters traditionally used for classification of Phoebis was carried out. The same topology was recovered by Parsimony, ML and BI analysis, and suggest that Phoebis is not a monophyletic genus, with Aphrissa and Rhabdodryas nested within it. Our findings allow us to consider the genera Rhabdodryas syn.rev. and Aphrissa syn.rev. to be synonyms of Phoebis. These results have implications for the systematics of Phoebis and the genera that should be accepted in Coliadinae.

In the last decade, efforts have been made to develop a mathematical framework in order to image the effective sources of hemoglobin variations in brain tissues. Different approaches can be used to impose additional information or constraints when reconstructing the cerebral images of an ill-posed problem. The goal of this study is to compare the performance and limitations of several source localization techniques in the context of fNIRS tomography using individual anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to model light propagation. The forward problem is solved using a Monte Carlo simulation of light propagation in the tissues. The inverse problem has been linearized using the Rytov approximation. Then, Tikhonov regularization applied to least squares, truncated singular value decomposition, back-projection, L1-norm regularization, minimum norm estimates, low resolution electromagnetic tomography and Bayesian model averaging techniques are compared using a receiver operating characteristic analysis, blurring and localization error measures. Using realistic simulations (n = 450) and data acquired from a human participant, this study depicts how these source localization techniques behave in a human head fNIRS tomography. When compared to other methods, Bayesian model averaging is proposed as a promising method in DOT and shows great potential to improve specificity, accuracy, as well as to reduce blurring and localization error even in presence of noise and deep sources. Classical reconstruction methods, such as regularized least squares, offer better sensitivity but higher blurring; while more novel L1-based method provides sparse solutions with small blurring and high specificity but lower sensitivity. The application of these methods is also demonstrated experimentally using visual fNIRS experiment with adult participant. © 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.","<b>The diagnosis of diseases from the intelligent analysis of data<\/b><br><br>Medicine faces the challenge of acquiring, analyzing and applying knowledge to solve complex clinical problems.

Currently, both the average reference (AR) and the reference electrode standardization technique (REST) are two primary, apparently irreconcilable contenders. We propose a theoretical framework to resolve this reference issue by formulating both (a) estimation of potentials at infinity, and (b) determination of the reference, as a unified Bayesian linear inverse problem, which can be solved by maximum a posterior estimation. We find that AR and REST are very particular cases of this unified framework: AR results from biophysically non-informative prior; while REST utilizes the prior based on the EEG generative model. To allow for simultaneous denoising and reference estimation, we develop the regularized versions of AR and REST, named rAR and rREST, respectively. Both depend on a regularization parameter that is the noise to signal variance ratio. Traditional and new estimators are evaluated with this framework, by both simulations and analysis of real resting EEGs. Toward this end, we leverage the MRI and EEG data from 89 subjects which participated in the Cuban Human Brain Mapping Project. Generated artificial EEGs-with a known ground truth, show that relative error in estimating the EEG potentials at infinity is lowest for rREST. It also reveals that realistic volume conductor models improve the performances of REST and rREST. Importantly, for practical applications, it is shown that an average lead field gives the results comparable to the individual lead field. Finally, it is shown that the selection of the regularization parameter with Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) is close to the \"oracle\" choice based on the ground truth. When evaluated with the real 89 resting state EEGs, rREST consistently yields the lowest GCV. This study provides a novel perspective to the EEG reference problem by means of a unified inverse solution framework. It may allow additional principled theoretical formulations and numerical evaluation of performance. © 2018 Hu, Yao and Valdes-Sosa.","<b>Map representation using hidden markov models for mobile robot localization<\/b><br><br>This paper describes a map representation and localization system for a mobile robot based on Hidden Markov Models.

We experimentally induced stimulus familiarity via a systematic learning procedure including faces with and without associated verbal information. Then, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in both intra-domain (face-feature) and cross-domain (face-occupation) matching tasks while N400-like responses were elicited by incorrect eyes-eyebrows completions and occupations, respectively. A novel Bayesian source reconstruction approach plus conjunction analysis of group effects revealed that in both cases the generated N170s were of similar amplitude but had different neural origin. Thus, whereas the N170 of faces was associated predominantly to right fusiform and occipital regions (the so-called “Fusiform Face Area”, “FFA” and “Occipital Face Area”, “OFA”, respectively), the N170 of occupations was associated to a bilateral very posterior activity, suggestive of basic perceptual processes. Importantly, the right-sided perceptual P200 and the face-related N250 were evoked exclusively in the intra-domain task, with sources in OFA and extensively in the fusiform region, respectively. Regarding later latencies, the intra-domain N400 seemed to be generated in right posterior brain regions encompassing mainly OFA and, to some extent, the FFA, likely reflecting neural operations triggered by structural incongruities. In turn, the cross-domain N400 was related to more anterior left-sided fusiform and temporal inferior sources, paralleling those described previously for the classic verbal N400. These results support the existence of differentiated neural streams for face structure and person-related verbal processing triggered by faces, which can be activated differentially according to specific task demands. © 2018 Olivares, Lage-Castellanos, Bobes and Iglesias.","<b>Phylogenetic biogeography reveals the timing and source areas of the Adiantum species (Pteridaceae) in the West Indies, with a special focus on Cuba<\/b><br><br>Aim: The processes that shaped the West Indian fern flora remain poorly understood. We attempt to investigate earlier biogeographical patterns described for the region using the genus Adiantum as model. These patterns propose that the West Indian fern flora has (1) an essentially continental rather than insular character, having a rich representation of species occurring in tropical America; (2) the Greater Antilles have a higher fern diversity and higher endemism than the Lesser Antilles, and (3) adaptive speciation has been an important process in shaping the fern diversity of the Greater Antilles. Location: West Indies. Methods: Adiantum is a subcosmopolitan genus that comprises 200–225 species of which 33 occur in the West Indies. We compiled the most comprehensive molecular dataset of Adiantum available to date, including the chloroplast markers rbcL, atpA, atpB and trnL-F of 407 accessions belonging to 101 species, 24 of which occur in the West Indies. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference approaches were applied to generate phylogenetic hypotheses. Divergence times were estimated using published substitution rates. Ancestral areas were estimated using BioGeoBEARS. Results: The extant West Indian Adiantum species originate from at least 17 predominantly Miocene immigration events, 11 from South America and six from Central America, in combination with two cladogenetic events. The Cuban endemics Adiantum alomae and A. sericeum, as well as the Greater Antillean A. deltoideum, A. cristatum and A. pyramidale first appeared during the Pleistocene. The emergence of A. alomae and A. deltoideum coincides with the formation of the karstic relief of the Cuban coasts. Main conclusions: Immigration, rather than cladogenesis, governed the evolution of the West Indian Adiantum species. Our results concur with theoretical models proposed for island communities, suggesting that geologically younger and smaller island assemblages mainly derive from immigration, whereas cladogenesis plays an important role in older and larger islands. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","<b>Roselymyces, a new asexual genus of the xylariales (ascomycota) from Brazil<\/b><br><br>The new genus Roselymyces is established based on morphological and molecular analyses.

In the mathematical formulation, the accurate determination of the model parameters is an important step for the design of chromatographic conditions for continuous separation in SMB processes. This work is aimed at the estimation of the model parameters in adsorption processes, using a chromatographic column for the separation of glucose and fructose. The Bayesian framework for inverse problems is investigated through the implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) and a critical comparison against the classical Maximum Likelihood approach, with the minimization of the objective function via two different stochastic techniques, namely the Particle Collision Algorithm (PCA), and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is performed. Different cases are presented in order to investigate the statistical significance of the estimates obtained, and perform comparisons between the solution via Bayesian inference and via the minimization of the objective function with the stochastic methods. The results demonstrate that the Bayesian approach employs less computational effort to achieve estimates with comparable statistical information. © 2018, Scipedia S.L..

We fitted DCMs to high-density EEG data from subjects performing a semantic picture matching task. The subjects are carriers of the PSEN1 mutation, which leads to early onset Alzheimer's disease, but at the time of EEG acquisition in 1999, these subjects were cognitively unimpaired. We asked 1) what is the optimal model architecture for explaining the event-related potentials in this population, 2) which connections are different between this Presymptomatic Carrier (PreC) group and a Non-Carrier (NonC) group performing the same task, and 3) which network connections are predictive of subsequent Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) trajectories. We found 1) a model with hierarchical rather than lateral connections between hemispheres to be optimal, 2) that a pathway from right inferotemporal cortex (IT) to left medial temporal lobe (MTL) was preferentially activated by incongruent items for subjects in the PreC group but not the NonC group, and 3) that increased effective connectivity among left MTL, right IT, and right MTL was predictive of subsequent MMSE scores. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

The goal of this study was to explore the existence of short- and long-term survival populations and to assess the effect of immunotherapy on them. Methods: Data from two randomized, multicenter, controlled clinical trials was used to evaluate the effect of two therapeutic vaccines (anti-idiotypic vaccine VAXIRA and anti-EGF vaccine CIMAVAX) on survival curves in advanced non–small cell lung cancer patients. Data were fitted to Kaplan-Meier, standard Weibull survival, and two-component Weibull mixture models. Bayesian Information Criterion was used for model selection. Results: VAXIRA did not modify, neither the fraction of patients with long-term survivals (0.18 in the control group v 0.19 with VAXIRA, P =.88), nor the median overall survival of the patients in the short-term survival subpopulation (6.8 v 7.8 months, P =.24). However, this vaccine showed great benefit for the patients belonging to the subpopulation of patients with long-term survival (33.8 v 76.6 months, P <.0001). CIMAVAX showed impact in the overall survival of both short- and long-term populations (6.8 v 8.8 months, P =.005 and 33.8 v 61.8 months, P =.007). It also increased the proportion of patients with long-term survival (from 0.18 to 0.28, P =.02). Conclusions: This study shows that therapeutic vaccines produce differential effects on short- and long-term survival populations and illustrates the application of advanced statistical methods to deal with the long-term evolution of patients with advanced lung cancer in the era of immunotherapy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Fuzzy-Rough Cognitive Networks<\/b><br><br>Rough Cognitive Networks (RCNs) are a kind of granular neural network that augments the reasoning rule present in Fuzzy Cognitive Maps with crisp information granules coming from Rough Set Theory. While RCNs have shown promise in solving different classification problems, this model is still very sensitive to the similarity threshold upon which the rough information granules are built. In this paper, we cast the RCN model within the framework of fuzzy rough sets in an attempt to eliminate the need for a user-specified similarity threshold while retaining the model's discriminatory power. As far as we know, this is the first study that brings fuzzy sets into the domain of rough cognitive mapping. Numerical results in the presence of 140 well-known pattern classification problems reveal that our approach, referred to as Fuzzy-Rough Cognitive Networks, is capable of outperforming most traditional classifiers used for benchmarking purposes. Furthermore, we explore the impact of using different heterogeneous distance functions and fuzzy operators over the performance of our granular neural network. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","<b>Spatio temporal EEG source imaging with the hierarchical bayesian Elastic Net and Elitist Lasso models<\/b><br><br>The estimation of EEG generating sources constitutes an Inverse Problem (IP) in Neuroscience. This is an ill-posed problem due to the non-uniqueness of the solution and regularization or prior information is needed to undertake Electrophysiology Source Imaging. Structured Sparsity priors can be attained through combinations of (L1 norm-based) and (L2 norm-based) constraints such as the Elastic Net (ENET) and Elitist Lasso (ELASSO) models. The former model is used to find solutions with a small number of smooth nonzero patches, while the latter imposes different degrees of sparsity simultaneously along different dimensions of the spatio-temporal matrix solutions. Both models have been addressed within the penalized regression approach, where the regularization parameters are selected heuristically, leading usually to non-optimal and computationally expensive solutions. The existing Bayesian formulation of ENET allows hyperparameter learning, but using the computationally intensive Monte Carlo/Expectation Maximization methods, which makes impractical its application to the EEG IP. While the ELASSO have not been considered before into the Bayesian context. In this work, we attempt to solve the EEG IP using a Bayesian framework for ENET and ELASSO models. We propose a Structured Sparse Bayesian Learning algorithm based on combining the Empirical Bayes and the iterative coordinate descent procedures to estimate both the parameters and hyperparameters. Using realistic simulations and avoiding the inverse crime we illustrate that our methods are able to recover complicated source setups more accurately and with a more robust estimation of the hyperparameters and behavior under different sparsity scenarios than classical LORETA, ENET and LASSO Fusion solutions. We also solve the EEG IP using data from a visual attention experiment, finding more interpretable neurophysiological patterns with our methods.

The Center of Molecular Immunology created an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (CIMABior®), biosimilar of rituximab, which has been characterized from a biological point of view, but the safety and effectiveness are still being studied. Objective: Evaluate the safety and response to treatment, in patients with B-cell malignancies with compassionate use of CIMABior®. Methods: A multicenter, exploratory, non-controlled, non-randomized study was conducted with two variants of treatments (monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy). Adults with non-Hodgkin lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia not eligible for clinical trial with this product were included. Frequency of adverse events was calculated and those were characterized. The response to treatment was defined as: complete response, partial response, stable disease or progressive disease. Overall response rate (complete plus partial remission) was calculated with 95% confidence interval. The relation of some variables with response was estimated per Odss ratio. As a measure of the benefit-risk balance, the Bayes factor was estimated. Results: The more frequent adverse events were: tremors (12.8%) and fever (10.3%). Those related to the product (43.4%) were minor and evolved to recovery. There were no deaths in reference to the treatment. An overall response of 71.2% was confirmed (59.6% complete remissions and 11.5% partial remission). The monotherapy group objective response was 66.7% and 73.0% in the CIMABior® plus chemotherapy group, with complete remissions of 46.7% and 64.9% respectively. Conclusions: The monoclonal antibodies CIMABor® is safe, well tolerated and evidences of its effectiveness was demonstrated. The treatment provided a superior clinical benefit to the risk of developing a severe adverse event. © 2017 Revista Cubana de Hematología, Inmunología y Hemoterapia.","<b>Multiple robustness in factorized likelihood models<\/b><br><br>We consider inference under a nonparametric or semiparametric model with likelihood that factorizes as the product of two or more variation-independent factors.We are interested in a finitedimensional parameter that depends on only one of the likelihood factors and whose estimation requires the auxiliary estimation of one or several nuisance functions.

This group was once considered rare, but now 45 described species can be characterized, among others, by their paired, segmental copulatory organs (one to multiple external pairs), which display a complexity of various accessory structures. The evolutionary significance of these unique organs was suggested in the late 1960s, but has been heavily debated since the late 1990s and remains controversial. In the present paper, we study the internal relationships within Pisione, employing combined phylogenetic analyses of both molecular and morphological data from 16 terminals of Pisione, as well as two terminals of Pisionidens, and eight additional scale worms as outgroups. Our taxon sampling covers all geographical areas where the genus has been reported, as well as most of their morphological and copulatory variability, including representatives of the “africana,” “remota,” “crassa,” and “papuensis” groups, established previously by Yamanishi. We hereby provide a first insight into the relationships of the genus, testing previously proposed hypotheses on the evolutionary significance of male copulatory structures within Pisione, while attempting to understand patterns of distribution. The phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods consistently recovered two large clades spanning the East Atlantic (including the Mediterranean) and the Indo-Pacific–West Atlantic, respectively. Character optimization on our trees revealed a high degree of homoplasy in both non-reproductive and sexual characters of Pisione, with buccal acicula found to be the sole apomorphy among the morphological features assessed herein, with none defining the biogeographical subclades within. Overall, our comparative analyses highlight the high degree of morphological variation in this widely distributed genus, rejecting previous assertions of an increasing number and complexity of copulatory structures across the genus. © 2017 The Authors.

The kind of message passing algorithm used for CVM, usually named generalized belief propagation (GBP), is a generalization of the belief propagation algorithm in the same way that CVM is a generalization of the Bethe approximation for estimating the partition function. However, the connection between fixed points of GBP and the extremal points of the CVM free energy is usually not a one-to-one correspondence because of the existence of a gauge transformation involving the GBP messages. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose a way of defining messages (fields) in a generic CVM approximation, such that messages arrive on a given region from all its ancestors, and not only from its direct parents, as in the standard parent-to-child GBP. We call this approach maximal messages. Second, we focus on the case of binary variables, reinterpreting the messages as fields enforcing the consistency between the moments of the local (marginal) probability distributions. We provide a precise rule to enforce all consistencies, avoiding any redundancy, that would otherwise lead to a gauge transformation on the messages. This moment matching method is gauge free, i.e., it guarantees that the resulting GBP is not gauge invariant. We apply our maximal messages and moment matching GBP to obtain an analytical expression for the critical temperature of the Ising model in general dimensions at the level of plaquette CVM. The values obtained outperform Bethe estimates, and are comparable with loop corrected belief propagation equations. The method allows for a straightforward generalization to disordered systems. © 2017 American Physical Society.","<b>Origin and evolutionary history of HIV-1 subtype B in Cuba<\/b><br><br>INTRODUCTION: Cuba's HIV epidemic is characterized by high genetic diversity, with circulation of several subtypes and recombinant forms. Earlier studies described a predominance of subtype B in the HIV-positive population, but these studies did not take into account patients' epidemiologic history. OBJECTIVE: Clarify the origin and phylodynamics of HIV-1 subtype B in the Cuban epidemic. METHODS: We analysed phylogenetic relationships among 120 sequences (from different geographic origins) of the pol gene in HIV-1 subtype B isolates from Cuban patients diagnosed from 1987 through 2012. Time of HIV-1 subtype B introduction and viral evolutionary rate were determined using a Bayesian coalescent method. RESULTS: Based on phylogenetic relationships, subtype B was introduced into Cuba multiple times. Subtype B spread in Cuba through dissemination of strains that probably came from the USA, Canada and Europe. The time of the most recent common ancestor of Cuban subtype B was close to 1977 (95% CI 1974-1982), and the evolutionary rate was 2.7 × 10-3 nucleotide substitutions per site per year. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest multiple introductions of HIV-1B into Cuba in the late 1970s, predominantly strains from North America and Europe. The results reflect the importance of maintaining, reviewing and updating molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in Cuba, due to its rapid evolution and possible implications for the National STI/HIV/AIDS Program of Cuba's Ministry of Public Health.","<b>Phylogenetic relationships of two Cuban spleenworts with unusual morphology: Asplenium (Schaffneria) nigripes and Asplenium pumilum (Aspleniaceae, leptosporangiate ferns)<\/b><br><br>The infrageneric classification of Asplenium, the most species-rich genus of ferns, is notoriously difficult as a result of extensive morphological homoplasy combined with exceptional morphological disparity. Besides a core Asplenium, 29 satellite genera have been described, but most of them have not been widely accepted. In recent years, molecular phylogenetic studies found most of these satellite genera to be nested in Asplenium, but several morphologically distinct taxa have not yet been included in such studies. One of these elements is the monospecific neotropical genus Schaffneria which is characterized by undivided suborbicular blades, lack of a costa, black stipes, netted veins and single or paired sori. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic inference based on the chloroplast DNA markers rbcL, rps4, rps4-trnS and trnL-trnF indicated a position of Schaffneria nigripes within Asplenium. We thus propose to treat Schaffneria as a synonym of Asplenium and adopt the name Asplenium nigripes. With the current sampling, Asplenium (Schaffneria) nigripes is placed sister to A. pumilum, the only species of Asplenium with whitish catenate hairs on its leaves. Despite considerable morphological differences, both species resemble each other in several features including filiform-lanceolate, mostly entire, brown-blackish rhizome scales with a dark-sclerotic center and some marginal projections, a striate, hairy epidermis, echinolophate spore ornamentation with slim microechinate folds forming small lacunae, and Aspidium-type gametophytes. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.","<b>Tracking the Origin and Deciphering the Phylogenetic Relationship of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus in Ecuador<\/b><br><br>In 2010, new Chinese strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), clinically more severe than the classical strains, emerged. These strains were spread to United States in 2013 through an intercontinental transmission from China with further spreading across the world, evidencing the emergent nature of these strains. In the present study, an analysis of PEDV field sequences from Ecuador was conducted by comparing all the PEDV S gene sequences available in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic comparisons and Bayesian phylogeographic inference based on complete S gene sequences were also conducted to track the origin and putative route of PEDV. The sequence from the PED-outbreak in Ecuador was grouped into the clade II of PEDV genogroup 2a together with other sequences of isolates from Mexico, Canada, and United States. The phylogeographic study revealed the emergence of the Chinese PEDV strains, followed by spreading to US in 2013, from US to Korea, and later the introduction of PEDV to Canada, Mexico, and Ecuador directly from the US. The sources of imports of live swine in Ecuador in 2014 were mainly from Chile and US. Thus, this movement of pigs is suggested as the main way for introducing PEDV to Ecuador. © 2017 Maritza Barrera et al.","<b>Taxonomic reassessment of species within the chrysaoros group of Calisto (Lepidoptera:Nymphalidae:Satyrinae)<\/b><br><br>The taxonomic status of the Hispaniolan species of Calisto Hübner, 1823 included in the chrysaoros group is reassessed. Morphological data and COI barcode sequences were analysed through different methods: Neighbour-Joining clustering, ABGD, Median-Joining Haplotype Network, Maximum Likelihood, and Bayesian Inference. Analyses yielded two deeply separated groups or putative species: C. clydoniata and C. chrysaoros. A shallower split was found, except in the Bayesian Inference approach, among populations of southern and northern Hispaniola palaeo-islands. In light of these findings we propose the recognition of two species: C. clydoniata and C. chrysaoros. Within the latter, the populations of the southern and northern Hispaniola palaeo-islands should be recognised as different subspecies: C. chrysaoros chrysaoros Bates and C. chrysaoros galii Schwartz, respectively. Calisto clenchi, syn. nov. is a synonym of C. chrysaoros chrysaoros whereas C. galii galli, syn. nov. and C. galii choneupsilon, syn. nov. are synonyms of C. chrysaoros galii. © CSIRO 2017.","<b>Morphology and COI barcodes reveal four new species in the lycieus group of Calisto (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae, Satyrinae)<\/b><br><br>The predominantly Greater Antillean endemic genus Calisto Hübner, 1823 is highly diversified on several islands being more species rich on Hispaniola. We conducted expeditions during five years in the Dominican Republic resulting in new findings related with lyceius species group. Material belonging to this group was examined following the traditional morphological characters employed in genus taxonomy, and the COI barcode sequences obtained were analyzed through different approaches: Neighbor Joining clustering, ABGD, Maximum Likelihood (ML), and Bayesian Inference (BI). Analysis yielded 12 groups representing putative species: eight corresponding to previously named ones and four new species which are described in the present work: C. mariposa sp. nov., C. azua sp. nov., C. victori sp. nov., and C. Samana sp. nov. The results also confirmed a single taxonomic entity within C. pulchella Lathy and the conspecific nature of C. franciscoi Gali and C. hendersoni. A dichotomic key for identification of species within the group is also given. Both phylogenetic reconstruction methods (ML and BI) employing molecular data achieved similar results with the relationships among the majority of taxa being supported by some ecological and morphological features. The exceptions were C. zangis Fabricius, C. raburni Gali, and C. pulchella, grouped together in a weakly supported clade.

This lineage of flowering plants constitutes an important component of the flora of the Caribbean islands with many endemics. Furthermore, because it is also diverse in adjacent Mexico, Mesoamerica and South America, it allows a representative analysis of possible migration routes into the Caribbean. Location: Neotropics, Cuba, Hispaniola and the Caribbean region, Mexico and Mesoamerica. Methods: We generated a well-resolved and dated phylogenetic hypothesis based on a dense sampling, in particular of the New World taxa but also representing all remaining Acalyphoideae, and combined datasets of chloroplast spacers and introns. Bayesian divergence-time estimation was applied to determine node ages. Ancestral states of distributional areas were reconstructed in a Bayesian framework to determine the geographical origin of the Caribbean ancestors. Results: A Neotropical clade started to diversify 59.29 [50.41–68.44 95% highest posterior density (HPD)] Ma within the Acalyphoideae. The Caribbean islands then were reached several times independently from the Miocene onwards. The exclusively Caribbean Leucocroton–Lasiocroton–Garciadelia [9.1 (6.3–12.3 95% HPD) Ma] and Acidoton–Platygyna [9.3 (5.2–15.4 95% HPD) Ma] clades exhibit one of the most successful plant radiations in the region, and Caribbean subclades of Acalypha and Bernardia just date back to the Pliocene and Pleistocene, respectively. Main conclusions: Our data show that Mexico and Mesoamerica have played a key role as a source for today's Caribbean Acalyphoideae. Their ancestors arrived from the mainland to the Caribbean islands during the Miocene when Caribbean land masses were completely separated and then diversified in situ. We postulate long-distance dispersal to have played a major role for colonizing the Caribbean. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","<b>Increasing clinical severity during a dengue virus type 3 Cuban epidemic: Deep sequencing of evolving viral populations<\/b><br><br>During the dengue virus type 3 (DENV-3) epidemic that occurred in Havana in 2001 to 2002, severe disease was associated with the infection sequence DENV-1 followed by DENV-3 (DENV-1/DENV-3), while the sequence DENV-2/DENV-3 was associated with mild/asymptomatic infections. To determine the role of the virus in the increasing severity demonstrated during the epidemic, serum samples collected at different time points were studied. A total of 22 full-length sequences were obtained using a deep-sequencing approach. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of consensus sequences revealed that two DENV-3 lineages were circulating in Havana at that time, both grouped within genotype III. The predominant lineage is closely related to Peruvian and Ecuadorian strains, while the minor lineage is related to Venezuelan strains. According to consensus sequences, relatively few nonsynonymous mutations were observed; only one was fixed during the epidemic at position 4380 in the NS2B gene. Intrahost genetic analysis indicated that a significant minor population was selected and became predominant toward the end of the epidemic. In conclusion, greater variability was detected during the epidemic's progression in terms of significant minority variants, particularly in the nonstructural genes. An increasing trend of genetic diversity toward the end of the epidemic was observed only for synonymous variant allele rates, with higher variability in secondary cases. Remarkably, significant intrahost genetic variation was demonstrated within the same patient during the course of secondary infection with DENV-1/DENV-3, including changes in the structural proteins premembrane (PrM) and envelope (E). Therefore, the dynamic of evolving viral populations in the context of heterotypic antibodies could be related to the increasing clinical severity observed during the epidemic. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

However, one species, L. dentata, has a wide but disjointed distribution over 300 km in the west of the island. In order to estimate the relative role of vicariance and dispersal in the unexpected L. dentata distribution, we obtained partial sequences of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b (cytb) gene and control region (CR), and then applied Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), based on the identification of five genetic and geographic congruent groups of populations. The process that best explains the distribution of genetic diversity in this species is sequential range expansion from east Matanzas to the western Pinar del Río provinces, followed by isolation of groups of populations. We found relative high haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity in all but the Havana group, which has high values for both diversity parameters, suggesting that this group has been demographically stable over time. For two groups of populations (Cayuco and Bolondrón), the mismatch distribution analyses suggests past demographic expansion. In the case of the Cayuco region, the star like relationships of haplotypes in the network suggests a recent founding event, congruent with other evidence indicating that this is the most recently colonized region. Over all, the results suggest that a combination of habitat availability, temporal interconnections, and possibly the biological properties of this species, may have enabled its dispersal and range expansion compared to other species of the genus, which are more geographically restricted. © 2016 Hernández et al.

BRGNN was applied to the computer-aided design of drug candidates for a variety of diseases, that is, cancer, AIDS, fungal infections, cardiac disease, etc. The neural networks were successfully trained to calculate the biological activities of a wide spectrum of drug candidates using different levels of representation of the chemical information. 2D and 3D structural descriptors were more frequently used, but quantum chemical descriptors also yielded good neural network models.

Tropical raptors are generally rare species. The scarce information on distribution patterns of rare species makes it difficult to establish reliable conservation plans. We used ecological niche modelling to obtain good predictions of occurrence of two case species, the rare and endemic Gundlach's and Cuban Black-hawks in Cuba, based on presence-only data. We used records from an intensive survey undertaken in natural and modified environments. Data were integrated with environmental variables using Maxent to predict species distributions. Subsequently, we overlaid the resulting predicted distributions, the land use map and the protected areas layers to establish potential suitable habitat for these endemics and to determine if a better design of protected areas than the existing one can be proposed using both hawks' distribution in the design. Gundlach's Hawk distribution was fragmented, depending on forest distribution. Cuban Black-Hawk distribution was narrow, near the coastline. Forests and mangrove represent 57% and 45% of Gundlach's Hawk and Cuban Black-Hawk model predictions, respectively. 71% of the total forest area was represented in the distribution of Gundlach's Hawk. Mangrove area overlaps 45% of the Cuban Black-Hawk distribution. Six protected areas preserved 50% and 92% of their distributions, respectively. With few presence-only data of rare species, Maxent models were statistically and ecologically significant and reliable to develop distribution maps with high predictive power. Our results highlight the importance of natural habitats for conservation efforts of these endemic species. A good conservation program should include the protection of suitable nesting areas and expand the protected areas network containing suitable habitats for both species in forest and coastal areas. We propose the use of predictive modelling tools to strengthen conservation actions not only for rare raptors but for the 238 endemic and threatened birds of the Neotropics with scarce data, small population sizes, restricted distributions and often specialist habits. © 2015 The Authors.","<b>Multi-criteria decision making: The best choice for the modeling of chemicals against hyper-pigmentation?<\/b><br><br>Classifier ensembles appeared to be powerful alternative for handling a difficult problem. It is rapidly growing and enjoying many attentions from pattern recognition and machine learning communities. In the present report, the potential of multi-criteria decision making via multiclassifier approaches is assessed by applying them in the modeling of chemicals against hyper-pigmentation. TOMOCOMD-CARDD atom-based quadratic indices are used as descriptors to parameterize the molecular structures. Support vector machine, artificial neural network, Bayesian network, binary logistic regression, instance-based learning and tree classification applied on two collected datasets are explored as standalone classifiers. Prediction sets (PSs) are used to assess the performance of multiclassifier systems (MCSs). A strategy exploiting the principal component analysis together with pairwise diversity measures is designed to select the most diverse base classifiers to combine. Various trainable and nontrainable systems are developed that aggregate, at the abstract and continuous levels, the outputs of base classifiers. The obtained results are rather encouraging since the MCSs generally enhance the performance of the base classifiers; e.g. the best MCS obtains global accuracy of 95.51%, 88.89% in the PS for the data I and II in regard to 94.12% and 85.93% of best individual classifier, respectively. Our results suggest that the MCSs could be the best choice till the moment to obtain suitable QSAR models for the prediction of depigmenting agents. Finally, we consider these approaches will aid improving the virtual screening procedures and increasing the practicality of data mining of chemical datasets for the discovery of novel lead compounds. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.","<b>Tensor Analysis and Fusion of Multimodal Brain Images<\/b><br><br>Current high-throughput data acquisition technologies probe dynamical systems with different imaging modalities, generating massive data sets at different spatial and temporal resolutions-posing challenging problems in multimodal data fusion. A case in point is the attempt to parse out the brain structures and networks that underpin human cognitive processes by analysis of different neuroimaging modalities (functional MRI, EEG, NIRS, etc.). We emphasize that the multimodal, multiscale nature of neuroimaging data is well reflected by a multiway (tensor) structure where the underlying processes can be summarized by a relatively small number of components or 'atoms.' We introduce Markov-Penrose diagrams-an integration of Bayesian DAG and tensor network notation in order to analyze these models. These diagrams not only clarify matrix and tensor EEG and fMRI time/frequency analysis and inverse problems, but also help understand multimodal fusion via multiway partial least squares and coupled matrix-tensor factorization. We show here, for the first time, that Granger causal analysis of brain networks is a tensor regression problem, thus allowing the atomic decomposition of brain networks.

NCS-1 is a multispecific protein interacting with a number of binding partners in both calcium-dependent and independent manners, and acting in a variety of cellular processes in which it has been linked to a number of disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. Despite extensive studies on the Ca2+-activated state of NCS proteins, little is known about the conformational dynamics of the Mg2+-bound and apo states, both of which are populated, at least transiently, at resting Ca2+ conditions. Here, we used optical tweezers to study the folding behavior of individual NCS-1 molecules in the presence of Mg2+ and in the absence of divalent ions. Under tension, the Mg2+-bound state of NCS-1 unfolds and refolds in a three-state process by populating one intermediate state consisting of a folded C-domain and an unfolded N-domain. The interconversion at equilibrium between the different molecular states populated by NCS-1 was monitored in real time through constant-force measurements and the energy landscapes underlying the observed transitions were reconstructed through hidden Markov model analysis. Unlike what has been observed with the Ca2+-bound state, the presence of Mg2+ allows both the N- and C-domain to fold through all-or-none transitions with similar refolding rates. In the absence of divalent ions, NCS-1 unfolds and refolds reversibly in a two-state reaction involving only the C-domain, whereas the N-domain has no detectable transitions. Overall, the results allowed us to trace the progression of NCS-1 folding along its energy landscapes and provided a solid platform for understanding the conformational dynamics of similar EF-hand proteins. © 2015 Biophysical Society.","<b>Evaluation of a phylogenetic marker based on genomic segment B of infectious bursal disease virus: Facilitating a feasible incorporation of this segment to the molecular epidemiology studies for this viral agent<\/b><br><br>Background: Infectious bursal disease (IBD) is a highly contagious and acute viral disease, which has caused high mortality rates in birds and considerable economic losses in different parts of the world for more than two decades and it still represents a considerable threat to poultry. The current study was designed to rigorously measure the reliability of a phylogenetic marker included into segment B. This marker can facilitate molecular epidemiology studies, incorporating this segment of the viral genome, to better explain the links between emergence, spreading and maintenance of the very virulent IBD virus (vvIBDV) strains worldwide. Methodology/Principal Findings: Sequences of the segment B gene from IBDV strains isolated from diverse geographic locations were obtained from the GenBank Database; Cuban sequences were obtained in the current work. A phylogenetic marker named B-marker was assessed by different phylogenetic principles such as saturation of substitution, phylogenetic noise and high consistency. This last parameter is based on the ability of B-marker to reconstruct the same topology as the complete segment B of the viral genome. From the results obtained from B-marker, demographic history for both main lineages of IBDV regarding segment B was performed by Bayesian skyline plot analysis. Phylogenetic analysis for both segments of IBDV genome was also performed, revealing the presence of a natural reassortant strain with segment A from vvIBDV strains and segment B from non-vvIBDV strains within Cuban IBDV population. Conclusions/Significance: This study contributes to a better understanding of the emergence of vvIBDV strains, describing molecular epidemiology of IBDV using the state-of-the-art methodology concerning phylogenetic reconstruction. This study also revealed the presence of a novel natural reassorted strain as possible manifest of change in the genetic structure and stability of the vvIBDV strains. Therefore, it highlights the need to obtain information about both genome segments of IBDV for molecular epidemiology studies. © 2015 Alfonso-Morales et al.","<b>Improving electroencephalographic source localization of epileptogenic zones with time-frequency analysis<\/b><br><br>The combination of recently developed methods for electroencephalographic (EEG) space-time-frequency analysis can provide noninvasive functional neuroimages necessary for obtaining an accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone. The aim of this study was to determine if time-frequency (TF) analysis, followed by EEG source localization, would improve the detection and identification of epileptogenic and related activity. Seventeen patients with refractory frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) were studied using video EEG recording. TF analysis identified the first epileptogenic EEG changes. Using the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach, we compared brain electromagnetic tomographic (BET) images, constructed from the TF domain, with BET images constructed from the time domain only. We determined if the localization identified by BET images was concordant with the localization from medical history and video EEG recording. TF analysis provided a clear display of subtle EEG features, including EEG lateralization, and more concordant and delimited epileptogenic zones, compared with time-domain source analysis. In conclusion, EEG TF analysis improves source localization. After a thorough validation, this methodology could become a useful noninvasive tool for localizing the epileptogenic zone in clinical practice. © EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ECNS) 2014.","<b>Neural network approach for T-wave end detection: A comparison of architectures<\/b><br><br>In this paper, a new approach to the problem of detecting the end of the T wave (Te) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks is proposed and evaluated. The approach consists of a neural network acting as a regression function that estimates the Te location using the samples between two consecutive R peaks. The input vectors were taken using three dimensional reduction methods (Discrete Cosine Transform, DCT, Principal Component Analysis, PCA and resampling, RES) over a window of 100 samples. For training, Bayesian regularization has been used. A total of 1536 neural networks were trained. The results show that PCA and DCT are more feasible than RES as dimension reduction methods.

Cuban Amazon parrots (Amazona leucocephala) are considered vulnerable, and multiple on-island captive populations have been established from wild-caught and confiscated individuals of unknown ancestry. Here, we used mitochondrial haplotypic and nuclear genotypic data at 9 microsatellite loci to quantify the extent and distribution of genetic variation within and among captive populations in Zapata Swamp and Managua, Cuba, and to estimate kinship among breeders (n = 88). Using Bayesian clustering analysis, we detected 2 distinct clusters within the Zapata population, one of which was shared with Managua. Individuals from the cluster unique to Zapata possessed mitochondrial haplotypes with affinities to Cuban subspecies (A. l. leucocephala, A. l. palmarum); the shared cluster was similar, but also included haplotypes closely related to the subspecies restricted to Cayman Brac (A. l. hesterna). Overall mean kinship was low within each captive population (-0.026 to -0.012), with 19 and 11 recommended breeding pairs in Zapata and Managua, respectively, ranked according to mean kinship and informed by molecular sexing. Our results highlight the importance of understanding population history within ex situ management programs, while providing genetic information to directly inform Cuban parrot conservation. © 2015 The American Genetic Association 2015.

In this study, we model distribution and map species richness of the 40 amphibian species from eastern Cuba with the objectives of identify hotspots, detect gaps in species representation in protected areas, and select additional areas to fill these gaps. We used two modeling methods, Maxent and Habitat Suitability Models, to reach a consensus distribution map for each species, then calculate species richness by combining specific models and finally performed gap analyses for species and hotspots. Our results showed that the models were robust enough to predict species distributions and that most of the amphibian hotspots were represented in reserves, but 50 percent of the species were incompletely covered and Eleutherodactylus rivularis was totally uncovered by the protected areas. We identified 1441 additional km2 (9.9% of the study area) that could be added to the current protected areas, allowing the representation of every species and all hotspots. Our results are relevant for the conservation planning in other Caribbean islands, since studies like this could contribute to fill the gaps in the existing protected areas and to design a future network. Both cases would benefit from modeling amphibian species distribution using available data, even if they are incomplete, rather than relying only in the protection of known or suspected hotspots. © 2014 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.","<b>Bayesian analysis of external corrosion data of non-piggable underground pipelines<\/b><br><br>A new Bayesian methodology for the analysis of external corrosion data of non-piggable underground pipelines has been developed.

We have studied an unselected population with advanced lung cancer to look for evidence of multimodality in survival distribution, and estimate the proportion of long-term survivors. Methods: We used survival data of 4944 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stages IIIb-IV at diagnostic, registered in the National Cancer Registry of Cuba (NCRC) between January 1998 and December 2006. We fitted one-component survival model and two-component mixture models to identify short- and long- term survivors. Bayesian information criterion was used for model selection. Results: For all of the selected parametric distributions the two components model presented the best fit. The population with short-term survival (almost 4 months median survival) represented 64% of patients. The population of long-term survival included 35% of patients, and showed a median survival around 12 months. None of the patients of short-term survival was still alive at month 24, while 10% of the patients of long-term survival died afterwards. Conclusions: There is a subgroup showing long-term evolution among patients with advanced lung cancer. As survival rates continue to improve with the new generation of therapies, prognostic models considering short- and long-term survival subpopulations should be considered in clinical research. © 2014 Sanchez et al.","<b>Some considerations on the back door theorem and conditional randomization<\/b><br><br>In this work, we propose a different \"surgical modified model\" for the construction of counterfactual variables under non-parametric structural equation models.

However, the dengue epidemic that occurred in Cuba in 1981 was the first laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed outbreak of dengue haemorrhagic fever in the Americas. At that time, the presumed source of the dengue type 2 strain isolated during this epidemic was considered controversial, partly because of the limited sequence data and partly because the origin of the virus appeared to be southern Asia. Here, we present a molecular characterisation at the whole-genome level of the original strains isolated at different time points during the epidemic. Phylogenetic trees constructed using Bayesian methods indicated that 1981 Cuban strains group within the Asian 2 genotype. In addition, the study revealed that viral evolution occurred during the epidemic – a fact that could be related to the increasing severity from month to month. Moreover, the Cuban strains exhibited particular amino acid substitutions that differentiate them from the New Guinea C prototype strain as well as from dengue type 2 strains isolated globally. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.","<b>Phylogeography of Cuban Rivulus: Evidence for allopatric speciation and secondary dispersal across a marine barrier<\/b><br><br>The genus Rivulus is currently comprised of two species, R. cylindraceus and R. insulaepinorum, which are endemic to Cuba. However, the taxonomic status of the latter species remains dubious because of the poor quality of the original description. In addition, a recent barcoding survey suggests that the two species may be conspecific. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the two species represent a single evolutionary clade. To delimit the species and their evolutionary history, we used a combination of molecular phylogenetic analyses, with both mitochondrial and nuclear sequences, tests of phylogeographic hypotheses, combined with morphological measurements and information on known dispersal barriers and species distribution. None of the data sets support R. insulaepinorum and R. cylindraceus as separate taxa. However, a new species, restricted to the northwestern part of the main island, was identified by phylogenetic analyses, body colour pattern and geographical distribution. The evolutionary distance between the two lineages (. cytb, d=. 15%; CAM-4, d=. 2.5%) indicates a long period of divergence. Phylogeographic analyses shed light on the dispersal history of R. cylindraceus, which probably originated on the Isla de la Juventud. They also suggest that each lineage had contrasting histories; Rivulus sp. is restricted to a relatively small geographic area whereas R. cylindraceus has dispersed considerably and more than once from its centre of origin, probably facilitated by sea level fluctuations. These results strengthen previous findings, i.e. that the diversity of Cuban freshwater fishes is far from well-known and deserves more in-depth studies, and that vicariance and dispersal events have resulted in a complex biogeographical landscape which has had a significant impact on the freshwater fishes of the Caribbean islands. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","<b>A phylogeny of the Gochnatieae: Understanding a critically placed tribe in the Compositae<\/b><br><br>Subfamily Gochnatioideae is the sister group of ~96% of the species in Compositae (Asteraceae). It is of particular interest not only because of its position in the phylogeny, but also because, in recent molecular studies, the node it occupies is not strongly supported making difficult any inferences on the direction of character evolution in the family. The recognition of tribe Gochnatieae was one of the results of a comprehensive molecular analysis of the family that showed the traditional circumscription of the Mutisieae to be non-monophyletic. The four genera of Gochnatieae (Cnicothamnus, Cyclolepis, Gochnatia, Richterago) were defined by the presence of apiculate anther appendages and dorsally smooth style branches. Gochnatia, which contained about 70 species, was the largest and most complex genus and in the last decade some of its sections have been moved (or returned) to the rank of genus. This study includes a large selection of potential outgroups and over 60% of all species in the tribe, including all the genera and all but one of the sections of Gochnatia, to examine evolutionary relationships among the taxa. Both cpDNA and nrDNA were used in a phylogenetic analysis using parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian approaches. The results suggest a non-monophyletic Gochnatia that is here resolved by the recognition of segregate genera. Morphological characters support these new genera and allow the adoption of a new classification for the Gochnatieae. A biogeographic analysis shows a possible southern South American/Andean origin followed by movement in three directions: into the Central Andes, into central and northern Brazil, and into Mexico and the Caribbean. The dating analysis gives an age of the split of the core Gochnatieae from the Wunderlichieae-Cyclolepis clade, and hence the age of the tribe, of 36-45 Ma and an age of 23-25 Ma for the first split within the core Gochnatieae (Andean vs. Brazil-Mexico-Caribbean). Cnicothamnus remains in Gochnatieae but Cyclolepis is designated incertae sedis. © International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) 2014.","<b>A formal model of interpersonal inference<\/b><br><br>Introduction: We propose that active Bayesian inference-a general framework for decision-making-can equally be applied to interpersonal exchanges. Social cognition, however, entails special challenges. We address these challenges through a novel formulation of a formal model and demonstrate its psychological significance. Method: We review relevant literature, especially with regards to interpersonal representations, formulate a mathematical model and present a simulation study. The model accommodates normative models from utility theory and places them within the broader setting of Bayesian inference. Crucially, we endow people's prior beliefs, into which utilities are absorbed, with preferences of self and others. The simulation illustrates the model's dynamics and furnishes elementary predictions of the theory. Results: (1) Because beliefs about self and others inform both the desirability and plausibility of outcomes, in this framework interpersonal representations become beliefs that have to be actively inferred. This inference, akin to \"mentalizing\" in the psychological literature, is based upon the outcomes of interpersonal exchanges. (2) We show how some well-known social-psychological phenomena (e.g., self-serving biases) can be explained in terms of active interpersonal inference. (3) Mentalizing naturally entails Bayesian updating of how people value social outcomes. Crucially this includes inference about one's own qualities and preferences. Conclusion: We inaugurate a Bayes optimal framework for modeling intersubject variability in mentalizing during interpersonal exchanges. Here, interpersonal representations are endowed with explicit functional and affective properties. We suggest the active inference framework lends itself to the study of psychiatric conditions where mentalizing is distorted. © 2014 Moutoussis, Trujillo-Barreto, El-Deredy, Dolan and Friston.","<b>Bayesian inference of epidemics on networks via belief propagation<\/b><br><br>We study several Bayesian inference problems for irreversible stochastic epidemic models on networks from a statistical physics viewpoint. We derive equations which allow us to accurately compute the posterior distribution of the time evolution of the state of each node given some observations. At difference with most existing methods, we allow very general observation models, including unobserved nodes, state observations made at different or unknown times, and observations of infection times, possibly mixed together. Our method, which is based on the belief propagation algorithm, is efficient, naturally distributed, and exact on trees. As a particular case, we consider the problem of finding the \"zero patient\" of a susceptible-infected-recovered or susceptible-infected epidemic given a snapshot of the state of the network at a later unknown time.

Rough Sets Theory (RST) has evolved into a methodology for dealing with different types of problems, such as the uncertainty produced by inconsistencies in data. RST is the best tool for modeling uncertainty when it shows up as inconsistency, according to several analyses. This is the main reason for which the RST has been included in the family of Soft Computing techniques. The classical RST is defined by using an equivalence relation as an indiscernibility relation. This is very restrictive in different domains, so several extensions of the theory have been formulated. One of these alternatives is based on a probabilistic approach, where several variants have been proposed such as the Variable Precision Rough Sets model, Rough Bayesian model, and Parameterized Rough Set model. Here is presented an analysis about the evolution of the RST in order to enrich the applicability to solve real problems by means of the probabilistic approaches of rough sets and its application to knowledge discovering and decision making, two main activities in Business Intelligence. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","<b>A comparison of myoelectric pattern recognition methods to control an upper limb active exoskeleton<\/b><br><br>Physically impaired people may use Surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals to control assistive devices in an automatic way. sEMG signals directly reflect the human motion intention, they can be used as input information for active exoskeleton control.

The algorithms use a feature extraction stage based on a combination of time and frequency domain features (mean absolute value - waveform length, and auto-regressive model, respectively). The pattern recognition stage uses Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine and Bayesian classifiers. Additionally, two post-processing techniques are incorporated: majority vote and transition removal. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated with parameters of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, error rate and active error rate, under typical conditions. These evaluations allow identifying pattern recognition algorithms for real-time control of an active exoskeleton. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","<b>A switching multi-scale dynamical network model of EEG/MEG<\/b><br><br>We introduce a new generative model of the Encephalography (EEG/MEG) data, the inversion of which allows for inferring the locations and temporal evolution of the underlying sources as well as their dynamical interactions. The proposed Switching Mesostate Space Model (SMSM) builds on the multi-scale generative model for EEG/MEG by Daunizeau and Friston (2007). SMSM inherits the assumptions that (1) bioelectromagnetic activity is generated by a set of distributed sources, (2) the dynamics of these sources can be modelled as random fluctuations about a small number of mesostates, and (3) the number of mesostates engaged by a cognitive task is small. Additionally, four generalising assumptions are now included: (4) the mesostates interact according to a full Dynamical Causal Network (DCN) that can be estimated; (5) the dynamics of the mesostates can switch between multiple approximately linear operating regimes; (6) each operating regime remains stable over finite periods of time (temporal clusters); and (7) the total number of times the mesostates' dynamics can switch is small. The proposed model adds, therefore, a level of flexibility by accommodating complex brain processes that cannot be characterised by purely linear and stationary Gaussian dynamics. Importantly, the SMSM furnishes a new interpretation of the EEG/MEG data in which the source activity may have multiple discrete modes of behaviour, each with approximately linear dynamics. This is modelled by assuming that the connection strengths of the underlying mesoscopic DCN are time-dependent but piecewise constant, i.e. they can undergo discrete changes over time. A Variational Bayes inversion scheme is derived to estimate all the parameters of the model by maximising a (Negative Free Energy) lower bound on the model evidence. This bound is used to select among different model choices that are defined by the number of mesostates as well as by the number of stationary linear regimes. The full model is compared to a simplified version that uses no dynamical assumptions as well as to a standard EEG inversion technique. The comparison is carried out using an extensive set of simulations, and the application of SMSM to a real data set is also demonstrated. Our results show that for experimental situations in which we have some a priori belief that there are multiple approximately linear dynamical regimes, the proposed SMSM provides a natural modelling tool. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Long-term information and distributed neural activation arerelevant for the \"internal features advantage\" in face processing: Electrophysiological and source reconstruction evidence<\/b><br><br>In face processing tasks, prior presentation of internal facial features, when compared with external ones, facilitates the recognition of subsequently displayed familiar faces. In a previous ERP study ( Olivares & Iglesias, 2010) we found a visibly larger N400-like effect when identity mismatch familiar faces were preceded by internal features, as compared to prior presentation of external ones. In the present study we contrasted the processing of familiar and unfamiliar faces in the face-feature matching task to assess whether the so-called \"internal features advantage\" relies mainly on the use of stored face-identity-related information or if it might operate independently from stimulus familiarity. Our participants ( N=24) achieved better performance with internal features as primes and, significantly, with familiar faces. Importantly, ERPs elicited by identity mismatch complete faces displayed a negativity around 300-600msec which was clearly enhanced for familiar faces primed by internal features when compared with the other experimental conditions. Source reconstruction showed incremented activity elicited by familiar stimuli in both posterior (ventral occipitotemporal) and more anterior (parahippocampal (ParaHIP) and orbitofrontal) brain regions. The activity elicited by unfamiliar stimuli was, in general, located in more posterior regions. Ourfindings suggest that the activation of multiple neural codes is required for optimalindividuation in face-feature matching and that a cortical network related to long-term information for face-identity processing seems to support the internal feature effect. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","<b>Single-molecule folding mechanism of an EF-hand neuronal calcium sensor<\/b><br><br>EF-hand calcium sensors respond structurally to changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, triggering diverse cellular responses and resulting in broad interactomes.

We used single-molecule optical tweezers to study the folding mechanism of the human neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS1). Two intermediate structures induced by Ca2+ binding to the EF-hands were observed during refolding. The complete folding of the C domain is obligatory for the folding of the N domain, showing striking interdomain dependence. Molecular dynamics results reveal the atomistic details of the unfolding process and rationalize the different domain stabilities during mechanical unfolding.

The introduction of a new virus with increased transmissibility into a population makes surveillance of the pandemic strain to the molecular level necessary. The aim of the present study was the molecular and phylogenetic analysis of pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains that circulated in Cuba between May 2009 and August 2010. Seventy clinical samples were included in the study. Nucleotide sequences from the hemagglutinin HA1 region segment were obtained directly from clinical samples. Genetic distances were calculated using MEGA v.5.05. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using MrBayes v.3.1.2 software. Potential N-glycosylation sites were predicted using NetNGlyc server 1.0. The 48 Cuban sequences of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 obtained were similar to the A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain. Most of the Cuban strains belonged to clade 7. Cuban viruses showed amino acid changes, some of them located at three antigenic sites: Ca, Sa, and Sb. Two dominant mutations were detected: P83S (100%) and S203T (85.7%). Glycosylation site analysis revealed the gain of one site at position 162 in 13 sequences.

The current study was designed to rigorously measure the global phylogeographic dynamics of IBDV strains to gain insight into viral population expansion as well as the emergence, spread and pattern of the geographical structure of very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) strains.Methodology/Principal Findings:Sequences of the hyper-variable region of the VP2 (HVR-VP2) gene from IBDV strains isolated from diverse geographic locations were obtained from the GenBank database; Cuban sequences were obtained in the current work. All sequences were analysed by Bayesian phylogeographic analysis, implemented in the Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST), Bayesian Tip-association Significance testing (BaTS) and Spatial Phylogenetic Reconstruction of Evolutionary Dynamics (SPREAD) software packages. Selection pressure on the HVR-VP2 was also assessed. The phylogeographic association-trait analysis showed that viruses sampled from individual countries tend to cluster together, suggesting a geographic pattern for IBDV strains. Spatial analysis from this study revealed that strains carrying sequences that were linked to increased virulence of IBDV appeared in Iran in 1981 and spread to Western Europe (Belgium) in 1987, Africa (Egypt) around 1990, East Asia (China and Japan) in 1993, the Caribbean Region (Cuba) by 1995 and South America (Brazil) around 2000. Selection pressure analysis showed that several codons in the HVR-VP2 region were under purifying selection.Conclusions/Significance:To our knowledge, this work is the first study applying the Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction approach to analyse the emergence and spread of vvIBDV strains worldwide. © 2013 Alfonso-Morales et al.","<b>Genetic introgression and hybridization in Antillean freshwater turtles (Trachemys) revealed by coalescent analyses of mitochondrial and cloned nuclear markers<\/b><br><br>Determining whether a conflict between gene trees and species trees represents incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) or hybridization involving native and/or invasive species has implications for reconstructing evolutionary relationships and guiding conservation decisions. Among vertebrates, turtles represent an exceptional case for exploring these issues because of the propensity for even distantly related lineages to hybridize. In this study we investigate a group of freshwater turtles (Trachemys) from a part of its range (the Greater Antilles) where it is purported to have undergone reticulation events from both natural and anthropogenic processes. We sequenced mtDNA for 83 samples, sequenced three nuDNA markers for 45 samples, and cloned 29 polymorphic sequences, to identify species boundaries, hybridization, and intergrade zones for Antillean Trachemys and nearby mainland populations. Initial coalescent analyses of phased nuclear alleles (using *BEAST) recovered a Bayesian species tree that strongly conflicted with the mtDNA phylogeny and traditional taxonomy, and appeared to be confounded by hybridization. Therefore, we undertook exploratory phylogenetic analyses of mismatched alleles from the \" coestimated\" gene trees (Heled and Drummond, 2010) in order to identify potential hybrid origins. The geography, morphology, and sampling context of most samples with potential introgressed alleles suggest hybridization over ILS. We identify contact zones between different species on Jamaica (T. decussata×T. terrapen), on Hispaniola (T. decorata×T. stejnegeri), and in Central America (T. emolli×T. venusta). We are unable to determine whether the distribution of T. decussata on Jamaica is natural or the result of prehistoric introduction by Native Americans. This uncertainty means that the conservation status of the Jamaican T. decussata populations and contact zone with T. terrapen are unresolved. Human-mediated dispersal events were more conclusively implicated for the prehistoric translocation of T. stejnegeri between Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, as well as the more recent genetic pollution of native species by an invasive pet turtle native to the USA (T. scripta elegans). Finally, we test the impact of introgressed alleles using the multispecies coalescent in a Bayesian framework and show that studies that do not phase heterozygote sequences of hybrid individuals may recover the correct species tree, but overall support for clades that include hybrid individuals may be reduced. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","<b>\"Neuronic localizador de fuentes\": Sistema para el cálculo de la tomografía eléctrica/magnética cerebral<\/b><br><br>Brain Electric/Magnetic Tomography (BET /BMT) consists of a 3D-image reconstruction of the Primary Current Density inside the brain from the signals measured outside the head, which can be considered as a functional neuroimaging modality.

The winter range of Bicknell's Thrush (Catharus bicknelli), a threatened Nearctic-Neotropical migratory songbird, is restricted to the Greater Antilles. We analyzed winter records from the mid-1970s to 2009 to quantitatively evaluate winter distribution and habitat selection. Additionally, we conducted targeted surveys in Jamaica (n = 433), Cuba (n = 363), Dominican Republic (n = 1,000), Haiti (n = 131) and Puerto Rico (n = 242) yielding 179 sites with thrush presence. We modeled Bicknell's Thrush winter habitat selection and distribution in the Greater Antilles in Maxent version 3.3.1. using environmental predictors represented in 30 arc second study area rasters. These included nine landform, land cover and climatic variables that were thought a priori to have potentially high predictive power. We used the average training gain from ten model runs to select the best subset of predictors. Total winter precipitation, aspect and land cover, particularly broadleaf forests, emerged as important variables. A five-variable model that contained land cover, winter precipitation, aspect, slope, and elevation was the most parsimonious and not significantly different than the models with more variables. We used the best fitting model to depict potential winter habitat. Using the 10 percentile threshold (>0.25), we estimated winter habitat to cover 33,170 km2, nearly 10% of the study area. The Dominican Republic contained half of all potential habitat (51%), followed by Cuba (15.1%), Jamaica (13.5%), Haiti (10.6%), and Puerto Rico (9.9%). Nearly one-third of the range was found to be in protected areas.

Objective: this study aimed to explore the effect of pre-dialysis erythropoiesisstimulating agent (ESA) use on the left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) or general and renal function protective effect in CKD3b-4 patients. Different than in introducción in Spanish. Patients and methods: open multicentric assay. A 56-week follow-Up doseresponse study. The change from baseline to the end of treatment was calculated for glomerular filtration rate by MDRD (GFR,) and, LVH by echocardiography at 24 months. Results: the treatment significantly increased hematocrit (Htc) in all patients who completed the study (n = 33, 0.29 ± 0.02(V%) versus 0.38 ± 0.03, P (Wilcoxon)= 0.000. In the beginning 90,9% At the end only the 78.8% the patients had LVH, it was decreased 2.2 mm (14 a 11.8 mm), and significant reverse lineal correlation between the change in the LVH and Hb concentration was noted (r = -0.379; p = 0.030). Progression of the CKD was slow (mL/min). Diabetics 37.2 ± 8.4 versus 34.7 ± 6.7 (p Wilcoxon=0.119) non diabetics 35.1 ± 7.833.6 ± 7.7 (p Wilcoxon= 0.119). 48.5% of the patients had Adverse effects (AE). No patients died or started in dialysis. The Balance Benefit- Risk (AE moderate or severe) estimated from the Bayes Factor was evidence to the benefit (BF=1, 64). Conclusion: we observed that correction of anemia with rhuEpo in patients with CKD 3b seems to improve the LVH without another problems and it is beneficial. The results of this study support the treatment of severe anemia with EPO.","<b>Causal knowledge representation techniques: A case study in medical informatics<\/b><br><br>It is a common endeavor in medicine to identify and represent causal relationships between variables of interest. A computational representation of causal knowledge should be based on directed graphs. There are two main techniques: bayesian networks and fuzzy cognitive maps. The present paper compares the two techniques and shows the advantages of fuzzy cognitive maps. It is suggested that fuzzy cognitive maps be used in medicine. A procedure to obtain causal models is described. A case study is presented showing the applicability of the proposal, as well as the advantages of cognitive maps to represent causal knowledge in a given situation. Future research is proposed to expand the use of fuzzy cognitive maps.","<b>Recognition of arm activities based on Hidden Markov Models for natural interaction with service robots<\/b><br><br>This research presents a novel way of representing human motion and recognizing human activities from the skeleton output computed from RGB-D data from vision-based motion capture systems.

The idea is to reconstruct the original data from the noise-corruptec signal suppressing, all or almost all, the distortion caused by the inherent noise of the physical processes. In the present paper, we perform a comparative review of several noise reduction techniques based on adaptive threshold selection. These techniques have been extensively used for image processing. However, we aimed at evaluating their performance for industrial signal noise reduction. In particular, we analyze the behaviour of the Bayes Shrink, Normal Shrink, Modified Shrink, and Neight Shrink methods for the reduction of the Gaussian noise in industrial signals. To that aim, we perform experiments on a set of pattern signals proposed by Donoho and other representative measurements obtained from real processes in Cuban's Nickel plants. Our results indicate that, for this kind of data, the Neigh Shrink algorithm outperforms the other techniques. © 2013 CEA.","<b>Computing sources of epileptic discharges using the novel BMA approach: Comparison with other distributed inverse solution methods<\/b><br><br>Electroencephalography (EEG) source localization in epileptology continues to be a challenge for neuroscientists. A number of inverse solution (IS) methodologies have been proposed to solve this problem, and their advantages and limitations have been described. In the present work, a previously developed IS approach called Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is introduced in clinical practice in order to improve the localization accuracy of epileptic discharge sources. For this study, 31 patients with the diagnosis of partial epilepsies were studied: 14 had benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes and 17 had temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The underlying epileptic sources were localized using the BMA approach, and the results were compared with those expected from the clinical diagnosis. Additional comparisons with results obtained from 3 of the most commonly used distributed IS methods for these purposes (minimum norm [MN], weighted minimum norm [WMN], and low-resolution electromagnetic tomography [LORETA]) were carried out in terms of source localization accuracy and spatial resolutions. The BMA approach estimated discharge sources that were consistent with the clinical diagnosis, and this method outperformed LORETA, MN, and WMN in terms of both localization accuracy and spatial resolution. The BMA was able to localize deeper generators with high accuracy. In conclusion, the BMA methodology has a great potential for the noninvasive accurate localization of epileptic sources, even those located in deeper structures. Therefore, it could be a promising tool for clinical practice in epileptology, although additional studies in other types of epileptic syndromes are necessary. © EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ECNS) 2013.","<b>Statistical procedures most used in the analysis of measures repeated in time in the agricultural sector<\/b><br><br>In the agricultural research, situations are presented where it is difficult to use the classical linear models of analysis of variance, because the assumptions of independence, equality of variances and linearity are not fulfilled by making measures repeated in time. This paper had as object to review the statistical procedures used to analyze the designs of measures repeated in time, and determine which analytical strategies are more appropriate for each purpose. In this study, three types of traditionally used analyses are described: univariate variance (ANOVA), multivariate variance (MANOVA), and the recent one, the approach of mixed models. At present, it has been agreed that the latter is the most adequate and versatile, because it provides the possibility of examining data with structures of dependence, unbalance, and lack of normality. Besides, it provides a solution to the limitation of the multivariate analysis of variance in respect to the number of individuals and variables. Also, the model of random effects is described, another member of the wide spectrum of the mixed models that is used in numerous studies in the agricultural field. This approach is strengthened by the use of selection criteria of models, due to the estimation of parameters is based on methods of maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) are described, permitting the optimum selection of competing mixed models.","<b>Sensibility analysis of homogeneity tests of in vitro gas production curves by Monte Carlo simulation<\/b><br><br>In order to improve the ruminant feed evaluation techniques through a statistical method permitting the comparison of treatments in experiments of in vitro gas production, based on regression curves, data were collected from an experiment of in vitro gas production. The Gompertz function was fitted and the Monte Carlo simulation method was used, with the aim of analyzing the sensibility of four homogeneity tests of non-linear regression models. Thirteen new treatments were obtained, with 300 repetitions each and 280 points simulated per each repetition. The homogeneity tests were: extra sum of squares, Bayesian information criterion (BIC), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Akaike information criterion corrected (AICC). The comparison criteria were assessed with modifications to the parameters, on the order of 1, 3, 5, and 10 %. The methodology for the comparison of the curves was based on the definition of the complete and the reduced models. The sensibility of each method was established according to the probability of fulfillment of the null hypothesis. The AICC showed higher sensibility, followed by the test of extra sum of squares. The AIC and the BIC were the least sensible. The parameter that affected the most the differences between treatments was the asymptotic coefficient (A).","<b>Positive selection pressure on the B/C domains of the E2-gene of classical swine fever virus in endemic areas under C-strain vaccination<\/b><br><br>In Cuba, classical swine fever (CSF) has become an endemic disease with several outbreaks each year, despite the implemented vaccination program. Interestingly, a trend towards a milder presentation of the disease has been observed among the animals during the last years. This study aimed to assess positive selection pressure acting on partial E2 gene of CSF viruses to gain insights into the mechanisms governing virulence and the driving forces of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) evolution in swine populations under regular vaccination. Selection pressure analysis were performed to detect positive selection acting on a particular lineage as well as among sites of the E2-B/C-domain of CSFV nucleotide sequences, reported in a previous study and in the present work, several models, available in the CODEML module of PAML 4.3, were used. In addition, a representative Cuban CSF isolate was assessed in an experimental infection trial for their clinical virulence in order to expand the knowledge regarding CSF viruses circulating in pig populations. The viral genomes sequenced in this study were grouped in a defined cluster within the genotype 1.2, as it has been reported previously for Cuban CSF viruses. The selection pressure analysis didn't find evidence of positive selection (dN/dS of > 1) along any branch. The positive selective pressure analysis estimated six new sites under positive selection on E2 partial gene analysed. Besides, the clinical manifestations of the CSF-disease were related mainly to a mild course of the illness. The high number of positively selected sites suggests that these changes could be associated to viral evasion of the host-immune response. These observations highlight a possible association between escape viral variants and the alterations observed in the virulence and pathogenesis of the virus. Therefore, while the vaccination programs have not led to a genotype change, alterations in virulence were suggested to arise. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","<b>A non Bayesian predictive approach for functional calibration<\/b><br><br>A non Bayesian predictive approach for statistical calibration with functional data is introduced. This is based on extending to the functional calibration setting the definition of non Bayesian predictive probability density proposed by Harris (1989).

It is shown through numerical simulations that the introduced non Bayesian predictive estimator of the unknown parameter of interest in calibration (commonly, a substance concentration) has negligible bias and compares favorably with the classical estimator, particularly in extrapolation problems.

This focuses on independent component analysis (ICA)-based EEG/fMRI fusion. In order to appreciate the issues, we first describe the potential and limitations of the developed fusion approaches: fMRI-constrained EEG imaging, EEG-informed fMRI analysis, and symmetric fusion. We then outline some newly developed hybrid fusion techniques using ICA and the combination of data-/model-driven methods, with special mention of the spatiotemporal EEG/fMRI fusion (STEFF). Finally, we discuss the current trend in methodological development and the existing limitations for extrapolating neural dynamics. © 2012 Imperial College Press.","<b>Improved double-robust estimation in missing data and causal inference models<\/b><br><br>Recently proposed double-robust estimators for a population mean from incomplete data and for a finite number of counterfactual means can have much higher efficiency than the usual double-robust estimators under misspecification of the outcome model. In this paper, we derive a new class of double-robust estimators for the parameters of regression models with incomplete cross-sectional or longitudinal data, and of marginal structural mean models for cross-sectional data with similar efficiency properties. Unlike the recent proposals, our estimators solve outcome regression estimating equations. In a simulation study, the new estimator shows improvements in variance relative to the standard double-robust estimator that are in agreement with those suggested by asymptotic theory. © 2012 Biometrika Trust.","<b>A non-Bayesian predictive approach for statistical calibration<\/b><br><br>A non-Bayesian predictive approach for statistical calibration is introduced.

Insights into dengue evolution under hyperendemic transmission<\/b><br><br>During the past three decades there has been a notable increase in dengue disease severity in Venezuela. Nevertheless, the population structure of the viruses being transmitted in this country is not well understood. Here, we present a molecular epidemiological study on dengue viruses (DENV) circulating in Aragua State, Venezuela during 2006-2007. Twenty-one DENV full-length genomes representing all of the four serotypes were amplified and sequenced directly from the serum samples. Notably, only DENV-2 was associated with severe disease. Phylogenetic trees constructed using Bayesian methods indicated that only one genotype was circulating for each serotype. However, extensive viral genetic diversity was found in DENV isolated from the same area during the same period, indicating significant in situ evolution since the introduction of these genotypes. Collectively, the results suggest that the non-structural (NS) proteins may play an important role in DENV evolution, particularly NS1, NS2A and NS4B proteins. The phylogenetic data provide evidence to suggest that multiple introductions of DENV have occurred from the Latin American region into Venezuela and vice versa. The implications of the significant viral genetic diversity generated during hyperendemic transmission, particularly in NS protein are discussed and considered in the context of future development and use of human monoclonal antibodies as antivirals and tetravalent vaccines. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Modern approaches to bias and causation in epidemiological research<\/b><br><br>The concepts of causation and bias are crucial to modern biomedical research, ranging from the analysis of hundreds of exposure factors to megatrials, in order to assess the impact of interventions. As consumers of these research products, we are amazed that a statement made today is put into question tomorrow, discarded afterwards, and eventually retaken in the future from different perspectives or under different assumptions. Although the methodological bias is not the only culprit, it plays an important role as determinant of this reality. This paper intended to clarify the concept of bias, which is relevant, among other possible meanings, to contemporary biomedical research, and its association with the technical meaning of confounding. Other objectives were to present the current vision on the practical meaning of cause in epidemiological causal inference, and to critically review two modern analytical tools to deal with bias and causation such as propensity scores and instrumental variables.","<b>Mental maps and travel behaviour: Meanings and models<\/b><br><br>In this paper, the \"mental map\" concept is positioned with regard to individual travel behaviour to start with. Based on Ogden and Richards' triangle of meaning (The meaning of meaning: a study of the influence of language upon thought and of the science of symbolism. International library of psychology, philosophy and scientific method. Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1966) distinct thoughts, referents and symbols originating from different scientific disciplines are identified and explained in order to clear up the notion's fuzziness. Next, the use of this concept in two major areas of research relevant to travel demand modelling is indicated and discussed in detail: spatial cognition and decision-making. The relevance of these constructs to understand and model individual travel behaviour is explained and current research efforts to implement these concepts in travel demand models are addressed. Furthermore, these mental map notions are specified in two types of computational models, i. e. a Bayesian Inference Network (BIN) and a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM). Both models are explained, and a numerical and a real-life example are provided. Both approaches yield a detailed quantitative representation of the mental map of decision-making problems in travel behaviour. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","<b>Characterizing and improving generalized belief propagation algorithms on the 2D Edwards-Anderson model<\/b><br><br>We study the performance of different message passing algorithms in the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model. We show that the standard belief propagation (BP) algorithm converges only at high temperature to a paramagnetic solution. Then, we test a generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithm, derived from a cluster variational method (CVM) at the plaquette level. We compare its performance with BP and with other algorithms derived under the same approximation: double loop (DL) and a two-way message passing algorithm (HAK). The plaquette-CVM approximation improves BP in at least three ways: the quality of the paramagnetic solution at high temperatures, a better estimate (lower) for the critical temperature, and the fact that the GBP message passing algorithm converges also to nonparamagnetic solutions. The lack of convergence of the standard GBP message passing algorithm at low temperatures seems to be related to the implementation details and not to the appearance of long range order. In fact, we prove that a gauge invariance of the constrained CVM free energy can be exploited to derive a new message passing algorithm which converges at even lower temperatures. In all its region of convergence this new algorithm is faster than HAK and DL by some orders of magnitude. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.","<b>An alignment-free approach for eukaryotic ITS2 annotation and phylogenetic inference<\/b><br><br>The ITS2 gene class shows a high sequence divergence among its members that have complicated its annotation and its use for reconstructing phylogenies at a higher taxonomical level (beyond species and genus). Several alignment strategies have been implemented to improve the ITS2 annotation quality and its use for phylogenetic inferences. Although, alignment based methods have been exploited to the top of its complexity to tackle both issues, no alignment-free approaches have been able to successfully address both topics. By contrast, the use of simple alignment-free classifiers, like the topological indices (TIs) containing information about the sequence and structure of ITS2, may reveal to be a useful approach for the gene prediction and for assessing the phylogenetic relationships of the ITS2 class in eukaryotes. Thus, we used the TI2BioP (Topological Indices to BioPolymers) methodology [1,2], freely available at http://ti2biop.sourceforge.net/ to calculate two different TIs. One class was derived from the ITS2 artificial 2D structures generated from DNA strings and the other from the secondary structure inferred from RNA folding algorithms. Two alignment-free models based on Artificial Neural Networks were developed for the ITS2 class prediction using the two classes of TIs referred above. Both models showed similar performances on the training and the test sets reaching values above 95% in the overall classification. Due to the importance of the ITS2 region for fungi identification, a novel ITS2 genomic sequence was isolated from Petrakia sp. This sequence and the test set were used to comparatively evaluate the conventional classification models based on multiple sequence alignments like Hidden Markov based approaches, revealing the success of our models to identify novel ITS2 members. The isolated sequence was assessed using traditional and alignment-free based techniques applied to phylogenetic inference to complement the taxonomy of the Petrakia sp. fungal isolate. © 2011 Agüero-Chapin et al.","<b>Analysis of hepatitis C virus core encoding sequences in chronically infected patients reveals mutability, predominance, genetic history and potential impact on therapy of Cuban genotype 1b isolates<\/b><br><br>Background and Objectives: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes are relevant to epidemiological questions, vaccine development, and clinical management of chronic HCV infection. In the present work, we aimed at investigating HCV genotype, variability and genetic history of HCV isolates in Cuba from a sample of chronically infected patients. Material and Methods: A prospective study, involving 73 Cuban anti-HCV positive patients, was carried out. RT-PCR and phylogenetic analysis was employed to determine HCV genotypes. Divergence dates and demographic parameters in a Bayesian coalescent framework were estimated, as implemented in BEAST v1.4.8. Results: HCV RNA was undetectable in 15 patients that received antiviral therapy. All HCV RNA positive patients, 58, were infected with genotype 1, three of them with subtype 1a and 55 with subtype 1b. The analysis of the DNA sequence coding for a core fragment, spanning nt positions 435-816 (relative to strain H77), revealed high percent (96.7% ± 0.8%) nucleotide identity within Cuban HCV subtype 1b sequences. However, 56.7% and 20% of 30 analyzed individuals had changes in the core region in a six-month interval, at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively. Mutations involving aa changes were mainly found in the region encompassed between aa 70 and 106 of the core protein, with only one isolate showing a point mutation at position 43. Interestingly, some of the observed changes seem to be reversions and might in fact contribute to reducing the variability of this region. The estimated date for the most recent common ancestor of HCV genotype 1b Cuban isolates is 1969 (CI, 1953 to 1977). Discussion: Analysis of HCV core encoding sequences from chronic patients reveals mutability of genotype 1b isolates in Cuba, which seem to be predominant and rapidly multiplied during the eighty decade of last century, and might limit the benefits obtained from current antiviral therapy.","<b>Inference algorithm for finite-dimensional spin glasses: Belief propagation on the dual lattice<\/b><br><br>Starting from a cluster variational method, and inspired by the correctness of the paramagnetic ansatz [at high temperatures in general, and at any temperature in the two-dimensional (2D) Edwards-Anderson (EA) model] we propose a message-passing algorithm-the dual algorithm-to estimate the marginal probabilities of spin glasses on finite-dimensional lattices. We use the EA models in 2D and 3D as benchmarks. The dual algorithm improves the Bethe approximation, and we show that in a wide range of temperatures (compared to the Bethe critical temperature) our algorithm compares very well with Monte Carlo simulations, with the double-loop algorithm, and with exact calculation of the ground state of 2D systems with bimodal and Gaussian interactions. Moreover, it is usually 100 times faster than other provably convergent methods, as the double-loop algorithm.

In this study, a comparison between methodologies based on classical phylogenetic trees and networks to infer the origin of PCV2 in Cuba was performed. In addition, the mechanisms supporting the genetic variability of Cuban PCV2 populations were investigated. A retrospective study, using pig sera collected in Cuba from 1993 to 2004, to evaluate the presence of PCV2 genome and PCV2-specific antibodies was also conducted and revealed a lack of evidence of PCV2 infection in Cuban swine from years 1993 to 2004. A total of 24 complete Cuban PCV2 sequences collected between 2005 and 2009 from different regions of the country were analyzed. Three classical methods of phylogenetic analysis, namely Neighbour-Joining, Maximum Parsimony and Bayesian Inference, as well as haplotype network construction, were used. Whereas the classical phylogenetic trees suggested different origins for the Cuban PCV2 strains, the haplotype network revealed a direct connection between all the Cuban sequences in agreement with the obtained epidemiological and viral sequence data. Moreover, the importation of pigs carried out in 2005 from the Quebec-Ontario region, Canada, seems to be the most likely origin of PCV2 in Cuba. Likewise, the genetic variability of Cuban PCV2 sequences was supported by geographic segregation and positive selection pressure with estimated rates of nucleotide substitution on the order of 3.12×10 -3 and 6.57×10 -3 substitutions/site/year, which are closer to those reported for RNA viruses. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","<b>A comparative study of nonlinear machine learning for the \"in silico\" depiction of tyrosinase inhibitory activity from molecular structure<\/b><br><br>In the preset report, for the first time, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), Bayesian networks (BNs), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) are applied and compared on two \"in-house\" datasets to describe the tyrosinase inhibitory activity from the molecular structure. The data set Data I is used for the identification of tyrosinase inhibitors (TIs) including 701 active and 728 inactive compounds. Data II consists of active chemicals for potency estimation of TIs. The 2D TOMOCOMD-CARDD atom-based quadratic indices are used as molecular descriptors. The derived models show rather encouraging results with the areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AURC) curve in the test set above 0.943 and 0.846 for the Data I and Data II, respectively. Multiple comparison tests are carried out to compare the performance of the models and reveal the improvement of machine learning (ML) techniques with respect to statistical ones (see Chemometr. Intell. Lab. Syst. 2010, 104, 249). In some cases, these ameliorations are statistically significant. The tests also demostrate that k-NN, despite being a rather simple approach, presents the best behavior in both data. The obtained results suggest that the ML-based models could help to improve the virtual screening procedures and the confluence of these different techniques can increase the practicality of data mining procedures of chemical databases for the discovery of novel TIs as possible depigmenting agents.

Thus, the Topological Indices to BioPolymers (TI2BioP) methodology (Agüero-Chapin et al., 2010) inspired in both the TOPS-MODE and the MARCH-INSIDE methodologies allows the calculation of simple topological indices (TIs) as alignment-free classifiers. These indices were derived from the clustering of the amino acids into four classes of hydrophobicity and polarity revealing higher sequence-order information beyond the amino acid composition level. The predictability power of such TIs was evaluated for the first time on the RNase III family, due to the high diversity of its members (primary sequence and domain organization). Three non-linear models were developed for RNase III class prediction: Decision Tree Model (DTM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)-model and Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The first two are alignment-free approaches, using TIs as input predictors. Their performances were compared with a non-classical HMM, modified according to our amino acid clustering strategy. The alignment-free models showed similar performances on the training and the test sets reaching values above 90% in the overall classification. The non-classical HMM showed the highest rate in the classification with values above 95% in training and 100% in test. Although the higher accuracy of the HMM, the DTM showed simplicity for the RNase III classification with low computational cost. Such simplicity was evaluated in respect to HMM and ANN models for the functional annotation of a new bacterial RNase III class member, isolated and annotated by our group. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","<b>Genetic algorithm optimization in drug design QSAR: Bayesian-regularized genetic neural networks (BRGNN) and genetic algorithm-optimized support vectors machines (GA-SVM)<\/b><br><br>Many articles in \"in silico\" drug design implemented genetic algorithm (GA) for feature selection, model optimization, conformational search, or docking studies.

This study analyses the phylogeography of these species to assess possible colonization events from Central America to the islands and subsequent population expansions during glacial periods driven by both drier climate and larger emerged land areas. • Methods: Allele size data were obtained for plastid microsatellites for 314 individuals from 24 populations, covering the distribution range of subsection Australes in the Caribbean Basin. • Key Results: In total, 113 plastid haplotypes were identified. The highest genetic diversity was found in populations of P. caribaea. Overall, Caribbean Basin populations fit the isolation by distance model. Significant phylogeographical structure was found (RST 0·671 > permuted RST 0·101; P < 0·0001). The haplotype network and a Bayesian analysis of population structure (BAPS) indicated different Central American origins for P. caribaea var. bahamensis and P. caribaea var. caribaea plastids, with Central America populations in northern and south-eastern groups. Sudden expansion times for BAPS clusters were close to three glacial maxima. • Conclusions: Central America contains ancestral plastid haplotypes. Population expansion has played a major role in the distribution of genetic diversity in P. caribaea var. hondurensis. Two colonization events gave rise to the P. caribaea var. bahamensis and P. caribaea var. caribaea lineages. Plastid variation in the eastern species (P. cubensis, P. maestrensis and P. occidentalis) evolved independently from that in P. caribaea var. caribaea. Incomplete lineage sorting between P. cubensis and P. maestrensis is apparent.

Six different statistical models were used which had in common as fixed effects the contemporary groups (year-herd-season-sex) and the covariables, linear weaning age and mother's age at linear and quadratic calving. Model 1 only included the random effect of the animal, model 2 also included the random effect of permanent environment, model 3 was equal to 1 but also including the random maternal genetic effect, regardless of the existence of covariance between the additive and maternal effects, model 4 was equal to 3 but considering the existence of covariance between additive and maternal effects, models 5 and 6 were the same as models 3 and 4, respectively, but adding the random effect of permanent environment. Weaning weight averaged 159.7 kg, with a standard deviation of 26.7 kg. Three criteria to compare models were used the log-likelihood (log L), Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Model 1 was that of worst fit considering the three criteria. Taking into account the criterion log L models 5 and 6 did not differ significantly between them and were the best compared to the rest. AIC and BIC criteria indicate the model 5 as the best. Heritability for the direct additive effect (0.32) in modelo1 was higher than that estimated for the other models (0.02 to 0.06). Heritabilities estimated for maternal effects in models of best fit reached values of 0.06 (model 5) and 0.04 (model 6), which although higher than those of the direct effect are also low. Permanent environmental effects determined between 10.9% (model 6) and 15.4% (model 3) of the total variability. The genetic correlation between direct and maternal effects reached values of 0.53 and 0.61 for models 4 and 6, respectively. The results indicate that there is little possibility of improving the weaning weight by selection in the present population.","<b>Model driven EEG/fMRI fusion of brain oscillations<\/b><br><br>This article reviews progress and challenges in model driven EEG/fMRI fusion with a focus on brain oscillations. Fusion is the combination of both imaging modalities based on a cascade of forward models from ensemble of post-synaptic potentials (ePSP) to net primary current densities (nPCD) to EEG; and from ePSP to vasomotor feed forward signal (VFFSS) to BOLD. In absence of a model, data driven fusion creates maps of correlations between EEG and BOLD or between estimates of nPCD and VFFS. A consistent finding has been that of positive correlations between EEG alpha power and BOLD in both frontal cortices and thalamus and of negative ones for the occipital region. For model driven fusion we formulate a neural mass EEG/fMRI model coupled to a metabolic hemodynamic model. For exploratory simulations we show that the Local Linearization (LL) method for integrating stochastic differential equations is appropriate for highly nonlinear dynamics. It has been successfully applied to small and medium sized networks, reproducing the described EEG/BOLD correlations. A new LL-algebraic method allows simulations with hundreds of thousands of neural populations, with connectivities and conduction delays estimated from diffusion weighted MRI. For parameter and state estimation, Kalman filtering combined with the LL method estimates the innovations or prediction errors. From these the likelihood of models given data are obtained. The LL-innovation estimation method has been already applied to small and medium scale models. With improved Bayesian computations the practical estimation of very large scale EEG/fMRI models shall soon be possible. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","<b>Spatial analysis of breast and cervical cancer incidence in small geographical areas in Cuba, 1999-2003<\/b><br><br>According to the data from the National Cancer Registry, breast and cervical cancer are the two most common nonskin cancers in Cuban woman. This study was addressed to describe the geographical variation of their incidence at small area level over the period 1999-2003. For each municipality, standardized incidence ratios were calculated and smoothed using a Poisson-Gamma, Poisson-Lognormal and a Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) model. The covariate 'urbanization level' was included in the Poisson-Lognormal and CAR models. The posterior probability of each municipality's relative risk (RR) exceeding unity was computed. Clusters were confirmed using the spatial scan statistic of Kulldorff. The CAR model provided the best fit for the geographical distribution of breast and cervical cancer in Cuba. For breast cancer, a high-risk region was identified in municipalities of Ciudad de La Habana province (CAR-smoothed RR between 1.21 and 1.26). Cervical cancer exhibited two areas with excess risk in the east and extreme west of the island (CAR-smoothed RR range 1.2-2.01 both areas together). Clusters were confirmed only for cervical cancer (P = 0.001 for the most likely cluster and P = 0.003 for a secondary cluster). In conclusion, the study supports the hypothesis of a spatial variation in risk at small area level essentially for cervical cancer and also for breast cancer that probably reflects the territorial distribution of life style and socioeconomic factors. This is the first attempt to introduce this methodology in the framework of the National Cancer Registry of Cuba and we expect to extend its use to forthcoming analyses. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","<b>Dynamic associations in the cerebellar-motoneuron network during motor learning<\/b><br><br>We assessed here true causal directionalities in cerebellar-motoneuron (MN) network associations during the classical conditioning of eyelid responses. For this, the firing activities of identified facial MNs and cerebellar interpositus (IP) nucleus neurons were recorded during the acquisition of this type of associative learning in alert behaving cats. Simultaneously, the eyelid conditioned response (CR) and the EMG activity of the orbicularis oculi (OO) muscle were recorded. Nonlinear association analysis and time-dependent causality method allowed us to determine the asymmetry, time delays, direction in coupling, and functional interdependences between neuronal recordings and learned motor responses.Weconcluded that the functional nonlinear association between the IP neurons andOOmuscle activities was bidirectional and asymmetric, and the time delays in the two directions of coupling always lagged the start of the CR. Additionally, the strength of coupling depended inversely on the level of expression of eyeblink CRs, whereas causal inferences were significantly dependent on the phase information status. In contrast, the functional association between OO MNs and OO muscle activities was unidirectional and quasisymmetric, and the time delays in coupling were always of opposed signs. Moreover, information transfer in cerebellar-MN network associations during the learning process required a \"driving common source\" that induced the mere \"modulating coupling\" of the IP nucleus with the final common pathway for the eyelid motor system. Thus, it can be proposed that the cerebellum is always looking back and reevaluating its own function, using the information acquired in the process, to play a modulatingreinforcing role in motor learning.

Methods: Sixty two long-term, socially-excluded heroin injectors, not benefiting from available treatments were randomized to receive either DAM or MMT for 9 months in Granada, Spain. Completers were 44 and data at the end of the study period was obtained for 50. Participants were determined to be responders or non responders using a multi-domain outcome index accounting for their physical and mental health and psychosocial integration, used in a previous trial. Data was analyzed with Bayesian methods, using information from a similar study conducted in The Netherlands to select a priori distributions. On adding the data from the present study to update the a priori information, the distribution of the difference in response rates were obtained and used to build credibility intervals and relevant probability computations. Results: In the experimental group (n = 27), the rate of responders to treatment was 70.4% (95% CI 53.287.6), and in the control group (n = 23), it was 34.8% (95% CI 15.354.3). The probability of success in the experimental group using the a posteriori distributions was higher after a proper sensitivity analysis. Almost the whole distribution of the rates difference (the one for diacetylmorphine minus methadone) was located to the right of the zero, indicating the superiority of the experimental treatment. Conclusion: The present analysis suggests a clinical superiority of injectable diacetylmorphine compared to oral methadone in the treatment of severely affected heroin injectors not benefiting sufficiently from the available treatments. © 2009 Perea-Milla et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","<b>Treatment of advanced, recurrent, resistant to previous treatments basal and squamous cell skin carcinomas with a synergistic formulation of interferons. Open, prospective study<\/b><br><br>Background: Aggressive non-melanoma skin cancer (deeply infiltrating, recurrent, and morphea form lesions) are therapeutically challenging because they require considerable tissue loss and may demand radical disfiguring surgery. Interferons (IFN) may provide a non-surgical approach to the management of these tumors. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of a formulation containing IFNs-α and -γ in synergistic proportions on patients with recurrent, advanced basal cell (BCC) or squamous cell skin carcinomas (SCSC). Methods: Patients with extensive, recurrent, resistant to other procedures BCC or SCSC received the IFN formulation peri- and intralesionally, three times per week for 3 weeks. They had been previously treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Thirteen weeks after the end of treatment, the original lesion sites were examined for histological evidence of remaining tumor. Results: Sixteen elder (median 70 years-old) patients were included. They beared 12 BCC and 4 SCSC ranging from 1.5 to 12.5 cm in the longest dimension. At the end of treatment 47% CR (complete tumor elimination), 40% PR (>30% tumor reduction), and 13% stable disease were obtained. None of the patients relapsed during the treatment period. The median duration of the response was 38 months. Only one patient with complete response had relapsed until today. Principal adverse reactions were influenza-like symptoms well known to occur with interferon therapy, which were well tolerated. Conclusion: The peri- and intralesional combination of IFNs-α and -γ was safe and showed effect for the treatment of advanced, recurrent and resistant to previous treatments of BCC and SCSC in elder patients. This is the first report of such treatment in patients with advance non-melanoma skin cancer. The encouraging result justifies further confirmatory trials. © 2009 Anasagasti-Angulo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","<b>TNF- and IL-10 downregulation and marked oxidative stress in neuromyelitis optica<\/b><br><br>Background. Neuromyelitis optica is a central nervous system demyelinating and inflammatory syndrome. The objective of this study is to identify cytokines related to the cellular immune response as well as blood brain barrier integrity and oxidative stress. Methods. We performed a molecular characterization of cellular immune response and oxidative stress in serum from relapsing-NMO (R-NMO) patients and established the correlations between the clinical measurements and molecular parameters using the Bayesian approach. Serum samples from 11 patients with R-NMO diagnosed according to Wingerchuk criteria and matched in terms of age, gender and ethnicity with the healthy controls were analyzed. The levels of TNF-, IFN-, IL-10, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and oxidative stress markers: malondialdehyde, advanced oxidation protein products, peroxidation potential, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and total hydroperoxides were measured. Results. We found almost undetectable levels of TNF-, a decreased production of IL-10 and a significant up-regulation of every oxidative stress biomarker studied. The insufficient production of TNF- and IL-10 in R-NMO patients, which are two important players of T cell mediated immunoregulation, suggest an effector-regulator imbalance. The overproduction of oxygen reactive species as a consequence of the chronic inflammatory milieu is reflected on the excess of oxidative damage mediators detected. Furthermore, Multidimensional Scaling and a Bayesian linear regression model revealed a significant linear dependence between Expanded Disability Status Scale Kurtzke and TIMP-1; pointing to a possible predictive or prognostic value of this clinical-molecular relationship. Conclusion. These results suggest that there is a breakdown in immunoregulatory mechanisms and noteworthy pro-oxidant environment contributing to NMO pathogenesis. © 2009 Pentn-Rol et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","<b>Bayes's theorem and its use in diagnostic test lectures in clinical laboratory<\/b><br><br>empty","<b>Digital signal processing in the analysis of genomic sequences<\/b><br><br>Digital Signal Processing (DSP) applications in Bioinformatics have received great attention in recent years, where new effective methods for genomic sequence analysis, such as the detection of coding regions, have been developed. The use of DSP principles to analyze genomic sequences requires defining an adequate representation of the nucleotide bases by numerical values, converting the nucleotide sequences into time series. Once this has been done, all the mathematical tools usually employed in DSP are used in solving tasks such as identification of protein coding DNA regions, identification of reading frames, and others. In this article we present an overview of the most relevant applications of DSP algorithms in the analysis of genomic sequences, showing the main results obtained by using these techniques, analyzing their relative advantages and drawbacks, and providing relevant examples. We finally analyze some perspectives of DSP in Bioinformatics, considering recent research results on algebraic structures of the genetic code, which suggest other new DSP applications in this field, as well as the new field of Genomic Signal Processing. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","<b>The role of genetics in alcoholism.

This adds a degree of flexibility when fitting the model to actual data by accounting for un-modelled activity. We then show how the innovation method can be used to estimate unobserved metabolic/hemodynamic as well as vascular variables of the sMHM, from simulated and actual BOLD data. The proposed estimation method allowed for doing model comparison by calculating the model's AIC and BIC. This methodology was then used to select between different neurovascular coupling assumptions underlying sMHM. The proposed framework was first validated on simulations and then applied to BOLD data from a motor task experiment. The models under comparison in the analysis of the actual data considered that vascular response was coupled to: (I) inhibition, (II) excitation, (III) both excitation and inhibition. Data was best described by model II, although model III was also supported. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.","<b>Application of new statistical approach to study drug release from OCP coating on titanium sheets<\/b><br><br>In this study, commercially pure titanium (Ti-cp) discs were used as substrates.

Bayesian-regularized genetic neural networks (BRGNN): Application to the prediction of the antagonistic activity against human platelet thrombin receptor (PAR-1)<\/b><br><br>Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been widely used for medicinal chemistry modeling. In the last two decades, too many reports used MATLAB environment as an adequate platform for programming ANNs. Some of these reports comprise a variety of applications intended to quantitatively or qualitatively describe structure-activity relationships. A powerful tool is obtained when there are combined Bayesian-regularized neural networks (BRANNs) and genetic algorithm (GA): Bayesian-regularized genetic neural networks (BRGNNs). BRGNNs can model complicated relationships between explanatory variables and dependent variables. Thus, this methodology is regarded as useful tool for QSAR analysis. In order to demonstrate the use of BRGNNs, we developed a reliable method for predicting the antagonistic activity of 5-amino-3-arylisoxazole derivatives against Human Platelet Thrombin Receptor (PAR-1), using classical 3D-QSAR methodologies: Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) and Comparative Molecular Similarity Indices Analysis (CoMSIA). In addition, 3D vectors generated from the molecular structures were correlated with antagonistic activities by multivariate linear regression (MLR) and Bayesian-regularized neural networks (BRGNNs). All models were trained with 34 compounds, after which they were evaluated for predictive ability with additional 6 compounds. CoMFA and CoMSIA were unable to describe this structure-activity relationship, while BRGNN methodology brings the best results according to validation statistics. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","<b>Relevance vector machines for multivariate calibration purposes<\/b><br><br>The introduction of support vector regression (SVR) and least square support vector machines (LS-SVM) methods for regression purposes in the field of chemometrics has provided advantageous alternatives to the existing linear and nonlinear multivariate calibration (MVC) approaches. Relevance vector machines (RVMs) claim the advantages attributed to all the SVM-based methods over many other regression methods. Additionally, it also exhibits advantages over the standard SVM-based ones since: it is not necessary to estimate the error/margin trade-off parameter C and the insensitivity parameter ε in regression tasks, it is applicable to arbitrary basis functions, the algorithm gives probability estimates seamlessly and offer, additionally, excellent sparseness capabilities, which can result in a simple and robust model for the estimation of different properties. This paper presents the use of RVMs as a nonlinearMVC method capable of dealing with ill-posed problems. To study its behavior, three different chemometric benchmark datasets are considered, including both linear and non-linear solutions. RVM was compared with other calibration approaches reported in the literature. Although RVM performance is comparable with the best results obtained by LS-SVM, the final model achieved is sparser, so the prediction process is faster. Taking into account the other advantages attributed to RVMs, it can be concluded that this technique can be seen as a very promising option to solve nonlinear problems in MVC.

We demonstrate that simultaneous phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast DNA (matK and rbcL) and nonmolecular characters that include both extant genera and a limited number of fossil taxa provide useful hypotheses for calibrating molecular trees. Root placements varied for Pinaceae, with Bayesian analyses recovering mutually monophyletic subfamilies Pinoideae and Abietoideae and parsimony analyses recovering Abietoideae as paraphyletic by placing the root between Cedrus and the remaining genera. The inferred phylogenetic positions of fossil taxa Pityostrobus bernissartensis as the sister group to Pinus and Pseudolarix erensis as the sister group to extant Pseudolarix were used to guide divergence-time calibrations; these calibrations yielded an Early Cretaceous and an Early Jurassic age for crown-group Pinaceae, respectively. The older age estimates based on Pseudolarix erensis are supported by weaker evidence from the fossil record but are consistent with recent reports of Early Cretaceous leaf fossils that appear to coincide with extant genera. There remains a great need to characterize the anatomy of extant and fossil species and to code additional nonmolecular characters. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

Myocardial revascularization surgery Is the most common of heart surgeries.To know the prevalence of major adverse events in this surgery and their risk factors, 1264 patients that were consecutively revascularized were prospectively studied between January 1990 and January 1996 in the Cardiology Institute of Havana City. METHODS. A multivariate analysis of the risk variables was made. Bayes' probabilities were obtained. The statistical significance level was p < 0.05. RESULTS. Major events were reported In 398 cases (32.1 %). The most frequent events were surgical reIntervention (234; 18.9%) and low cardiac output (190; 15.0 %). Most of Bayes' positive probabilities for the appearance of adverse events behaved as follows: left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 % (probability: 66.2 %) and peripheral arterial vascular insufficiency (probability: 58.8 %) (preoperative); low cardiac output (probability: 82.3 %) and surgical accidents (probability: 73.1 %) (transoperative); non-sinusal rhythms (probability: 88.9 %) and use of four or more units of hemoderlvatives (probability: 59.6 %) (postoperative). CONCLUSIONS. The adverse events behaved according to the ranges reported at the International level.","<b>A Bayesian framework to identify principal intravoxel diffusion profiles based on diffusion-weighted MR imaging<\/b><br><br>In this paper we introduce a new method to characterize the intravoxel anisotropy based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The proposed solution, under a fully Bayesian formalism, deals with the problem of joint Bayesian Model selection and parameter estimation to reconstruct the principal diffusion profiles or primary fiber orientations in a voxel. We develop an efficient stochastic algorithm based on the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) method in order to perform the Bayesian computation. RJMCMC is a good choice for this problem because of its ability to jump between models of different dimensionality. This methodology provides posterior estimates of the parameters of interest (fiber orientation, diffusivities etc) unconditional of the model assumed. It also gives an empirical posterior distribution of the number of primary nerve fiber orientations given the DWI data. Different probability maps can be assessed using this methodology: 1) the intravoxel fiber orientation map (or orientational distribution function) that gives the probability of finding a fiber in a particular spatial orientation; 2) a three-dimensional map of the probability of finding a particular number of fibers in each voxel; 3) a three-dimensional MaxPro (maximum probability) map that provides the most probable number of fibers for each voxel. In order to study the performance and reliability of the presented approach, we tested it on synthetic data; an ex-vivo phantom of intersecting capillaries; and DWI data from a human subject. © 2008.","<b>Proteochemometric modeling of the inhibition complexes of matrix metalloproteinases with N-hydroxy-2-[(phenylsulfonyl)amino]acetamide derivatives using topological autocorrelation interaction matrix and model ensemble averaging<\/b><br><br>A target-ligand QSAR approach using autocorrelation formalism was developed for modeling the inhibitory potency (pIC50) toward matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13) of N-hydroxy-2-[(phenylsulfonyl)amino]acetamide derivatives. Target and ligand structural information was encoded in the Topological Autocorrelation Interaction matrix calculated from 2D topological representation of inhibitors and protein sequences. The relevant Topological Autocorrelation Interaction descriptors were selected by genetic algorithm-based multilinear regression analysis and Bayesian-regularized genetic neural network approaches. A model ensemble strategy was employed for achieving robust and reliable linear and non-linear predictors having nine topological autocorrelation interaction descriptors with square correlation coefficients of ensemble test-set fitting (R2test) about 0.80 and 0.87, respectively. Electrostatic and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity properties were the most relevant on the optimum models. In addition, the distribution of the inhibition complexes on a self-organized map depicted target dependence rather than an inhibitor similarity pattern. © 2008 The Authors.","<b>DEM: A variational treatment of dynamic systems<\/b><br><br>This paper presents a variational treatment of dynamic models that furnishes time-dependent conditional densities on the path or trajectory of a system's states and the time-independent densities of its parameters. These are obtained by maximising a variational action with respect to conditional densities, under a fixed-form assumption about their form. The action or path-integral of free-energy represents a lower bound on the model's log-evidence or marginal likelihood required for model selection and averaging. This approach rests on formulating the optimisation dynamically, in generalised coordinates of motion. The resulting scheme can be used for online Bayesian inversion of nonlinear dynamic causal models and is shown to outperform existing approaches, such as Kalman and particle filtering. Furthermore, it provides for dual and triple inferences on a system's states, parameters and hyperparameters using exactly the same principles. We refer to this approach as dynamic expectation maximisation (DEM). © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

QSAR models with considerable internal as well as external predictive ability were obtained. The relevant 2D autocorrelation descriptors for modeling CDK4/D inhibitory activity were selected by linear and nonlinear genetic algorithms (GAs) using multiple linear regression (MLR) and Bayesian-regularized genetic neural network (BRGNN) approaches, respectively. Both models showed good predictive statistics; but BRGNN model enables better external predictions. A weight-based input ranking scheme and Kohonen self-organized maps (SOMs) were carried out to interpret the final net weights. The 2D autocorrelation space brings different descriptors for CDK4/D inhibition, and suggests the atomic properties relevant for the inhibitors to interact with CDK4/D active site. CoMFA and CoMSIA analyses were developed with a focus on interpretative ability using coefficient contour maps. CoMSIA produced significantly better results. The results indicate a strong correlation between the inhibitory activity of the modeled compounds and the electrostatic and hydrophobic fields around them. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The key contribution is the automatic selection of multiple cortical sources with compact spatial support that are specified in terms of empirical priors. This obviates the need to use priors with a specific form (e.g., smoothness or minimum norm) or with spatial structure (e.g., priors based on depth constraints or functional magnetic resonance imaging results). Furthermore, the inversion scheme allows for a sparse solution for distributed sources, of the sort enforced by equivalent current dipole (ECD) models. This means the approach automatically selects either a sparse or a distributed model, depending on the data. The scheme is compared with conventional applications of Bayesian solutions to quantify the improvement in performance. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Using a Bayesian framework the probability of finding a fiber in a specific orientation is obtained. The proposed ODF estimation relies on a cigar-like diffusion tensor model, the methodology is thus denominated Bayesian cigar-like diffusion tensor (BCDT). This work makes two major contributions: 1) the study of single-fiber models in detecting fibers with different volume fractions in a voxel, and 2) the introduction of the Nth-root correction to improve the detection of fibers with smaller volume fractions, where N is the number of diffusion MRI measurements. It is demonstrated that the incomplete signal modeling fails to reconstruct the relative fiber volume fractions, especially when the intravoxel diffusion profiles have dissimilar contributions to the diffusion MRI signal. In this situation the fibers with smaller contributions are hardly detectable. The BCDT method proposed here reduces this effect by introducing the Nth-root correction, making multiple fibers estimable. The performance of the new methodology is illustrated using synthetic and real data, as well as the data from a phantom of intersecting capillaries. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","<b>MMM-QSAR recognition of ribonucleases without alignment: Comparison with an HMM model and isolation from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, prediction, and experimental assay of a new sequence<\/b><br><br>The study of type III RNases constitutes an important area in molecular biology. It is known that the pac1+ gene encodes a particular RNase III that shares low amino acid similarity with other genes despite having a double-stranded ribonuclease activity. Bioinformatics memods based on sequence alignment may fail when there is a low amino acidic identity percentage between a query sequence and others with similar functions (remote homologues) or a similar sequence is not recorded in the database. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) applied to protein sequences may allow an alignment-independent prediction of protein function. These sequences of QS AR-like methods often use 1D sequence numerical parameters as the input to seek sequence-function relationships. However, previous 2D representation of sequences may uncover useful higher-order information. In the work described here we calculated for the first time the spectral moments of a Markov matrix (MMM) associated with a 2D-HP-map of a protein sequence. We used MMMs values to characterize numerically 81 sequences of type III RNases and 133 proteins of a control group. We subsequently developed one MMM-QSAR and one classic hidden Markov model (HMM) based on the same data. The MMM-QSAR showed a discrimination power of RNAses from other proteins of 97.35% without using alignment, which is a result as good as for the known HMM techniques. We also report for the first time the isolation of a new Pac1 protein (DQ647826) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe strain 428-4-1. The MMM-QSAR model predicts the new RNase III with the same accuracy as other classical alignment methods. Experimental assay of this protein confirms me predicted activity. The present results suggest that MMM-QSAR models may be used for protein function annotation avoiding sequence alignment with the same accuracy of classic HMM models. © 2008 American Chemical Society.","<b>Bayesian M/EEG source reconstruction with spatio-temporal priors<\/b><br><br>This article proposes a Bayesian spatio-temporal model for source reconstruction of M/EEG data. The usual two-level probabilistic model implicit in most distributed source solutions is extended by adding a third level which describes the temporal evolution of neuronal current sources using time-domain General Linear Models (GLMs). These comprise a set of temporal basis functions which are used to describe event-related M/EEG responses. This places M/EEG analysis in a statistical framework that is very similar to that used for PET and fMRI. The experimental design can be coded in a design matrix, effects of interest characterized using contrasts and inferences made using posterior probability maps. Importantly, as is the case for single-subject fMRI analysis, trials are treated as fixed effects and the approach takes into account between-trial variance, allowing valid inferences to be made on single-subject data. The proposed probabilistic model is efficiently inverted by using the Variational Bayes framework under a convenient mean-field approximation (VB-GLM).

Such a task can be accomplished by a Bayesian network. The dark side is that, when lots of variables are involved, the learning of the network slows down and may lead to wrong results. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of applying an existing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based approach to feature selection for filtering the irrelevant attributes of the dataset, resulting in a fine Bayesian network built with the K2 algorithm. Empirical tests carried out with real data coming from the bioinformatics domain bear out that the PSO fitness function is in a straight concordance to the most widely known validation measures for classification. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.","<b>Diffusion-based spatial priors for imaging<\/b><br><br>We describe a Bayesian scheme to analyze images, which uses spatial priors encoded by a diffusion kernel, based on a weighted graph Laplacian. This provides a general framework to formulate a spatial model, whose parameters can be optimized. The application we have in mind is a spatiotemporal model for imaging data. We illustrate the method on a random effects analysis of fMRI contrast images from multiple subjects; this simplifies exposition of the model and enables a clear description of its salient features. Typically, imaging data are smoothed using a fixed Gaussian kernel as a pre-processing step before applying a mass-univariate statistical model (e.g., a general linear model) to provide images of parameter estimates. An alternative is to include smoothness in a multivariate statistical model (Penny, W.D., Trujillo-Barreto, N.J., Friston, K.J., 2005. Bayesian fMRI time series analysis with spatial priors. Neuroimage 24, 350-362). The advantage of the latter is that each parameter field is smoothed automatically, according to a measure of uncertainty, given the data. In this work, we investigate the use of diffusion kernels to encode spatial correlations among parameter estimates. Nonlinear diffusion has a long history in image processing; in particular, flows that depend on local image geometry (Romeny, B.M.T., 1994. Geometry-driven Diffusion in Computer Vision. Kluwer Academic Publishers) can be used as adaptive filters. This can furnish a non-stationary smoothing process that preserves features, which would otherwise be lost with a fixed Gaussian kernel. We describe a Bayesian framework that incorporates non-stationary, adaptive smoothing into a generative model to extract spatial features in parameter estimates. Critically, this means adaptive smoothing becomes an integral part of estimation and inference. We illustrate the method using synthetic and real fMRI data. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Autocorrelation vector formalism was extended to amino acid sequences and 3D conformations for encoding protein structural information with modeling purpose. Protein autocorrelation vectors were weighted by 48 amino acid/residue properties selected from the AAindex database. Ensembles of Bayesian-regularized genetic neural networks (BRGNNs) trained with amino acid sequence autocorrelation (AASA) vectors and amino acid 3D autocorrelation (AA3DA) vectors yielded predictive models of the change of unfolding Gibbs free energy change (G) of chymotrypsin Inhibitor 2 protein mutants. The ensemble predictor described about 58 and 72% of the data variances in test sets for AASA and AA3DA models, respectively.

The molecular information has been encoded in 2D autocorrelation descriptors, obtained from different weighting schemes. The linear models were built by multiple linear regression (MLR) combined with genetic algorithm (GA), and a robust QSAR mapping paradigm. The Bayesian-regularized genetic neural network (BRGNN) was employed for nonlinear modeling. In such approaches each model could have its own set of input variables. All models were predictive according to internal and external validation experiments; but the best results correspond to nonlinear ones. The 2D autocorrelation space brings different descriptors for each MMP inhibition, and suggests the atomic properties relevant for the inhibitors to interact with each MMP active site. On the basis of the current results, the reported models have the potential to discover new potent and selective inhibitors and bring useful molecular information about the ligand specificity for MMP S1′ and S2′ subsites. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

II: From data to neuronal masses<\/b><br><br>In the companion article a local electrovascular coupling (LEVC) model was proposed to explain the continuous dynamics of electrical and vascular states within a cortical unit. These states produce certain mesoscopic reflections whose discrete time series can be reconstructed from electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this article we develop a recursive optimization algorithm based on the local linearization (LL) filter and an innovation method to make statistical inferences about the LEVC model from both EEG and fMRI data, i.e., to estimate the unobserved states and the unknown parameters of the model. For a better understanding, the LL filter is described from a Bayesian point of view, providing the particulars for the case of hybrid data (e.g., EEG and fMRI), which could be sampled at different rates. The dynamics of the exogenous synaptic inputs going into the cortical unit are also estimated by introducing a set of Gaussian radial basis functions. In order to study the dynamics of the electrical and vascular states in the striate cortex of humans as well as their local interrelationships, we applied this algorithm to EEG and fMRI recordings obtained concurrently from two subjects while passively observing a radial checkerboard with a white/black pattern reversal. The EEG and fMRI data from the first subject was used to estimate the electrical/vascular states and parameters of the LEVC model in Vl for a 4.0 Hz reversion frequency. We used the EEG data from the second subject to investigate the changes in the dynamics of the electrical states when the frequency of reversion is varied from 0.5-4.0 Hz. Then we made use of the estimated electrical states to predict the effects on the vasculature that such variations produce. © Wiley-Liss, Inc.","<b>QSAR models for predicting the activity of non-peptide luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonists derived from erythromycin A using quantum chemical properties<\/b><br><br>Multiple linear regression (MLR) combined with genetic algorithm (GA) and Bayesian-regularized Genetic Neural Networks (BRGNNs) were used to model the binding affinity (pKI) of 38 11,12-cyclic carbamate derivatives of 6-O-methylerythromycin A for the Human Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone (LHRH) receptor using quantum chemical descriptors. A multiparametric MLR equation with good statistical quality was obtained that describes the features relevant for antagonistic activity when the substituent at the position 3 of the erythronolide core was varied. In addition, four-descriptor linear and nonlinear models were established for the whole dataset. Such models showed high statistical quality. However, the BRGNN model was better than the linear model according to the external validation process. In general, our linear and nonlinear models reveal that the binding affinity of the compounds studied for the LHRH receptor is modulated by electron-related terms. © Springer-Verlag 2007.","<b>Two approaches to generate intelligent teaching-learning systems using artificial intelligence techniques<\/b><br><br>The use of present pedagogical methods with Information and Communication Technologies produce a new quality that favors the task of generating, transmitting and sharing knowledge.

The optimal labeling corresponds to the configuration that minimizes an energy functional derived from a MRF probabilistic model, that introduces contextual knowledge about the shape of roads. We formulate an energy function modeling the interactions between road segments, while satisfying the regularity conditions required by the graph cuts based minimization.

In such Boolean structures, deductions have physico-chemical meaning. We summarize here that these algebraic structures can help us to describe the gene evolution process. Particularly in the experimental confrontation, it was found that most of the mutations of several proteins correspond to deductions in these algebras and they have a small Hamming distance related to their respective wild type. Two applications of the corresponding codification system in bioinformatics problems are also shown. The first one is the classification of mutations in a protein. The other one is related with the problem of detecting donors and acceptors in DNA sequences.

This is relevant when using the free energy as an approximation to the log-evidence in Bayesian model averaging and selection. By setting restricted maximum likelihood (ReML) in the larger context of variational learning and expectation maximisation (EM), we show how the ReML objective function can be adjusted to provide an approximation to the log-evidence for a particular model. This means ReML can be used for model selection, specifically to select or compare models with different covariance components. This is useful in the context of hierarchical models because it enables a principled selection of priors that, under simple hyperpriors, can be used for automatic model selection and relevance determination (ARD). Deriving the ReML objective function, from basic variational principles, discloses the simple relationships among Variational Bayes, EM and ReML. Furthermore, we show that EM is formally identical to a full variational treatment when the precisions are linear in the hyperparameters. Finally, we also consider, briefly, dynamic models and how these inform the regularisation of free energy ascent schemes, like EM and ReML. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In other respects, the ability of the nonlinear selected GA space for differentiating the data was evidenced when the total data set was well distributed in a Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM).

For multidetermination applications, the normal choice is an array of potentiometric sensors to generate the signal, and an artificial neural network (ANN) correctly trained to obtain the calibration model. As a great amount of information is required for the proper modelling, we proposed its automated generation by using the sequential injection analysis (SIA) technique. First signals used were steady-state: the equilibrium signal after a step-change in concentration. We have now adapted our procedures to record the transient response corresponding to a sample step. The novelty in this approach is therefore the use of the dynamic components of the signal in order to better discriminate or differentiate a sample. In the developed electronic tongue systems, detection is carried out by using a sensor array formed by five potentiometric sensors based on PVC membranes. For the developed application we employed two different chloride-selective sensors, two nitrate-selective sensors and one generic response sensor. As the amount of raw data (fivefold recordings corresponding to the five sensors) is excessive for an ANN, some feature extraction step prior to the modelling was needed. In order to attain substantial data reduction and noise filtering, the data obtained were fitted with orthonormal Legendre polynomials. In this case, a third-degree Legendre polynomial was shown to be sufficient to fit the data. The coefficients of these polynomials were the input information fed into the ANN used to model the concentrations of the determined species (Cl-, NO3 - and HCO3-). Best results were obtained by using a backpropagation neural network trained with the Bayesian regularisation algorithm; the net had a single hidden layer containing three neurons with the tansig transfer function. The results obtained from the time-dependent response were compared with those obtained from steady-state conditions, showing the former superior performance. Finally, the method was applied for determining anions in synthetic samples and real water samples, where a satisfactory comparison was also achieved.

The prevalence of non-specific low back pain is very high among the general population, and 60-70% of adults are believed to have suffered this problem at some time. Nevertheless, few randomised clinical trials have been made of the efficacy and efficiency of acupuncture with respect to acute low back pain. The present study is intended to assess the efficacy of acupuncture for acute low back pain in terms of the improvement reported on the Roland Morris Questionnaire (RMQ) on low back pain incapacity, to estimate the specific and non-specific effects produced by the technique, and to carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis. Methods/Design: Randomised four-branch controlled multicentre prospective study made to compare semi-standardised real acupuncture, sham acupuncture (acupuncture at non-specific points), placebo acupuncture and conventional treatment. The patients are blinded to the real, sham and placebo acupuncture treatments. Patients in the sample present symptoms of non specific acute low back pain, with a case history of 2 weeks or less, and will be selected from working-age patients, whether in paid employment or not, referred by General Practitioners from Primary Healthcare Clinics to the four clinics participating in this study. In order to assess the primary and secondary result measures, the patients will be requested to fill in a questionnaire before the randomisation and again at 3, 12 and 48 weeks after starting the treatment. The primary result measure will be the clinical relevant improvement (CRI) at 3 weeks after randomisation. We define CRI as a reduction of 35% or more in the RMQ results. Discussion: This study is intended to obtain further evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture on acute low back pain and to isolate the specific and non-specific effects of the treatment. © 2006 Vas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","<b>A theoretical formulation of the electrophysiological inverse problem on the sphere<\/b><br><br>The construction of three-dimensional images of the primary current density (PCD) produced by neuronal activity is a problem of great current interest in the neuroimaging community, though being initially formulated in the 1970s. There exist even now enthusiastic debates about the authenticity of most of the inverse solutions proposed in the literature, in which low resolution electrical tomography (LORETA) is a focus of attention. However, in our opinion, the capabilities and limitations of the electro and magneto encephalographic techniques to determine PCD configurations have not been extensively explored from a theoretical framework, even for simple volume conductor models of the head. In this paper, the electrophysiological inverse problem for the spherical head model is cast in terms of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) formalism, which allows us to identify the null spaces of the implicated linear integral operators and also to define their representers. The PCD are described in terms of a continuous basis for the RKHS, which explicitly separates the harmonic and non-harmonic components. The RKHS concept permits us to bring LORETA into the scope of the general smoothing splines theory. A particular way of calculating the general smoothing splines is illustrated, avoiding a brute force discretization prematurely. The Bayes information criterion is used to handle dissimilarities in the signal/noise ratios and physical dimensions of the measurement modalities, which could affect the estimation of the amount of smoothness required for that class of inverse solution to be well specified. In order to validate the proposed method, we have estimated the 3D spherical smoothing splines from two data sets: electric potentials obtained from a skull phantom and magnetic fields recorded from subjects performing an experiment of human faces recognition. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.","<b>Amino acid sequence autocorrelation vectors and ensembles of bayesian-regularized genetic neural networks for prediction of conformational stability of human lysozyme mutants<\/b><br><br>Development of novel computational approaches for modeling protein properties from their primary structure is a main goal in applied proteomics.

As a preliminary step, linear dependences were established by multiple linear regression (MLR) approaches, selecting the relevant descriptors by genetic algorithm (GA) feature selection. For ANN models non-linear GA feature selection was also applied. Non-linear modeling of Ki overcame the results of the linear one using four properties, keeping in mind standard Pearson R correlation coefficients (0.931 vs. 0.862) and leave one out (LOO) cross-validation analysis (QLOO2=0.703vs.0.510). On the other hand, IC90 modeling was insoluble by a linear approach: no predictive model was achieved; however, a non-linear relation was encountered according to statistic results (R = 0.891; QLOO2=0.568). The best non-linear models suggested the influence of the presence of nitrogen atoms and the molecular volume distribution in the inhibitor structures on the HIV-1 protease inhibition as well as that the inhibition of HIV replication was dependent on the occurrence of five-member rings. Finally, inhibitors were well distributed regarding its activity levels in a Kohonen self-organizing map built using the input variables of the best non-linear models. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A linear model was unable to successfully fit the whole data set; however, the optimum Bayesian regularized neural network model described about 87% inhibitory activity variance with a relevant predictive power measured by q2 values of leave-one-out and leave-group-out cross-validations of about 0.7. According to their activity levels, thiol and non-thiol inhibitors were well-distributed in a topological map, built with the inputs of the optimum non-linear predictor. Furthermore, descriptors in the GNN model suggested the occurrence of a strong dependence of FT inhibition on the molecular shape and size rather than on electronegativity or polarizability characteristics of the studied compounds. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Importantly, we use a spatial prior on regression coefficients which embodies our prior knowledge that evoked responses are spatially contiguous and locally homogeneous. Further, using a computationally efficient Variational Bayes framework, we are able to let the data determine the optimal amount of smoothing. We assume an arbitrary order Auto-Regressive (AR) model for the errors. Our model generalizes earlier work on voxel-wise estimation of GLM-AR models and inference in GLMs using Posterior Probability Maps (PPMs).

A neural network monitoring scheme evidenced a highly non-linear dependence between the IKCa blocking activity and TCI descriptors. Suitable subsets of descriptors were selected by means of genetic algorithm. Bayesian regularization was implemented in the network training function with the aim of assuring good generalization qualities to the predictors. GNNs were able to yield a reliable predictor that explained about 97% data variance with good predictive ability. On the contrary, the best multivariate linear equation with descriptors selected by linear genetic search, only explained about 60%. In spite of when using the descriptors from the linear equations to train neural networks yielded higher fitted models, such networks were very unstable and had relative low predictive ability. However, the best GNN BRANN 2 had a Q2 of LOO of cross-validation equal to 0.901 and at the same time exhibited outstanding stability when calculating 80 randomly constructed training/ test sets partitions. Our model suggested that structural fragments of size three and seven have relevant influence on the inhibitory potency of the studied IKCa channel blockers. Furthermore, inhibitors were well distributed regarding its activity levels in a Kohonen self-organizing map (KSOM) built using the inputs of the best neural network predictor. © Springer 2005.","<b>Modeling of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition by 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d] pyrimidine derivatives using artificial neural network ensembles<\/b><br><br>Artificial neural network ensembles were used for modeling the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition of 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives. The structural characteristics of these inhibitors were encoded in relevant 3D-spatial descriptors extracted by genetic algorithm feature selection. Bayesian-regularized multilayer neural networks, trained by the back-propagation algorithm, were developed using these variables as inputs. The predictive power of the model was tested by leave-one-out cross validation. In addition, for a more rigorous measure of the predictive capacity, multiple validation sets were randomly generated as members of neural network ensembles, which makes doing averaged predictions feasible. In this way, the predictive power was analyzed accounting for the averaged test set R values and test set mean-square errors. Otherwise, Kohonen self-organizing maps were used as an additional tool for the same modeling. The location of the inhibitors in a map facilitates the analysis of the connection between compounds and serves as a useful tool for qualitative predictions. © 2005 American Chemical Society.","<b>Spatio-temporal autoregressive models defined over brain manifolds<\/b><br><br>Multivariate Autoregressive time series models (MAR) are an increasingly used tool for exploring functional connectivity in Neuroimaging. They provide the framework for analyzing the Granger Causality of a given brain region on others. In this article, we shall limit our attention to linear MAR models, in which a set of matrices of autoregressive coefficients Ak (k = 1 , . . .,p) describe the dependence of present values of the image on lagged values of its past. Methods for estimating the Ak and determining which elements that are zero are well-known and are the basis for directed measures of influence. However, to date, MAR models are limited in the number of time series they can handle, forcing the a priori selection of a (small) number of voxels or regions of interest for analysis. This ignores the full spatio-temporal nature of functional brain data which are, in fact, collections of time series sampled over an underlying continuous spatial manifold-the brain. A fully spatio-temporal MAR model (ST-MAR) is developed within the framework of functional data analysis. For spatial data, each row of a matrix Ak is the influence field of a given voxel. A Bayesian ST-MAR model is specified in which the influence fields for all voxels are required to vary smoothly over space. This requirement is enforced by penalizing the spatial roughness of the influence fields. This roughness is calculated with a discrete version of the spatial Laplacian operator. A massive reduction in dimensionality of computations is achieved via the singular value decomposition, making an interactive exploration of the model feasible. Use of the model is illustrated with an fMRI time series that was gathered concurrently with EEG in order to analyze the origin of resting brain rhythms. Copyright ©Humana Press Inc.

However, allopatric speciation may also occur in such situations, especially when ranges are fragmented by fluctuating water levels. We test the hypothesis that Miocene fragmentation of Cuba into three palaeo-archipelagos accompanied species-level divergence in the adaptive radiation of West Indian Anolis lizards. Analysis of morphology, mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) and nuclear DNA in the Cuban green anoles (carolinensis subgroup) strongly supports three predictions made by this hypothesis. First, three geographical sets of populations, whose ranges correspond with palaeo-archipelago boundaries, are distinct and warrant recognition as independent evolutionary lineages or species. Coalescence of nuclear sequence fragments sampled from these species and the large divergences observed between their mtDNA haplotypes suggest separation prior to the subsequent unification of Cuba ca. 5 Myr ago. Second, molecular phylogenetic relationships among these species reflect historical geographical relationships rather than morphological similarity. Third, all three species remain distinct despite extensive geographical contact subsequent to island unification, occasional hybridization and introgression of mtDNA haplotypes. Allopatric speciation initiated during partial island submergence may play an important role in speciation during the adaptive radiation of Anolis lizards. © 2004 The Royal Society.","<b>Metacommunity process rather than continental tectonic history better explains geographically structured phylogenies in legumes<\/b><br><br>Penalized likelihood estimated ages of both densely sampled intracontinental and sparsely sampled transcontinental crown clades in the legume family show a mostly Quaternary to Neogene age distribution. The mode ages of the intracontinental crown clades range from 4-6 Myr ago, whereas those of the transcontinental crown clades range from 8-16 Myr ago. Both of these young age estimates are detected despite methodological approaches that bias results toward older ages. Hypotheses that resort to vicariance or continental history to explain continental disjunct distributions are dismissed because they require mostly Palaeogene and older tectonic events. An alternative explanation centring on dispersal that may well explain the geographical as well as the ecological phylogenetic structure of legume phylogenies is Hubbell's unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography. This is the only dispersalist theory that encompasses evolutionary time and makes predictions about phylogenetic structure.","<b>Genetic variation increases during biological invasion by a Cuban lizard<\/b><br><br>A genetic paradox exists in invasion biology: how do introduced populations, whose genetic variation has probably been depleted by population bottlenecks, persist and adapt to new conditions? Lessons from conservation genetics show that reduced genetic variation due to genetic drift and founder effects limits the ability of a population to adapt, and small population size increases the risk of extinction. Nonetheless, many introduced species experiencing these same conditions during initial introductions persist, expand their ranges, evolve rapidly and become invasive. To address this issue, we studied the brown anole, a worldwide invasive lizard. Genetic analyses indicate that at least eight introductions have occurred in Florida from across this lizard's native range, blending genetic variation from different geographic source populations and producing populations that contain substantially more, not less, genetic variation than native populations. Moreover, recently introduced brown anole populations around the world originate from Florida, and some have maintained these elevated levels of genetic variation. Here we show that one key to invasion success may be the occurrence of multiple introductions that transform among-population variation in native ranges to within-population variation in introduced areas. Furthermore, these genetically variable populations may be particularly potent sources for introductions elsewhere. The growing problem of invasive species introductions brings considerable economic and biological costs. If these costs are to be mitigated, a greater understanding of the causes, progression and consequences of biological invasions is needed.","<b>Recursive Penalized Least Squares Solution for Dynamical Inverse Problems of EEG Generation<\/b><br><br>In the dynamical inverse problem of electroencephalogram (EEG) generation where a specific dynamics for the electrical current distribution is assumed, we can impose general spatiotemporal constraints onto the solution by casting the problem into a state space representation and assuming a specific class of parametric models for the dynamics. The Akaike Bayesian Information Criterion (ABIC), which is based on the Type II likelihood, was used to estimate the parameters and evaluate the model. In addition, dynamic low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), a new approach for estimating the current distribution is introduced. A recursive penalized least squares (RPLS) step forms the main element of our implementation. To obtain improved inverse solutions, dynamic LORETA exploits both spatial and temporal information, whereas LORETA uses only spatial information. A considerable improvement in performance compared to LORETA was found when dynamic LORETA was applied to simulated EEG data, and the new method was applied also to clinical EEG data. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","<b>Bayesian model averaging in EEG/MEG imaging<\/b><br><br>In this paper, the Bayesian Theory is used to formulate the Inverse Problem (IP) of the EEG/MEG. This formulation offers a comparison framework for the wide range of inverse methods available and allows us to address the problem of model uncertainty that arises when dealing with different solutions for a single data. In this case, each model is defined by the set of assumptions of the inverse method used, as well as by the functional dependence between the data and the Primary Current Density (PCD) inside the brain. The key point is that the Bayesian Theory not only provides for posterior estimates of the parameters of interest (the PCD) for a given model, but also gives the possibility of finding posterior expected utilities unconditional on the models assumed. In the present work, this is achieved by considering a third level of inference that has been systematically omitted by previous Bayesian formulations of the IP. This level is known as Bayesian model averaging (BMA). The new approach is illustrated in the case of considering different anatomical constraints for solving the IP of the EEG in the frequency domain. This methodology allows us to address two of the main problems that affect linear inverse solutions (LIS): (a) the existence of ghost sources and (b) the tendency to underestimate deep activity. Both simulated and real experimental data are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the BMA approach, and some of the results are compared with the solutions obtained using the popular low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) and its anatomically constraint version (cLORETA). © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Cerebrovascular disease causes different cognitive alterations. There is a need to develop tools that are capable of diagnosing them. One of them could be event-related potentials. These provide an indicator of cognitive processing in real time. Patients and methods. A study was conducted of 10 patients with cerebral infarction in the frontal region and 10 paired healthy controls. Evaluation of the patients was performed a week after the stroke. A continuous performance test was applied to both groups together with the recording of the electrical activity in the brain in order to obtain the P300 component. The results were submitted to the non-parametric Student's t test, and the Bayesian model averaging method (BMAM) was employed to calculate the sources generating the electrical activity recorded on the electroencephalogram. Results. Patients displayed significantly poorer performances compared to the healthy controls in the attention test. The BMAM showed that the P300 component was related to the right-hand temporal structures in healthy controls, whereas the left temporoparietal regions were also involved in the patients. Conclusions. These findings indicate the existence of subclinical disorders affecting sustained attention and that they can only be detected by very sensitive tools; furthermore, they also have implications for the brain circuits regulating sustained attention and the P300 component.","<b>DNA microsatellite variability and genetic differentiation among natural populations of the Cuban white shrimp Litopenaeus schmitti<\/b><br><br>Genetic variability within the Cuban population of the white shrimp Litopenaeus schmitti (Burkenroad, 1936) was assessed using five microsatellite loci and samples collected from four sites (Batabanó, Cienfuegos, Tunas de Zaza, and Manzanillo) from November 1999 to March 2000. All loci were polymorphic, and a total of 80 alleles were found, 13 of them private alleles occurring only in a single population and always in low frequencies. The Cienfuegos sample had the highest observed heterozygosity (Ho = 0.653), and the Tunas de Zaza sample had the lowest values (Ho = 0.605), but there were no significant differences among samples in heterozygosity or in the mean numbers of alleles per locus (ranging from 11.0 to 11.6). Significant differentiation among populations was detected (F ST = 0.012, P < 0.001). Low but significant FST values were revealed in pairwise comparisons between populations. Assignation tests correctly assigned high percentages of individuals to their original populations (74.5%) using a Bayesian approach. The significant differentiation among populations could be due to the restriction of gene flow among populations of L. schmitti and is concordant with previous allozyme studies on Cuban populations.","<b>Tests of statistical significance in three biomedical journals: A critical review<\/b><br><br>Objective. To describe the use of conventional tests of statistical significance and the current trends shown by their use in three biomedical journals read in Spanish-speaking countries. Methods. All descriptive or explanatory original articles published in the five-year period of 1996 through 2000 were reviewed in three journals: Revista Cubana de Medicina General Integral [Cuban Journal of Comprehensive General Medicine], Revista Panamericana de Salud Pública/Pan American Journal of Public Health, and Medicina Clínica [Clinical Medicine] (which is published in Spain). Results. In the three journals that were reviewed various shortcomings were found in their use of hypothesis tests based on P values and in the limited use of new tools that have been suggested for use in their place: confidence intervals (CIs) and Bayesian inference. The basic findings of our research were: minimal use of CIs, as either a complement to significance tests or as the only statistical tool; mentions of a small sample size as a possible explanation for the lack of statistical significance; a predominant use of rigid alpha values; a lack of uniformity in the presentation of results; and improper reference in the research conclusions to the results of hypothesis tests. Conclusions. Our results indicate the lack of compliance by authors and editors with accepted standards for the use of tests of statistical significance. The findings also highlight that the stagnant use of these tests continues to be a common practice in the scientific literature.","<b>A state-space model of the hemodynamic approach: Nonlinear filtering of BOLD signals<\/b><br><br>In this paper, a new procedure is presented which allows the estimation of the states and parameters of the hemodynamic approach from blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses. The proposed method constitutes an alternative to the recently proposed Friston [Neuroimage 16 (2002) 513] method and has some advantages over it. The procedure is based on recent groundbreaking time series analysis techniques that have been, in this case, adopted to characterize hemodynamic responses in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This work represents a fundamental improvement over existing approaches to system identification using nonlinear hemodynamic models and is important for three reasons. First, our model includes physiological noise. Previous models have been based upon ordinary differential equations that only allow for noise or error to enter at the level of observation. Secondly, by using the innovation method and the local linearization filter, not only the parameters, but also the underlying states of the system generating responses can be estimated. These states can include things like a flow-inducing signal triggered by neuronal activation, de-oxyhemoglobine, cerebral blood flow and volume. Finally, radial basis functions have been introduced as a parametric model to represent arbitrary temporal input sequences in the hemodynamic approach, which could be essential to understanding those brain areas indirectly related to the stimulus. Hence, thirdly, by inferring about the radial basis parameters, we are able to perform a blind deconvolution, which permits both the reconstruction of the dynamics of the most likely hemodynamic states and also, to implicitly reconstruct the underlying synaptic dynamics, induced experimentally, which caused these states variations. From this study, we conclude that in spite of the utility of the standard discrete convolution approach used in statistical parametric maps (SPM), nonlinear BOLD phenomena and unspecific input temporal sequences must be included in the fMRI analysis. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

To estimate the yearly number of people in Cuba who are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and were infected through sexual contact but who have not developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Estimation was made directly from the yearly HIV seroprevalence data of the Cuban Partner Notification Programme from 1991 to 2000. Methods. The generalized removal model for open populations is utilized for the estimation. The total number of known HIV-infected Cubans at each sampling time is used in the prior to provide more reasonable approximations. Results. We estimated a yearly survival rate of 93%. The median estimates for the number of all living asymptomatic HIV-positive Cubans, infected by sexual contact, tripled from 714 in 1991 to 2170 in 2000. The number of unknown HIV-positive Cubans infected sexually is estimated to range from 174 in 1991 to 401 in 2000. Conclusions. A consistent increase in the number of sexually infected HIV-positive individuals in Cuba from 1991 to 2000 is evident from the estimates. From 1996 onwards more sexually active homosexual/bisexual contacts were traced and consequently more sexually-infected HIV-positives were detected. A consequence of increased detection is the levelling off and subsequent decrease in the number of unknown HIV-positives during this time period. The estimation procedure is useful in estimating prevalent population sizes of epidemiological and public health interest.","<b>Cáncer de piel y ocupación<\/b><br><br>It is known that skin cancer is the most frequent in men.

Sun exposure is considered as the main carcinogen, since this risk factor is present in the occupation of the individual, without forgetting the diversity of known industrial carcinogens and the multifactorial etiology of this disease. A review of the topic is made to stress the force of association of the occupational risk and the participation of other risk factors depending on individuality, environment (non occupational sun exposure) and lifestyle from an occupational point of view to have better causal inferences in the epidemiological surveillance of the disease.","<b>The Bayesian approach: another way of drawing inferences<\/b><br><br>The serious objections made with regard to significance tests account for the necessity of employing another inferential procedure.

Bayesian methods offer more information and are more useful than conventional ones for analyzing experimental outcomes. In addition, a natural interpretation of conclusions are given by Bayesian methods. Finally, modern computational programs allow us to solve their complex calculation.","<b>Adaptive model-based technique for robust speech recognition<\/b><br><br>This paper presents an algorithm for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the noise hidden Markov model (HMM) parameters in the context of model-based techniques.

(1976) and Zetterberg et al. (1978) is fitted to actual EEG data. This is achieved by reformulating the original set of integral equations as a continuous-discrete state space model. The local linearization approach is then used to discretize the state equation and to construct a nonlinear Kalman filter. On this basis, a maximum likelihood procedure is used for estimating the model parameters for several EEG recordings. The analysis of the noise-free differential equations of the estimated models suggests that there are two different types of alpha rhythms: those with a point attractor and others with a limit cycle attractor. These attractors are also found by means of a nonlinear time series analysis of the EEG recordings. We conclude that the Hopf bifurcation described by Zetterberg et al. (1978) is present in actual brain dynamics.","<b>La perspectiva exploratorio-confirmatoria en las aplicaciones biomédicas de la estadística: Dos diálogos (I).

this study, we want to explore evidence for the causal relationship between the anatomical descriptors of the cingulate cortex (surface area, mean curvature-corrected thickness, and volume) and the performance of cognitive tasks such as Card Sort, Flanker, List Sort used as instruments to measure the executive functions of flexibility, inhibitory control, and working memory. We have performed this analysis in a cross-sectional sample of 899 healthy young subjects of the Human Connectome Project. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using causal inference to explain the relationship between cingulate morphology and the performance of executive tasks in healthy subjects. We have tested the causal model under a counterfactual framework using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting and marginal structural models. The results showed that the posterior cingulate surface area has a positive causal effect on inhibition (Flanker task) and cognitive flexibility (Card Sort). A unit increase (+1 mm2) in the posterior cingulate surface area will cause a 0.008% and 0.009% increase from the National Institute of Health (NIH) normative mean in Flankers (p-value <0.001), and Card Sort (p-value 0.005), respectively. Furthermore, a unit increase (+1 mm2) in the anterior cingulate surface area will cause a 0.004% (p-value <0.001) and 0.005% (p-value 0.001) increase from the NIH normative mean in Flankers and Card Sort. In contrast, the curvature-corrected-mean thickness only showed an association for anterior cingulate with List Sort (p = 0.034) but no causal effect. © 2022 The Authors.

Clearly, the success of such an endeavor will depend on the amount of information that the patient-specific variables convey about the individual causal treatment effect on the response of interest. In the present work, using causal inference and information theory, a strategy is proposed to evaluate individual predictive factors for cancer immunotherapy efficacy. In a first step, the methodology proposes a causal inference model to describe the joint distribution of the pretreatment predictors and the individual causal treatment effect. Further, in a second step, the so-called predictive causal information (PCI), a metric that quantifies the amount of information the pretreatment predictors convey on the individual causal treatment effects, is introduced and its properties are studied. The methodology is applied to identify predictors of therapeutic success for a therapeutic vaccine in advanced lung cancer.

Methods: We propose a framework, Comparative Disease Assessment (CDA), for assessing the impact of exposure to morbidity from some diseases on health outcomes, particularly death from other (relevant) diseases. This framework has been developed following the ideas of the CRA framework and using the widely accepted concept that exposure to morbidity is usually a risk factor for health outcomes (morbidity/mortality) related to other diseases. Our framework uses a counterfactual and not a categorical approach when attributing the burden of health outcomes to potential causes. Results: This paper describes the different steps and assumptions required to implement the CDA framework, and an illustrative example is used considering diabetes mellitus morbidity as a risk factor for death from heart diseases. Conclusions: One advantage of the CDA framework is that it can be applied using multi-causal death registries. Some assumptions are needed to implement it in order to avoid biases, but at least it can provide preliminary estimations of the impact of exposure to diseases as risk factors for deaths from other diseases. Another main advantage is that the burden of deaths is no longer attributed to a single cause, the underlying cause, as it is almost always done. Finally, this framework provides information on the pattern of comorbidity in a (sub)population of subjects who is about to die. These patterns can be used as a reference for alternative patterns of the general population or patterns of other specific subpopulations. © 2020, The Author(s).","We introduce an approach to characterize the dynamics of disordered quantum networks. Each quantum element (i.e., each node) of the network experiences the other nodes as an effective environment that can be self-consistently represented by a Feynman-Vernon influence functional. For networks having the topology of locally treelike graphs, these Feynman-Vernon (FV) functionals can be determined by a new version of the cavity or belief propagation (BP) method. Here, we find the fixed point solution of this version of BP for a network of uniform quantum harmonic oscillators. Then, we estimate the effects of the disorder in these networks within the replica symmetry ansatz. We show that over a large time interval, at small disorder, the real part of the FV functional induces decoherence and classicality while at sufficiently large disorder the Feynman-Vernon functional tends to zero and the coherence survives, signaling in a time setting, the onset of an Anderson's transition. © 2022 authors.

Magnolia, a flagship tree genus that has 15 endemic and threatened taxa (12 species and 3 subspecies) on the Caribbean islands, offers an excellent case study to empirically test Caribbean biogeographical hypotheses. We constructed phylogenetic hypotheses to: (1) reveal their evolutionary history, (2) test the current largely morphology-based classification and assess species limits, and (3) investigate major biogeographic hypotheses proposed for the region. Nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequence data of all 15 Caribbean Magnolia taxa are included, supplemented by a selection of American mainland species, and species representing most major clades of the Magnoliaceae family. We constructed phylogenetic hypotheses in a time-calibrated Bayesian framework, supplemented with haplotype network analyses and ancestral range estimations. Genetic synapomorphies in the studied markers confirm the species limits of 14 out of 15 morphologically recognizable Caribbean Magnolia taxa. There is evidence for four colonization events of Magnolia into the Caribbean from the American mainland, which most likely occurred by overwater dispersal, given age estimates of maximum 16 mya for their presence on the Caribbean islands. © 2021 The Authors","This work presents a method for multiview object recognition and the estimation of the sequence of object views. The main feature of the method is to be lightweighted, which can be crucial for future sensor technology. This goal is achieved with a hidden Markov model of the 3D object from information of a sequence of 2D images. COIL 100 dataset were used for testing the method. The tests included images affected by rotation as well as Gaussian noise. Consistent results were obtained using relatively few shots of each class for the training process. © 2022 IEEE.","Introduction: To obtain control of the COVID-19 epidemic in Cuba, the decision was made by the highest management of the government and the Ministry of Public Health to carry out a health intervention with Abdala vaccine in Matanzas province, due to its high incidence and mortality. Objective: To estimate the impact and effectiveness of Abdala vaccine in the face of symptomatic disease of reported cases and death in hospitals in Matanzas province. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, with a cohort of vaccinated people consisting of 252,557 people who met the three-dose schedule, and another of unvaccinated or who had not complied with the complete vaccination schedule of 325,462 people. Age and personal pathological history were explored. As a source of information, the registry of confirmed cases and deaths issued by the Ministry of Public Health and the automated vaccination base Andariego Higia were used. It was calculated the effectiveness (VE=1-RR) and by confidence intervals and analyzed epidemiological indicators with the Bayesian structural time series method. Results: The effectiveness against symptomatic disease and death was 75.5 % and 95.7 %, respectively. In the analysis of the causal impact, values of reduction of 90.0% of the reported incidence and 86.0% of mortality were evidenced with respect to the expected figures.

Some authors have considered the variability of the group in a single taxon while others have divided it into two, three, and four-taxa. The present work aimed to model the ecological niche of the Cuban taxa of Magnolia subsect. Talauma, and identify which of the three main classification systems for these taxa aligns better with the ecological niche model analysis. We used fieldwork data and herbarium specimens as occurrence data. As niche predictors, we used variables from the WorldClim database. After a preparation process (spatial thinning of occurrences, pre-model, candidate models) the ecological niche models were made in Maxent, considering different taxonomic classifications proposed. Annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality were the variables with the highest contribution to the models of all the taxa, except for M. orbiculata (Maximum temperature and elevation). The ecological niche models of Magnolia subsect. Talauma in Cuba showed the mountains of Sierra Maestra and Nipe-Sagua-Baracoa as the most suitable areas for these taxa; no matter the classification system used. Magnolia orbiculata had the smallest areas of niche suitability, and was the only taxon with a different ecological niche, supporting its status of species. The taxa of the north-eastern showed a high level of ecological similarity, making impossible to determine which classification system has the higher support, and which are the ecological limits of the taxa. © 2022 Universidad de La Habana.

We present a graph SLAM system based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) where the sensor readings are represented with different symbols using a number of clustering techniques; then, the symbols are fused as a single prediction, to improve the accuracy rate, using a Dual HMM. Our system’s versatility allows to work with different types of sensors or fusion of sensors, and to implement, either active or passive, graph SLAM. A graph-SLAM approach proposed by the International’s Karto Robotics in Cartographer, the nodes represent the pose of the robot and the edges the constraints between them. Nodes are usually defined according to contiguous nodes except when loop closures are detected where constraints for non-contiguous nodes are introduced, which corrects the whole graph. Detecting loop closure is not trivial; in the ROS implementation, scan matching is performed by Sparse Pose Adjustment (SPA). Cartographer uses an occupancy map in order to estimate the position where the map representation is done via Gmapping. The Toyota HSR (Human Support Robot) robot was used to generate the data set in both real and simulated competition environments. In our SLAM representation, we have wheel odometry estimate according to initial position of the robot, a Hokuyo 2D Lidar scan for observations, and a signal control and a world representation is estimated. We tested our system in the kidnapped robot problem by training a representation, improving it online, and, finally, solving the SLAM problem. © Korenevsky S.N., 2021.","The ancestral sequence reconstruction problem is the inference, back in time, of the properties of common sequence ancestors from the measured properties of contemporary populations. Standard algorithms for this problem assume independent (factorized) evolution of the characters of the sequences, which is generally wrong (e.g. proteins and genome sequences). In this work, we have studied this problem for sequences described by global co-evolutionary models, which reproduce the global pattern of cooperative interactions between the elements that compose it. For this, we first modeled the temporal evolution of correlated real valued characters by a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on a finite tree. This represents sequences as Gaussian vectors evolving in a quadratic potential, who describe the selection forces acting on the evolving entities. Under a Bayesian framework, we developed a reconstruction algorithm for these sequences and obtained an analytical expression to quantify the quality of our estimation. We extend this formalism to discrete valued sequences by applying our method to a Potts model. We showed that for both continuous and discrete configurations, there is a wide range of parameters where, to properly reconstruct the ancestral sequences, intra-species correlations must be taken into account. We also demonstrated that, for sequences with discrete elements, our reconstruction algorithm outperforms traditional schemes based on independent site approximations. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA Medialab srl.","The Heliconiini genera Agraulis and Dryas are widely distributed throughout the Neotropics and into adjacent temperate regions, and although they are currently treated as monotypic, both show significant geographic phenotypic variation. In this work, we employ six genetic markers (4199 bp), two mitochondrial and four nuclear, to perform coalescent species delimitation analyses in Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BPP) and in integrated BPP (iBPP), the latter also includes linear measurements and wings landmarks. We also analyze cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) barcode sequences for each genus using genetic distances, haplotype networks and a character-based approach. Based on the model testing results, complemented with data from previous studies, we performed morphometric analyses to compare fore and hindwing size, aspect ratio and shape among the new species. In addition, we compared the forewing spot pattern of hypothesizes species using the r package patternize and, for Dryas, compared the colour patterns of mature larvae. Model testing of the molecular species delimitation outputs favoured a seven species hypothesis for Agraulis and a four species hypothesis for Dryas. Average distances among COI barcode sequences of these groups were from 1.09 to 5.81% in Agraulis and from 1.09 to 3.44% in Dryas. Within-group distances ranged from 0 to 1.11% and between 0 and 2.43%, respectively. NeighborNet haplotype networks showed that all but one of the species are monophyletic, and the character-based approach found exclusive diagnostic positions for most species, while the rest can be recognized by unique combinations of the 44 informative nucleotide positions analysed. Morphometric analysis supported all species of Agraulis and Dryas based on wing shape, and also in several cases on wing sizes and aspect ratio (hindwing length–forewing length), including A. v. galapagensis, which was absent from the molecular study. The analysis of the forewing spot pattern also revealed differences among most species hypothesis. The colour pattern of the last instar larva is also diagnostic for each Dryas species hypothesis. Locality data for species in both genera show that most of them are allopatric albeit a few have contact zones being parapatric at some locations. Based on the observed genetic differences, which covary with morphology and geographical distribution, we recommend the recognition of eight species of Agraulis: A. incarnata, A. vanillae, A. forbesi new status, A. insularis reinstated status, A. maculosa new status, A. lucina reinstated status, A. galapagensis new status and one undescribed species, and four species of Dryas: D. iulia, D. dominicana revised status, D. lucia revised status and D. alcionea reinstated status. Further work is needed to investigate, which selective forces have led to the current configurations of venation and wing shape, the probable gene flow among species with a focus on Agraulis and gather more data on species ecology.

For implementing sensitivity analysis, several multiple imputation methods exist, like sequential imputation, which restricts to monotone missingness, and Bayesian, where the imputation and analysis models differ, entailing overestimation of variance. Also, full conditional specification provides a conditional interpretation of sensitivity parameters, requiring further calibration to get the desired marginal interpretation. We propose in this paper a multiple imputation procedure, based on a multivariate linear regression model, which keeps compatibility in sensitivity analysis under intermittent missingness, providing a marginal interpretation of the elicited parameters. Simulation studies show that the method behaves well with longitudinal data and remains robust under demanding constraints. We conclude the possibility of situations not covered by the existing methods and well suited for our proposal, which allows more efficient handling of a given multivariate linear regression structure. Its use is illustrated in a real case study, where a sensitivity analysis is accomplished. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Human activities are an increasing threat to Neotropical freshwater ecosystems, with the potential extinction of thousands of aquatic species. Despite this, knowledge about the effectiveness of protected area networks in protecting aquatic insects in this biogeographical region is very limited. Cuba supports the highest diversity of aquatic insects in the Antilles, with a large number of endemics. A gap analysis was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the National System of Protected Areas of Cuba (NSPAC) in the conservation of Cuban diving beetles (family Dytiscidae). This involved considering the areas with the highest potential species richness, estimated by using species distribution models with three different approaches (MaxEnt, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine), and the known localities of endemic species. The highest potential species richness of Dytiscidae in Cuba is predicted to occur in the low–medium altitude of the eastern mountain areas. Although most of these areas occur inside the NSPAC, several areas of potential high species richness are currently unprotected. It is recommended that sampling programmes are carried out in areas with high predicted species richness to validate the species distribution models. The distribution of three Cuban endemic species (Copelatus barbouri, Desmopachria glabella and Celina cubensis) lies completely outside of the NSPAC. Despite their conservation interest as threatened endemic species, they are currently unprotected. To improve the conservation of freshwater biodiversity in Cuba it is recommended that (i) the NSPAC network is extended to protect areas supporting endemic species and those with the highest potential species richness that are currently unprotected, and (ii) a whole-catchment management approach, specifically to maintain natural flows, should be adopted, especially in the mountainous areas of eastern Cuba. © 2021 The Authors.

This study presents the identification, in time and frequency domains, of linear time invariant models of the human subglottal system, for the clinical assessment of vocal function. For time domain identification, the input-output data corresponds to the glottal volume velocity and the acceleration registered by a sensor on the neck skin of the patient. For frequency domain identification, the frequency response of the subglottal tract module is used. Maximum likelihood and prediction error methods are applied. Additionally, the Akaike and Bayes Information Criteria are used to select the models order.

However, in several applications, such as biology, data result from stochastic evolutionary processes, and configurations are related through a hierarchical structure, typically represented by a tree, and therefore not independent. In turn, empirical averages of observables superpose intrinsic signals related to the equilibrium distribution of the studied system, and spurious historical (or phylogenetic) signals resulting from the structure underlying the data-generating process. The naive application of inverse statistical physics techniques therefore leads to systematic biases and an effective reduction of the sample size. To advance on the currently open task of extracting intrinsic signals from correlated data, we study a system described by a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process defined on a finite tree. Using a Bayesian framework, we can disentangle covariances in the data corresponding to their multivariate Gaussian equilibrium distribution from those resulting from the historical correlations. Our approach leads to a clear gain in accuracy in the inferred equilibrium distribution, which corresponds to an effective two to fourfold increase in sample size. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA Medialab srl.","Ecological Niche Modelling (ENM) is a tool widely used in ecology to determine environmental conditions and the potential distribution of species. In this article we assess the potential distribution, tolerance limits and similarity niche of macroalgae epiphytes and hosts from the Cuba marine shelf. Using different methods (BIOCLIM, Gower, Maxent and SVM) we have modelled the niche for each species. The final prediction map of distribution was made using the ensemble prediction technique. The similarity of ENMs was quantified by Schoener D and Hellinger I distance. The predictive power of all models was reasonable, since the values of the area under the curve (AUC) were greater than 0.9. The host macroalgae most closely related to the spatial distribution pattern of potential abundance of epiphytic macroalgae are Stypopodium zonale (Kendall correlation, r2 = 0.886) and Digenea simplex (Kendall correlation, r2 = 0.777). Environmental variables that contributed mostly (30 %) to the ecological niche models were: the average maximum salinity per year (35.5−36 PSU); the average minimum flow velocity per year (0.2 m·s−1) and the average minimum light at ground level per year (10−60 E·m−2·yr−1). The results show that epiphytic macroalgae and their most common hosts are generalist species (niche width 0.8) with high overlap in their niche (Schoener D > 0.7; Hellinger I distance = I > 0.6). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","One of the aims of Cleaner Production refers to the reduction of risks for the human population. Domino effect accidents trigger the worst consequences in process industries. To date, several techniques and models have been used for predicting domino effect probability, such as Bayesian networks and Petri Nets. In addition, these methodologies can be combined with other classical ones, for instance, Event and Fault Trees. However, there is no mentioned methodology in specialized literature which accurately combines them in order to predict the individual impact of domino effect accidents. This paper focuses on the quantification of the individual impact of domino effect scenarios using an Integrated Bayesian- Petri Net method. For this purpose, a model of seven steps is proposed based on a combination of proven methods to obtain a new one with the advantages of both graphical structures, including the ability to minimize their limitations. To prove the validity of the new model, this model and other three ones are applied in a hydrocarbon storage area as well. The application of the proposed model in this area allows to reduce the incident occurrence by 59%. That is why we can assure that the proposed study is vital for preserving resources and minimizing risk to individual's life in hydrocarbon facilities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","The instrumental role of CK2 in the SARS-CoV-2 infection has pointed out this protein kinase as promising therapeutic target in COVID-19. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity has been reported by CK2 inhibitors in vitro; however, no anti-CK2 clinical approach has been investigated in COVID-19. This trial aimed to explore the safety and putative clinical benefit of CIGB-325, an anti-CK2 peptide previously assessed in cancer patients. A monocentric, controlled, and therapeutic exploratory trial of intravenous CIGB-325 in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 was performed. Twenty patients were randomly assigned to receive CIGB-325 (2.5 mg/kg/day during 5-consecutive days) plus standard-of-care (10 patients) or standard-of-care alone (10 patients). Adverse events were classified by the WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology. Parametric and nonparametric statistical analyses were performed according to the type of variable. Considering the small sample size, differences between groups were estimated by Bayesian analysis. CIGB-325 induced transient mild and/or moderate adverse events such as pruritus, flushing, and rash in some patients. Both therapeutic regimens were similar with respect to SARS-CoV-2 clearance in nasopharynx swabs over time. However, CIGB-325 significantly reduced the median number of pulmonary lesions (9.5 to 5.5, p = 0.042) at day 7 and the proportion of patients with such an effect was also higher according to Bayesian analysis (pDif > 0; 0.951). Also, CIGB-325 significantly reduced the CPK (p = 0.007) and LDH (p = 0.028) plasma levels at day 7. Our preliminary findings suggest that this anti-CK2 clinical approach could be combined with standard-of-care in COVID-19 in larger studies. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","This paper presents an effective and wavelet-based seismogram denoising algorithm that considers the dependencies between the wavelet coefficients and their parents. For this purpose, a non-Gaussian bivariate distributions is used and corresponding nonlinear threshold function (shrinkage function) is derived using Bayesian estimation theory, in particular the maximum a posteriori estimator. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, the method is applied to seismograms that are corrupted with additive Gaussian noise over a wide range of noise variance. Experimental results are compared with different denoising schemes. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method not only outperforms the other denoising algorithms in terms of SNR but also helps retain other important information like the P-phase onsets. © 2003-2012 IEEE.","In recent years, domino effect accidents and domino effect prediction have been intensively studied by the scientific community. The reason for this is the serious impact of these phenomena on people, the environment, the economy, and society as well. In addition, the European Commission has defined this type of study as mandatory. One scenario that can lead to domino effect propagation is a pool fire, which has high values of thermal radiation. This research proposes a novel five-step approach for the determination of failure probability, especially when taking into consideration the structure mechanism of failure in the case of domino effect propagation due to pool fires. In addition, the determination of time to failure, escalation probability, as well as failure due to the received thermal radiation are combined using expert criteria (Fuzzy logic) to obtain an overall failure probability. In all cases, failure due to the decreasing of the strength material is very likely, due to the actual shape thickness of all of the process units. Highest values of failure probability correspond to process units which are in the same subarea. In order to quantify synergic effects, a Bayesian network is developed resulting in domino effect probabilities of 1.0000E−4, which means that there is a high probability of domino effect occurrence. In order to validate the new proposed approach, this approach in combination with another are applied to an actual hydrocarbon storage area as well. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","This work proposes a hybrid brain-computer interface (HBCI) using Bayesian method to fuse information from electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography signals (EMG) for decoding movement intention. For EEG signal feature extraction, Riemannian covariance matrices are computed, whereas other three features into the time and frequency domain are extracted from each EMG channel, such as autoregressive models, signal slope changes, and zero crossing. In this approach, the Bayesian fusion method is used to combine predictions from Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) classifiers. Our proposed HBCI obtained average accuracy of 96.26%, recall of 93.97, kappa of 0.78, and false positive rate of 3.31%, outperforming solution only based on EEG or EMG, suggesting its potential for neuro-rehabilitation applications. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Unmanned or Autonomous Systems act in an uncertain world. In order to plan and make decisions, autonomous systems can only rely on noisy perceptions and approximated models. The data collected from sensors is inherently uncertain due to noise, incompleteness, and inconsistency. The analysis of such massive amounts of data requires advanced analytical techniques for efficiently reviewing and/or predicting future courses of action with high precision and advanced decision-making strategies. Due to the amount, variety, and speed of data increases, so too does the uncertainty inherent within, leading to a lack of confidence in the resulting analytics process and decisions made thereof. Under these conditions, deep learning algorithms can be fully integrated into robotic systems only if a measure of prediction uncertainty is available. Prediction uncertainty in deep neural networks generally derives from two sources: data uncertainty and model uncertainty. The former arises because of noise in the data, usually caused by the sensors’ imperfections. The latter instead is generated from unbalances in the training data distribution. The article describes the developing fully autonomous vehicles at three levels, namely, perception, planning and control. Ideas from artificial intelligence have also been used to solve planning problems for autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles have to deal with dynamic, non-stationary- and highly unpredictable operational environments. For the right understanding of this process, is described the best-known control strategies, map representation techniques, interaction with external systems, including pedestrian interactions under an informational conception of Internet of Things and Big Data Uncertainty and Uncertainty in Machine Learning, The article shows an analysis of the most promissory methods for treating the deep leaning uncertainty: Bayesian Deep Learning, which is an intersection between deep learning and Bayesian probability approaches and the Fuzzy logic machine learning, in an Internet of Things framework. For the validation of theoretical explanations, it was proposed some simulations tools for visualizing and interpreting the uncertainty in the previously mentioned models and in the internet of things framework in different environments, useful for teaching and research. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","In this paper, we analize and benchmark three genetically-evolved reactive obstacle-avoidance behaviors for mobile robots. We buit these behaviors with an optimization process using genetic algorithms to find the one allowing a mobile robot to best reactively avoid obstacles while moving towards its destination. We compare three approaches, the first one is a standard method based on potential fields, the second one uses on finite state machines (FSM), and the last one relies on HMM-based probabilistic finite state machines (PFSM). We trained the behaviors in simulated environments to obtain the optimizated behaviors and compared them to show that the evolved FSM approach outperforms the other two techniques. © 2021 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","In the province of Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, the COVID-19 epidemic has a limited progression that shows an early small-number peak of infections. Most published mathematical models fit data with high numbers of confirmed cases. In contrast, small numbers of cases make it difficult to predict the course of the epidemic. We present two known models adapted to capture the noisy dynamics of COVID-19 in the Santiago de Cuba province. Parameters of both models were estimated using the approximate-Bayesian-computation framework with dedicated error laws. One parameter of each model was updated on key dates of travel restrictions. Both models approximately predicted the infection peak and the end of the COVID-19 epidemic in Santiago de Cuba. The first model predicted 57 reported cases and 16 unreported cases. Additionally, it estimated six initially exposed persons. The second model forecasted 51 confirmed cases at the end of the epidemic. In conclusion, an opportune epidemiological investigation, along with the low number of initially exposed individuals, might partly explain the favorable evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in Santiago de Cuba. With the available data, the simplest model predicted the epidemic evolution with greater precision, and the more complex model helped to explain the epidemic phenomenology. © 2021.

This might preclude the formation of appropriate face representations and, consequently, hamper effective recognition. The present ERP study, in combination with Bayesian source reconstruction, investigates how information related to both external (E) and internal (I) features was processed by E.C. and I.P., suffering from acquired and developmental prosopagnosia, respectively. They carried out a face-feature matching task with new faces. E.C. showed poor performance and remarkable lack of early face-sensitive P1, N170 and P2 responses on right (damaged) posterior cortex. Although she presented the expected mismatch effect to target faces in the E-I sequence, it was of shorter duration than in Controls, and involved left parietal, right frontocentral and dorsofrontal regions, suggestive of reduced neural circuitry to process face configurations. In turn, I.P. performed efficiently but with a remarkable bias to give “match” responses. His face-sensitive potentials P1–N170 were comparable to those from Controls, however, he showed no subsequent P2 response and a mismatch effect only in the I-E sequence, reflecting activation confined to those regions that sustain typically the initial stages of face processing. Relevantly, neither of the prosopagnosics exhibited conspicuous P3 responses to features acting as primes, indicating that diagnostic information for constructing face representations could not be sufficiently attended nor deeply encoded. Our findings suggest a different locus for altered neurocognitive mechanisms in the face network in participants with different types of prosopagnosia, but common indicators of a deficient allocation of attentional resources for further recognition. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","This paper presents a comparison between discrete Hidden Markov Models and Convolutional Neural Networks for the image classification task. By fragmenting an image into sections, it is feasible to obtain vectors that represent visual features locally, but if a spatial sequence is established in a fixed way, it is possible to represent an image as a sequence of vectors. Using clustering techniques, we obtain an alphabet from said vectors and then symbol sequences are constructed to obtain a statistical model that represents a class of images. Hidden Markov Models, combined with quantization methods, can treat noise and distortions in observations for computer vision problems such as the classification of images with lighting and perspective changes. We have tested architectures based on three, six and nine hidden states favoring the detection speed and low memory usage. Also, two types of ensemble models were tested. We evaluated the precision of the proposed methods using a public domain data set, obtaining competitive results with respect to fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks, but using significantly less computing resources. This is of interest in the development of mobile robots with computers with limited battery life, but requiring the ability to detect and add new objects to their classification systems. © 2020 St. Petersburg Institute for Informatics and Automation of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Here, we illustrate the use of a causal inference model to identify predictive biomarkers of CIMAvaxEGF success in the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients. Methods: Data from a controlled clinical trial evaluating the effect of CIMAvax-EGF were analyzed retrospectively, following a causal inference approach. Pre-treatment potential predictive biomarkers included basal serum EGF concentration, peripheral blood parameters and immunosenescence biomarkers. The proportion of CD8 + CD28- T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD4/CD8 ratio and CD19+ B cells. The 33 patients with complete information were included. The predictive causal information (PCI) was calculated for all possible models. The model with a minimum number of predictors, but with high prediction accuracy (PCI > 0.7) was selected. Good, rare and poor responder patients were identified using the predictive probability of treatment success. Results: The mean of PCI increased from 0.486, when only one predictor is considered, to 0.98 using the multivariate approach with all predictors. The model considering the proportion of CD4+ T cell, basal Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) concentration, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, Monocytes, and Neutrophils as predictors were selected (PCI > 0.74). Patients predicted as good responders according to the pre-treatment biomarkers values treated with CIMAvax-EGF had a significant higher observed survival compared with the control group (p = 0.03). No difference was observed for bad responders. Conclusions: Peripheral blood parameters and immunosenescence biomarkers together with basal EGF concentration in serum resulted in good predictors of the CIMAvax-EGF success in advanced NSCLC. Future research should explore molecular and genetic profile as biomarkers for CIMAvax-EGF and it combination with immune-checkpoint inhibitors. The study illustrates the application of a new methodology, based on causal inference, to evaluate multivariate pre-treatment predictors. The multivariate approach allows realistic predictions of the clinical benefit of patients and should be introduced in daily clinical practice. © 2020 The Author(s).","Oceanic islands constitute natural laboratories to study plant speciation and biogeographic patterns of island endemics. Juan Fernandez is a southern Pacific archipelago consisting of three small oceanic islands located 600–700 km west of the Chilean coastline. Exposed to current cold seasonal oceanic climate, these 5.8–1 Ma old islands harbor a remarkable endemic flora. All known Fernandezian endemic grass species belong to two genera, Megalachne and Podophorus, of uncertain taxonomic adscription. Classical and modern classifications have placed them either in Bromeae (Bromus), Duthieinae, Aveneae/Poeae, or Loliinae (fine-leaved Festuca); however, none of them have clarified their evolutionary relationships with respect to their closest Festuca relatives. Megalachne includes four species, which are endemic to Masatierra (Robinson Crusoe island) (M. berteroniana and M. robinsoniana) and to Masafuera (Alejandro Selkirk island) (M. masafuerana and M. dantonii). The monotypic Podophorus bromoides is a rare endemic species to Masatierra which is only known from its type locality and is currently considered extinct. We have used museomic approaches to uncover the challenging evolutionary history of these endemic grasses and to infer the divergence and dispersal patterns from their ancestors. Genome skimming data were produced from herbarium samples of M. berteroniana and M. masafuerana, and the 164 years old type specimen of P. bromoides, as well as for a collection of 33 species representing the main broad- and fine-leaved Loliinae lineages. Paired-end reads were successfully mapped to plastomes and nuclear ribosomal cistrons of reference Festuca species and used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees. Filtered ITS and trnTLF sequences from these genomes were further combined with our large Loliinae data sets for accurate biogeographic reconstruction. Nuclear and plastome data recovered a strongly supported fine-leaved Fernandezian clade where Podophorus was resolved as sister to Megalachne. Bayesian divergence dating and dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis range evolution analyses estimated the split of the Fernandezian clade from its ancestral southern American Pampas-Ventanian Loliinae lineage in the Miocene-Pliocene transition, following a long distance dispersal from the continent to the uplifted volcanic palaeo-island of Santa Clara-Masatierra. Consecutive Pliocene-Pleistocene splits and a Masatierra-to-Masafuera dispersal paved the way for in situ speciation of Podophorus and Megalachne taxa. © Copyright © 2020 Moreno-Aguilar, Arnelas, Sánchez-Rodríguez, Viruel and Catalán.","Purpose: To present the impact in coverage of different methods for Poisson confidence intervals and the impact in dose coverage of different uncertainty factors. A detailed explanation of the uncertainty sources in the Bayesian method is also presented. Materials and methods: The exact coverage of uncertainty Poisson confidence intervals and the dose uncertainty interval coverage were performed by simulations using R-based scripts. Results: The Poisson exact calibration interval via the Modified Crow and Gardner method resulted in coverage quite close to the nominal level of confidence; additionally, the method retains the shortest property of Crow and Gardner, and gains the property of a lower limit strictly increasing in the mean of dicentrics. The unlimited simultaneous calibration interval seems to be the method of choice to preserve the coverage at 95% under parametric and nonparametric conditions but is a conservative method. When samples came from a Poisson distribution, the ISO propagation of errors and Bayesian approaches seem to be the closest to the 95% coverage. Conclusions: The Modified Crow and Gardner method should be preferred over the Garwood method for Poisson exact confidence intervals. The unlimited simultaneous calibration interval did not lose its property to preserve the coverage at 95% applying a regression coverage factor of value 2.02 at the point of doses studied in the simulation. © 2020, Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.","The paper presents a risk-based model to coordinate the generators preventive maintenance of an isolated distributed Power System with wind generation presence. The model coordinates preventive maintenance minimizing the risk of loss of load probability in the Power System. The risk is estimated with a sequential Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation model. In this paper, the preventive maintenance scheduling (PMS) of the generating units is a non-linear stochastic optimization problem and it is efficiently solved with the algorithms Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). The model allows Power System operators to obtain a maintenance schedule that minimizes the risk of loss of load probability, as much as possible in the Power System; as well as establishing the desired level of risk. The model is applied in a Cuban Power System isolated from the main national power grid constituting a distributed system, and has the presence of a wind farm in its energetic matrix. The paper demonstrates the proposed model effectiveness in this real Power System. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","We present a Bayesian approach for the Contamination Source Detection problem in water distribution networks. Assuming that contamination is a rare event (in space and time), we try to locate the most probable source of such events after reading contamination patterns in few sensed nodes. The method relies on strong simplifications considering binary clean/contaminated states for nodes in discrete time, and therefore focuses on the time structure of the sensed patterns rather than on the concentration levels. As a result, a posterior probability over discrete variables is written, and posterior marginals are computed using belief propagation algorithm. The resulting algorithm runs once on a given observation and reports probabilities for each node being the source and for the contamination patterns altogether. We test it on Anytown model, proving its efficacy even when only a single sensed node is known. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","The circumscription of Rondeletieae has changed considerably over time. Historically, 85 genera have been included, characterized by small trees, imbricate corolla aestivation and capsules. Molecular studies led to a narrower circumscription and stressed out that Rondeletieae is mainly an Antillean clade. As historically circumscribed, Rondeletieae is both polyphyletic (involving several tribes, including Condamineae, Sipaneeae, etc.) and paraphyletic with respect to Guettardeae. Uncertainties persist on the tribal circumscription, and its generic limits and relationships. We report results of phylogenetic analyses under parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses including 179 taxa, using concatenated datasets of three chloroplast DNA regions (petD, trnL–F and trnK–matK), their DNA microstructural characters as well as morphology. Our objectives are to: test the monophyly of Rondeletieae and evaluate phylogenetic relationships, evaluate potential characters for tribal and generic delimitation and propose a circumscription for Rondeletieae according to phylogenetic hypothesis using morphological characters. The tribes Guettardeae and Rondeletieae are strongly supported as sister: quincuncial aestivation and spathulate corolla lobes are proposed as a unique combination of characters supporting this relationship. We did not find synapomorphies for each tribe, but there is a set of character combinations that allows distinguishing both tribes that includes the corolla and pollen ornamentation as well as fruit and seed morphology. After evaluating other genera not included in the phylogenies, our proposal is that Rondeletieae contains approximately 120 species in 20 neotropical genera: Acrosynanthus, Acunaeanthus, Blepharidium, Donnellyanthus, Mazaea, Phyllomelia, Rachicallis, Roigella, Rondeletia, Rovaeanthus, Suberanthus, Tainus, plus one tentatively included and recently described (Jamaicanthus). © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Premise of research.

With the goal of illuminating the evolutionary origins of Caribbean Phyllanthus, we undertook a phylogenetic analysis significantly increasing previous samplings of the genus in the Neotropics. We reconstructed the evolution of selected morphological characters and evaluated the implications of our results in light of the representation of Caribbean and Neotropical species in the infrageneric classification of the genus. Methodology. We estimated phylogentic trees using parsimony, Bayesian, and likelihood approaches based on plastid and nuclear sequence data sets. These represented 78 taxa from the Neotropics, most of which were generated for this study, as well as most other subgenera and sections of Phyllanthus and other genera of Phyllanthaceae. Four vegetative and four floral morphological characters were assessed for the whole study group. Ancestral character states were reconstructed using BayesTraits. Pivotal results. Plastid and nuclear partitions agree on a highly supported Caribbean clade that contains the vast majority of the species from this region as being part of a large Neotropical clade. Another small Caribbean clade is found nested among African linages. Although morphological characters exhibit some level of homoplasy, some trends are evident, for example, in the large Neotropical clade. Conclusions. The majority of species in the Caribbean belong to a single clade that has evolved from Neotropical ancestors. This is well circumscribed with morphology and corresponds to subgenus Xylophylla, the concept of which is adjusted here to be monophyletic. The existence of a small Caribbean clade related to African species marks a noteworthy case of Caribbean plant origin. Although phyllanthoid branching is not a synapomorphy for Phyllanthus s.l. (including Breynia, Glochidion, and Sauropus), combinations of vegetative and floral characters allow a clear assignment to the Phyllanthus s.l. clade. © 2020 by The University of Chicago.

Here, the relation between mean tract-based fractional anisotropy (mTBFA) and intelligence indices was explored. Deterministic tractography was performed using a regions of interest approach for 10 white-matter fascicles along which the mTBFA was calculated. The study sample included 83 healthy individuals from the second wave of the Cuban Human Brain Mapping Project, whose WAIS-III intelligence quotients and indices were obtained. Inspired by the “Watershed model” of intelligence, we employed a regularized hierarchical Multiple Indicator, Multiple Causes model (MIMIC), to assess the association of mTBFA with intelligence scores, as mediated by latent variables summarizing the indices. Regularized MIMIC, used due to the limited sample size, selected relevant mTBFA by means of an elastic net penalty and achieved good fits to the data. Two latent variables were necessary to describe the indices: Fluid intelligence (Perceptual Organization and Processing Speed indices) and Crystallized Intelligence (Verbal Comprehension and Working Memory indices). Regularized MIMIC revealed effects of the forceps minor tract on crystallized intelligence and of the superior longitudinal fasciculus on fluid intelligence. The model also detected the significant effect of age on both latent variables. © 2019 The Authors.

In our model, each brain region is assumed to have a binary behavior (active or not), the strengths of interactions among them are encoded in the anatomical connectivity matrix defined by the HC, and the dynamics of the system is defined by the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, working near the critical point of the network. We show that in the absence of direct external stimuli the BP algorithm converges to a spatial map of activations that is similar to the Default Mode Network (DMN) of the brain, which has been defined from the analysis of functional MRI data. Moreover, we use Susceptibility Propagation (SP) to compute the matrix of long-range correlations between the different regions and show that the modules defined by a clustering of this matrix resemble several Resting State Networks (RSN) determined experimentally. Both results suggest that the functional DMN and RSNs can be seen as simple consequences of the anatomical structure of the brain and a neural message-passing dynamics between macroscopic regions. With the new model, we explore predictions on how functional maps change when the anatomical brain network suffers structural alterations, like in Alzheimer's disease and in lesions of the Corpus Callosum. The implications and novel interpretations suggested by the model, as well as the role of criticality, are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Corynespora cassiicola (Burk. & M.A. Curtis) C.T. Wei. is an anamorphic fungus that affects more than 530 plant species, including economically important crops. Several lineages of this pathogen have been recognized, but the classification of isolates into clades is time-consuming and still sometimes leads to unclear results. In this work, eight major phylogenetic clades (PhL1–PhL8) including 245 isolates of C. cassiicola from 44 plant species were established based on a Bayesian inference analysis of four combined C. cassiicola genomic loci retrieved from GenBank, i.e., rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS), actin-1,ga4, and caa5. The existence of PhL1–PhL5 and PhL7 as clonal lineages was further confirmed through the analysis of full-genome single-nucleotide polymorphisms of 39 isolates. Haplotypes of the caa5 locus were PhL specific and encode isoforms of the LDB19 domain of a putative α-arrestin N-terminal–like protein. Evolution of the Caa5 arrestin is in correspondence with the PhLs. ga4 and caa5 PhL consensus sequences and a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) procedure were generated based on the conserved nucleotide sequences and enzyme restriction patterns observed among isolates from the same lineage, respectively. The CAPS method was validated in silico, and its practical use allowed us to differentiate between tomato and papaya isolates, as well as to reveal the prevalence of PhL1 among isolates infecting soybean in Brazil. This novel approach could be useful in the efforts to control the diseases associated with C. cassiicola. © 2019, © 2019 The Mycological Society of America.","The rum aging process shows volume losses, called wastage. The numerical operation variables: product, boardwalk, horizontal and vertical positions, date, volume, alcoholic degree, temperature, humidity and aging time, recorded in databases, contain valuable information to study the process. MATLAB 2017 software was used to estimate volume losses. In the modeling of the rum aging process, the multilayer perceptron neuronal network with one and two hidden layers was used, varying the number of neurons in these between 4 and 10. The Levenberg-Marquadt (LM) and Bayesian training algorithms were compared (Bay) The increase in 6 consecutive iterations of the validation error and 1,000 as the maximum number of training cycles were the criteria used to stop the training. The input variables to the network were: numerical month, volume, temperature, humidity, initial alcoholic degree and aging time, while the output variable was wastage. 546 pairs of input/output data were processed. The statistical Friedman and Wilcoxon tests were performed to select the best neural architecture according to the mean square error (MSE) criteria. The selected topology has a 6-4-4-1 structure, with an MSE of 2.1∙10-3 and a correlation factor (R) with experimental data of 0.9898. The neural network obtained was used to simulate thirteen initial aging conditions that were not used for training and validation, detecting a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9961. © 2020, Revista Facultad de Ingenieria.

This class of stochastic optimization algorithm with learning from the structure and parameters of local populations are based on independence test and decentralized populations scheme, which can reduce the number of function evaluations solving for discrete optimization problems.

The three parameter logistic (3P logistic) and the Richards models have been used to estimate primary epidemiological parameters in single dengue outbreak. A topic that could be of interest to epidemiologists is the comparison of two single dengue outbreaks based on estimates of key epidemiological parameters: The turning point, the final size and the basic reproductive number R0. In order to compare two single dengue outbreaks we create a model that takes into account both outbreaks simultaneously. In this paper, we describe different methodologies based on Frequentist and Bayesian approaches that takes into account the model uncertainty in the comparison of two single dengue outbreaks. The Frequentist approach consists of comparing outbreak doing an extension of 3P logistic and Richards models and the use of model averaging for taking into account model uncertainty. In the Bayesian approach, we use a Bayesian hierarchical model and we use Bayesian model averaging applying Gibbs variable selection. The proposed methods are applied to dengue outbreaks that occurred in La Lisa municipality, Havana City, Cuba during 2006 and 2007 outbreaks. © 2020 Universidad de La Habana.

Theory predicts symbionts like Wolbachia will be more common in species radiations, as host shift events occur with greatest frequency between closely related species. Further, the presence of Wolbachia itself may engender reproductive isolation, and promote speciation of their hosts. Here we screened 178 individuals belonging to 30 species of the damselfly genera Nesobasis and Melanesobasis — species radiations endemic to the Fiji archipelago in the South Pacific — for Wolbachia, using multilocus sequence typing to characterize bacterial strains. Incidence of Wolbachia was 71% in Nesobasis and 40% in Melanesobasis, and prevalence was also high, with an average of 88% in the Nesobasis species screened. We identified a total of 25 Wolbachia strains, belonging to supergroups A, B and F, with some epidemic strains present in multiple species. The occurrence of Wolbachia in both males and females, and the similar global prevalence found in both sexes rules out any strong effect of Wolbachia on the primary sex-ratio, but are compatible with the phenotype of cytoplasmic incompatibility. Nesobasis has higher species richness than most endemic island damselfly genera, and we discuss the potential for endosymbiont-mediated speciation within this group. © 2019, The Author(s).","Cognition and behavior emerge from brain network interactions, such that investigating causal interactions should be central to the study of brain function. Approaches that characterize statistical associations among neural time series—functional connectivity (FC) methods—are likely a good starting point for estimating brain network interactions. Yet only a subset of FC methods (‘effective connectivity’) is explicitly designed to infer causal interactions from statistical associations. Here we incorporate best practices from diverse areas of FC research to illustrate how FC methods can be refined to improve inferences about neural mechanisms, with properties of causal neural interactions as a common ontology to facilitate cumulative progress across FC approaches. We further demonstrate how the most common FC measures (correlation and coherence) reduce the set of likely causal models, facilitating causal inferences despite major limitations. Alternative FC measures are suggested to immediately start improving causal inferences beyond these common FC measures. © 2019, Springer Nature America, Inc.","Purpose: The goal was to compare the micronucleus (MN) and dicentric plus ring chromosomes (D + R) assays for dose assessment in cases of partial body irradiations (PBI). Materials and methods: We constructed calibration curves for each assay at doses ranging from 0 to 5 Gy of X-rays at dose rate of 0.275 Gy/min. To simulate partial-body exposures, blood samples from two donors were irradiated with 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 Gy and the ratios of irradiated to unirradiated blood were 25, 50, and 100%. Different tests were used to confirm if all samples were overdispersed or zero-inflated and for partial-body dose assessment we used the Qdr, Dolphin and Bayesian model. Results: In our samples for D + R calibration curve, practically all doses agreed with Poisson assumption, but MN exhibited overdispersed and zero-inflated cellular distributions. The exact Poisson tests and zero-inflated tests demonstrate that virtually all samples of D + R from PBI simulation fit the Poisson distribution and were not zero-inflated, but the MN samples were also overdispersed and zero-inflated. In the partial-body estimation, when Qdr and Dolphin methods were used the D + R results were better than MN, but the doses estimation defined by the Bayesian methodology were more accurate than the classical methods. Conclusions: Dicentric chromosomes continue to prove to be the best biological marker for dose assessment. However exposure scenarios of partial-body estimation, overdispersion and zero-inflation may not occur, it being a critical point not only for dose assessment, but also to confirm partial-body exposure. MN could be used as alternative assay for partial-body dose estimation, but in case of an accident without any information, the MN assay could not define whether the accident was a whole-body irradiation (WBI) or a PBI. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.","In this brief communication, which complements the EEG reference review (Yao et al. in Brain Topogr, 2019), we provide the mathematical derivations that show: (1) any EEG reference admits the general form of a linear transformation of the ideal multichannel EEG potentials with reference to infinity; (2) the average reference (AR), the reference electrode standardization technique (REST), and its regularized version (rREST) are solving the linear inverse problems that can be derived from both the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and the Bayesian theory; however, REST is based on more informative prior/constraint of volume conduction than that of AR; (3) we show for the first time that REST is also a unipolar reference (UR), allowing us to define a general family of URs with unified notations; (4) some notable properties of URs are ‘no memory’, ‘rank deficient by 1’, and ‘orthogonal projector centering’; (5) we also point out here, for the first time, that rREST provides the optimal interpolating function that can be used when the reference channel is missing or the ‘bad’ channels are rejected. The derivations and properties imply that: (a) any two URs can transform to each other and referencing with URs multiple times will not accumulate artifacts; (b) whatever URs the EEG data was previously transformed with, the minimum norm solution to the reference problem will be REST and AR with and without modeling volume conduction, respectively; (c) the MLE and the Bayesian theory show the theoretical optimality of REST. The advantages and limitations of AR and REST are discussed to guide readers for their proper use. © 2019, The Author(s).","Event related potentials (ERPs) provide precise temporal information about cognitive processing, but with poor spatial resolution, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reliably identifies brain areas involved, but with poor temporal resolution. Here we use fMRI to guide source localization of the ERPs at different times for studying the temporal dynamics of the neural system for recognizing familiar faces. fMRI activation areas were defined in a previous experiment applying the same paradigm used for ERPs. The Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method was used to estimate the generators of the ERPs to unfamiliar, visually familiar, and personally-familiar faces constraining the model by fMRI activation results. For this, higher prior probabilities in the solution space were assigned to the fMRI-defined regions, which included face-selective areas and other areas related to “person knowledge” retrieval. Source analysis was carried out in three-time windows: early (150–210 ms), middle (300–380 ms) and late (460–580 ms). The early and middle responses were generated in fMRI-defined areas for all face categories, while these areas do not contribute to the late response. Different areas contributed to the generation of the early and middle ERPs elicited by unfamiliar faces: fusiform (Fus), inferior occipital, superior temporal sulcus and the posterior cingulate (PC) cortices. For familiar faces, the contributing areas were Fus, PC and anterior temporal areas for visually familiar faces, with the addition of the medial orbitofrontal areas and other frontal structures for personally-significant faces. For both unfamiliar and familiar faces, more extended and reliable involvement of contributing areas were obtained for the middle compare with early time window. Our fMRI guide ERP source analysis suggested the recruitment of person-knowledge processing areas as early as 150–210 ms after stimulus onset during recognition of personally-familiar faces. We concluded that fMRI-constrained BMA source analysis provide information regarding the temporal-dynamics in the neural system for cognitive processsing. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","In this article, approximate linear minimum variance (LMV) filters for continuous-discrete state space models are introduced. The filters are derived from a wide class of recursive approximations to the predictions for the first two conditional moments of the state equation between each pair of consecutive observations. The convergence of the approximate filters to the exact LMV filter is proved when the error between the predictions and their approximations decreases no matter the time distance between observations. As particular instance, the order-$\\beta$ local linearization filters are presented and expounded in detail. Practical adaptive algorithms are also provided and their performance in simulation is illustrated with various examples. The proposed filters are intended for the recurrent practical situation where a stochastic dynamical system should be identified from a reduced number of partial and noisy observations distant in time. © 2017 The authors.

Given a scene view, we first propose a 3D feature extraction from a point cloud as a series of observations for a Hidden Markov Model; then, we evaluate the Profile HMM in the place recognition task using a publicly available dataset. Furthermore, we evaluated a classical HMM in the object recognition task in the context of anthropomorphic service robots. Results show that our approach performs well in the aforementioned tasks with high recognition rates. © 2019 IEEE.","Data coming from meteorological radars is of the utmost importance for the diagnosis and monitoring of precipitation systems and their possible associated severe phenomena. The echoes caused by objectives that are not meteorological introduce errors in the information. Therefore, it is necessary to detect their presence before using this data. This paper presents four supervised classification techniques based on different models which seek to give an answer to this problem. In addition, as an important part of this work, resampling techniques were implemented on the training set in order to further asses the results. Resampling methods are an indispensable tool in modern statistics. Those techniques provide additional information about the model of interest by repeatedly drawing samples from then data. Based on data from a C-band Dual-PolarizationDoppler weather radar located in Anguil and from a previous expert's manual classification, four supervised classification methods with different degrees of flexibility in their structure were implemented: Lineal Model, Quadratic Model, Logistic Model and Bayes Naive Model. Finally, the results of each of them were assessed and compared. Although difficulties were encountered in classifying boundary zones between classes, the results obtained were adequate, showing the best performance in the least flexible model, the linear one. It is considered necessary to keep working in this line of research in order to include more cases in the analysis and allow a better inference on the results. © 2019 Centro Argentino de Meteorologos.","The genus Calisto is endemic to the West Indies and the only representative there of the Satyrinae. Here we reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of the herophile group and describe five new species from Cuba: Calisto gundlachi sp. nov., Calisto siguanensis sp. nov., Calisto disjunctus sp. nov., Calisto sharkeyae sp. nov. and Calisto lastrai sp. nov. We employ one mitochondrial and four nuclear markers to assess the phylogenetic position, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference approaches, of the new taxa. Our phylogenetic trees yielded two strongly supported main clades with four of the new species included within them and C. sharkeyae as sister group to the rest of the major main clade. We conduct time-divergence estimations and ancestral area reconstructions using BEAST and BioGeoBEARS. The group originated 12.15 million years ago during the middle Miocene in north-eastern Cuba, Nipe-Sagua-Baracoa Massif. After 6 million years of in situ evolution most lineages started to colonise other Cuban territories and the Bahamas. This scenario is consistent with key geological events, including the closure of the western Havana-Matanzas channel 8-6 million years ago, the uplift of the Sierra Maestra 6-5 million years ago, and the land connections among Cuban regions during the Miocene-Pleistocene sea level drops. Dispersal and vicariance processes may have occurred, with populations surviving floodings on the major and minor mountain ranges, which remained as 'islands'. © 2019 CSIRO.","Hydrophilic composites of poly (acrylamide-co-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) reinforced with hydroxyapatite were synthesized, characterized and evaluated as drug delivery systems. The results show a strong dependence of the polymer composition, the degree of crosslinking and the homogeneity of the particles dispersion (filler or the mixed drug) in the characteristics that were analyzed. The mechanical properties were better while the swelling and the diffusion coefficient were worse than hydrogels with cefazolin of similar compositions. A new information criterion based on Bayesian criteria was used to elucidate the best fit. The drug diffusion into the medium was anomalous with more tendency to diffusional transport, indicating that under certain conditions zero-order diffusion could be achieved. This fact suggests that these materials could be used in the manufacture of medical devices for the controlled delivery of drugs and active or biological principles, significantly improving therapeutic procedures today. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","A Bayesian model for sparse, hierarchical, inver-covariance estimation is presented, and applied to multi-subject functional connectivity estimation in the human brain. It enables simultaneous inference of the strength of connectivity between brain regions at both subject and population level, and is applicable to fMRI, MEG and EEG data. Two versions of the model can encourage sparse connectivity, either using continuous priors to suppress irrelevant connections, or using an explicit description of the network structure to estimate the connection probability between each pair of regions. A large evaluation of this model, and thirteen methods that represent the state of the art of inverse covariance modelling, is conducted using both simulated and resting-state functional imaging datasets. Our novel Bayesian approach has similar performance to the best extant alternative, Ng et al.'s Sparse Group Gaussian Graphical Model algorithm, which also is based on a hierarchical structure. Using data from the Human Connectome Project, we show that these hierarchical models are able to reduce the measurement error in MEG beta-band functional networks by 10%, producing concomitant increases in estimates of the genetic influence on functional connectivity. © 2018","Phoebis Hübner (1819) is a genus of the Neotropical subfamily Coliadinae (Lepidoptera: Pieridae). The highest diversity is found in the Greater Antilles islands in the Caribbean region. Although from the taxonomic point of view, Phoebis seems to be a stable genus, there is no phylogenetic hypothesis corroborating the monophyly of the genus. In this study, we used both morphological characters and a genetic dataset consisting of one mitochondrial (COI) and three nuclear markers (RpS5, MDH, Wingless). The matrix was concatenated and analysed with parsimony under implied weights (IW). Also, the concatenated data set was analysed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference evolutionary methods, and ancestral states reconstruction with characters traditionally used for classification of Phoebis was carried out. The same topology was recovered by Parsimony, ML and BI analysis, and suggest that Phoebis is not a monophyletic genus, with Aphrissa and Rhabdodryas nested within it. Our findings allow us to consider the genera Rhabdodryas syn.rev. and Aphrissa syn.rev. to be synonyms of Phoebis. These results have implications for the systematics of Phoebis and the genera that should be accepted in Coliadinae.

In the last decade, efforts have been made to develop a mathematical framework in order to image the effective sources of hemoglobin variations in brain tissues. Different approaches can be used to impose additional information or constraints when reconstructing the cerebral images of an ill-posed problem. The goal of this study is to compare the performance and limitations of several source localization techniques in the context of fNIRS tomography using individual anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to model light propagation. The forward problem is solved using a Monte Carlo simulation of light propagation in the tissues. The inverse problem has been linearized using the Rytov approximation. Then, Tikhonov regularization applied to least squares, truncated singular value decomposition, back-projection, L1-norm regularization, minimum norm estimates, low resolution electromagnetic tomography and Bayesian model averaging techniques are compared using a receiver operating characteristic analysis, blurring and localization error measures. Using realistic simulations (n = 450) and data acquired from a human participant, this study depicts how these source localization techniques behave in a human head fNIRS tomography. When compared to other methods, Bayesian model averaging is proposed as a promising method in DOT and shows great potential to improve specificity, accuracy, as well as to reduce blurring and localization error even in presence of noise and deep sources. Classical reconstruction methods, such as regularized least squares, offer better sensitivity but higher blurring; while more novel L1-based method provides sparse solutions with small blurring and high specificity but lower sensitivity. The application of these methods is also demonstrated experimentally using visual fNIRS experiment with adult participant. © 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.","Medicine faces the challenge of acquiring, analyzing and applying knowledge to solve complex clinical problems. The accelerated development of technology has allowed the storage and processing of large volumes of information composed of different types of data, which are not always as accurate and complete as necessary.

Currently, both the average reference (AR) and the reference electrode standardization technique (REST) are two primary, apparently irreconcilable contenders. We propose a theoretical framework to resolve this reference issue by formulating both (a) estimation of potentials at infinity, and (b) determination of the reference, as a unified Bayesian linear inverse problem, which can be solved by maximum a posterior estimation. We find that AR and REST are very particular cases of this unified framework: AR results from biophysically non-informative prior; while REST utilizes the prior based on the EEG generative model. To allow for simultaneous denoising and reference estimation, we develop the regularized versions of AR and REST, named rAR and rREST, respectively. Both depend on a regularization parameter that is the noise to signal variance ratio. Traditional and new estimators are evaluated with this framework, by both simulations and analysis of real resting EEGs. Toward this end, we leverage the MRI and EEG data from 89 subjects which participated in the Cuban Human Brain Mapping Project. Generated artificial EEGs-with a known ground truth, show that relative error in estimating the EEG potentials at infinity is lowest for rREST. It also reveals that realistic volume conductor models improve the performances of REST and rREST. Importantly, for practical applications, it is shown that an average lead field gives the results comparable to the individual lead field. Finally, it is shown that the selection of the regularization parameter with Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) is close to the \"oracle\" choice based on the ground truth. When evaluated with the real 89 resting state EEGs, rREST consistently yields the lowest GCV. This study provides a novel perspective to the EEG reference problem by means of a unified inverse solution framework. It may allow additional principled theoretical formulations and numerical evaluation of performance. © 2018 Hu, Yao and Valdes-Sosa.","This paper describes a map representation and localization system for a mobile robot based on Hidden Markov Models. These models are used not only to find a region where a mobile robot is, but also they find the orientation that it has.

We experimentally induced stimulus familiarity via a systematic learning procedure including faces with and without associated verbal information. Then, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in both intra-domain (face-feature) and cross-domain (face-occupation) matching tasks while N400-like responses were elicited by incorrect eyes-eyebrows completions and occupations, respectively. A novel Bayesian source reconstruction approach plus conjunction analysis of group effects revealed that in both cases the generated N170s were of similar amplitude but had different neural origin. Thus, whereas the N170 of faces was associated predominantly to right fusiform and occipital regions (the so-called “Fusiform Face Area”, “FFA” and “Occipital Face Area”, “OFA”, respectively), the N170 of occupations was associated to a bilateral very posterior activity, suggestive of basic perceptual processes. Importantly, the right-sided perceptual P200 and the face-related N250 were evoked exclusively in the intra-domain task, with sources in OFA and extensively in the fusiform region, respectively. Regarding later latencies, the intra-domain N400 seemed to be generated in right posterior brain regions encompassing mainly OFA and, to some extent, the FFA, likely reflecting neural operations triggered by structural incongruities. In turn, the cross-domain N400 was related to more anterior left-sided fusiform and temporal inferior sources, paralleling those described previously for the classic verbal N400. These results support the existence of differentiated neural streams for face structure and person-related verbal processing triggered by faces, which can be activated differentially according to specific task demands. © 2018 Olivares, Lage-Castellanos, Bobes and Iglesias.","Aim: The processes that shaped the West Indian fern flora remain poorly understood. We attempt to investigate earlier biogeographical patterns described for the region using the genus Adiantum as model. These patterns propose that the West Indian fern flora has (1) an essentially continental rather than insular character, having a rich representation of species occurring in tropical America; (2) the Greater Antilles have a higher fern diversity and higher endemism than the Lesser Antilles, and (3) adaptive speciation has been an important process in shaping the fern diversity of the Greater Antilles. Location: West Indies. Methods: Adiantum is a subcosmopolitan genus that comprises 200–225 species of which 33 occur in the West Indies. We compiled the most comprehensive molecular dataset of Adiantum available to date, including the chloroplast markers rbcL, atpA, atpB and trnL-F of 407 accessions belonging to 101 species, 24 of which occur in the West Indies. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference approaches were applied to generate phylogenetic hypotheses. Divergence times were estimated using published substitution rates. Ancestral areas were estimated using BioGeoBEARS. Results: The extant West Indian Adiantum species originate from at least 17 predominantly Miocene immigration events, 11 from South America and six from Central America, in combination with two cladogenetic events. The Cuban endemics Adiantum alomae and A. sericeum, as well as the Greater Antillean A. deltoideum, A. cristatum and A. pyramidale first appeared during the Pleistocene. The emergence of A. alomae and A. deltoideum coincides with the formation of the karstic relief of the Cuban coasts. Main conclusions: Immigration, rather than cladogenesis, governed the evolution of the West Indian Adiantum species. Our results concur with theoretical models proposed for island communities, suggesting that geologically younger and smaller island assemblages mainly derive from immigration, whereas cladogenesis plays an important role in older and larger islands. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","The new genus Roselymyces is established based on morphological and molecular analyses.

In the mathematical formulation, the accurate determination of the model parameters is an important step for the design of chromatographic conditions for continuous separation in SMB processes. This work is aimed at the estimation of the model parameters in adsorption processes, using a chromatographic column for the separation of glucose and fructose. The Bayesian framework for inverse problems is investigated through the implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) and a critical comparison against the classical Maximum Likelihood approach, with the minimization of the objective function via two different stochastic techniques, namely the Particle Collision Algorithm (PCA), and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is performed. Different cases are presented in order to investigate the statistical significance of the estimates obtained, and perform comparisons between the solution via Bayesian inference and via the minimization of the objective function with the stochastic methods.

The aim of this paper is to check whether the excellent properties reported for this algorithm in machine learning papers, have some impact on the efficiency and efficacy of EDA based optimization. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperform well-known state of the art EDA like BOA and EBNA in a test bed based on B-functions. On the basis of these results we conclude that the proposed scheme is a promising candidate for challenging real-world applications, specifically, problems related to the areas of Data Mining, Patter Recognition and Artificial Intelligence. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","This paper presents a new approach for fault diagnosis of industrial processes during transitions. The proposed diagnosis strategy is based on the combination of the nearest-neighbor classification rule and the multivariate Dynamic Time Warping time series similarity measure. The proposal is compared with four different classification methods: Bayes Classifier, Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network, Support Vector Machines and Long Short-Term Memory Network which have high performance in the specialized scientific bibliography. The continuous stirred tank heater benchmark is used under scenarios of faults occurring at different moments of a transition and scarce fault data. The proposed approach achieves a classification performance approximately 20% superior compared to the best results of the four instance-based classifiers. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","In this paper, the use of supervised classifiers for leak location in water distribution networks (WDN) is discussed. A comparative study is presented in the context of a benchmark network under the same leak and sensor placement scenarios. The comparison considers four classification tools widely used in the pattern recognition framework: Nearest Neighbor, Bayes Classifier, Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. The classifiers’ selection is made by considering their different working principles and application advantages. Training and testing sets are formed by the residuals generated by using the EPANET hydraulic simulator. The robustness of the methods is compared with respect to the leak location performance under model parameter uncertainty, demand uncertainty, leak size uncertainty and sensor noise. The SVM performs similar or better than the other classifiers when all uncertainties are present. © 2018","Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) is a framework for making inferences about changes in brain connectivity using neuroimaging data. We fitted DCMs to high-density EEG data from subjects performing a semantic picture matching task. The subjects are carriers of the PSEN1 mutation, which leads to early onset Alzheimer's disease, but at the time of EEG acquisition in 1999, these subjects were cognitively unimpaired. We asked 1) what is the optimal model architecture for explaining the event-related potentials in this population, 2) which connections are different between this Presymptomatic Carrier (PreC) group and a Non-Carrier (NonC) group performing the same task, and 3) which network connections are predictive of subsequent Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) trajectories. We found 1) a model with hierarchical rather than lateral connections between hemispheres to be optimal, 2) that a pathway from right inferotemporal cortex (IT) to left medial temporal lobe (MTL) was preferentially activated by incongruent items for subjects in the PreC group but not the NonC group, and 3) that increased effective connectivity among left MTL, right IT, and right MTL was predictive of subsequent MMSE scores. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

The goal of this study was to explore the existence of short- and long-term survival populations and to assess the effect of immunotherapy on them. Methods: Data from two randomized, multicenter, controlled clinical trials was used to evaluate the effect of two therapeutic vaccines (anti-idiotypic vaccine VAXIRA and anti-EGF vaccine CIMAVAX) on survival curves in advanced non–small cell lung cancer patients. Data were fitted to Kaplan-Meier, standard Weibull survival, and two-component Weibull mixture models. Bayesian Information Criterion was used for model selection. Results: VAXIRA did not modify, neither the fraction of patients with long-term survivals (0.18 in the control group v 0.19 with VAXIRA, P =.88), nor the median overall survival of the patients in the short-term survival subpopulation (6.8 v 7.8 months, P =.24). However, this vaccine showed great benefit for the patients belonging to the subpopulation of patients with long-term survival (33.8 v 76.6 months, P <.0001). CIMAVAX showed impact in the overall survival of both short- and long-term populations (6.8 v 8.8 months, P =.005 and 33.8 v 61.8 months, P =.007). It also increased the proportion of patients with long-term survival (from 0.18 to 0.28, P =.02). Conclusions: This study shows that therapeutic vaccines produce differential effects on short- and long-term survival populations and illustrates the application of advanced statistical methods to deal with the long-term evolution of patients with advanced lung cancer in the era of immunotherapy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Rough Cognitive Networks (RCNs) are a kind of granular neural network that augments the reasoning rule present in Fuzzy Cognitive Maps with crisp information granules coming from Rough Set Theory. While RCNs have shown promise in solving different classification problems, this model is still very sensitive to the similarity threshold upon which the rough information granules are built. In this paper, we cast the RCN model within the framework of fuzzy rough sets in an attempt to eliminate the need for a user-specified similarity threshold while retaining the model's discriminatory power. As far as we know, this is the first study that brings fuzzy sets into the domain of rough cognitive mapping. Numerical results in the presence of 140 well-known pattern classification problems reveal that our approach, referred to as Fuzzy-Rough Cognitive Networks, is capable of outperforming most traditional classifiers used for benchmarking purposes. Furthermore, we explore the impact of using different heterogeneous distance functions and fuzzy operators over the performance of our granular neural network. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","The estimation of EEG generating sources constitutes an Inverse Problem (IP) in Neuroscience. This is an ill-posed problem due to the non-uniqueness of the solution and regularization or prior information is needed to undertake Electrophysiology Source Imaging. Structured Sparsity priors can be attained through combinations of (L1 norm-based) and (L2 norm-based) constraints such as the Elastic Net (ENET) and Elitist Lasso (ELASSO) models. The former model is used to find solutions with a small number of smooth nonzero patches, while the latter imposes different degrees of sparsity simultaneously along different dimensions of the spatio-temporal matrix solutions. Both models have been addressed within the penalized regression approach, where the regularization parameters are selected heuristically, leading usually to non-optimal and computationally expensive solutions. The existing Bayesian formulation of ENET allows hyperparameter learning, but using the computationally intensive Monte Carlo/Expectation Maximization methods, which makes impractical its application to the EEG IP. While the ELASSO have not been considered before into the Bayesian context. In this work, we attempt to solve the EEG IP using a Bayesian framework for ENET and ELASSO models. We propose a Structured Sparse Bayesian Learning algorithm based on combining the Empirical Bayes and the iterative coordinate descent procedures to estimate both the parameters and hyperparameters. Using realistic simulations and avoiding the inverse crime we illustrate that our methods are able to recover complicated source setups more accurately and with a more robust estimation of the hyperparameters and behavior under different sparsity scenarios than classical LORETA, ENET and LASSO Fusion solutions. We also solve the EEG IP using data from a visual attention experiment, finding more interpretable neurophysiological patterns with our methods.

The Center of Molecular Immunology created an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (CIMABior®), biosimilar of rituximab, which has been characterized from a biological point of view, but the safety and effectiveness are still being studied. Objective: Evaluate the safety and response to treatment, in patients with B-cell malignancies with compassionate use of CIMABior®. Methods: A multicenter, exploratory, non-controlled, non-randomized study was conducted with two variants of treatments (monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy). Adults with non-Hodgkin lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia not eligible for clinical trial with this product were included. Frequency of adverse events was calculated and those were characterized. The response to treatment was defined as: complete response, partial response, stable disease or progressive disease. Overall response rate (complete plus partial remission) was calculated with 95% confidence interval. The relation of some variables with response was estimated per Odss ratio. As a measure of the benefit-risk balance, the Bayes factor was estimated. Results: The more frequent adverse events were: tremors (12.8%) and fever (10.3%). Those related to the product (43.4%) were minor and evolved to recovery. There were no deaths in reference to the treatment. An overall response of 71.2% was confirmed (59.6% complete remissions and 11.5% partial remission). The monotherapy group objective response was 66.7% and 73.0% in the CIMABior® plus chemotherapy group, with complete remissions of 46.7% and 64.9% respectively. Conclusions: The monoclonal antibodies CIMABor® is safe, well tolerated and evidences of its effectiveness was demonstrated. The treatment provided a superior clinical benefit to the risk of developing a severe adverse event. © 2017 Revista Cubana de Hematología, Inmunología y Hemoterapia.","We consider inference under a nonparametric or semiparametric model with likelihood that factorizes as the product of two or more variation-independent factors.We are interested in a finitedimensional parameter that depends on only one of the likelihood factors and whose estimation requires the auxiliary estimation of one or several nuisance functions. We investigate general structures conducive to the construction of so-called multiply robust estimating functions, whose computation requires postulating several dimension-reducing models but which have mean zero at the true parameter value provided one of these models is correct. © 2017 Biometrika Trust.","Pisione is a scaleless group of small scale worms inhabiting sandy bottoms in shallow marine waters. This group was once considered rare, but now 45 described species can be characterized, among others, by their paired, segmental copulatory organs (one to multiple external pairs), which display a complexity of various accessory structures. The evolutionary significance of these unique organs was suggested in the late 1960s, but has been heavily debated since the late 1990s and remains controversial. In the present paper, we study the internal relationships within Pisione, employing combined phylogenetic analyses of both molecular and morphological data from 16 terminals of Pisione, as well as two terminals of Pisionidens, and eight additional scale worms as outgroups. Our taxon sampling covers all geographical areas where the genus has been reported, as well as most of their morphological and copulatory variability, including representatives of the “africana,” “remota,” “crassa,” and “papuensis” groups, established previously by Yamanishi. We hereby provide a first insight into the relationships of the genus, testing previously proposed hypotheses on the evolutionary significance of male copulatory structures within Pisione, while attempting to understand patterns of distribution. The phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods consistently recovered two large clades spanning the East Atlantic (including the Mediterranean) and the Indo-Pacific–West Atlantic, respectively. Character optimization on our trees revealed a high degree of homoplasy in both non-reproductive and sexual characters of Pisione, with buccal acicula found to be the sole apomorphy among the morphological features assessed herein, with none defining the biogeographical subclades within. Overall, our comparative analyses highlight the high degree of morphological variation in this widely distributed genus, rejecting previous assertions of an increasing number and complexity of copulatory structures across the genus. © 2017 The Authors.

The kind of message passing algorithm used for CVM, usually named generalized belief propagation (GBP), is a generalization of the belief propagation algorithm in the same way that CVM is a generalization of the Bethe approximation for estimating the partition function. However, the connection between fixed points of GBP and the extremal points of the CVM free energy is usually not a one-to-one correspondence because of the existence of a gauge transformation involving the GBP messages. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose a way of defining messages (fields) in a generic CVM approximation, such that messages arrive on a given region from all its ancestors, and not only from its direct parents, as in the standard parent-to-child GBP. We call this approach maximal messages. Second, we focus on the case of binary variables, reinterpreting the messages as fields enforcing the consistency between the moments of the local (marginal) probability distributions. We provide a precise rule to enforce all consistencies, avoiding any redundancy, that would otherwise lead to a gauge transformation on the messages. This moment matching method is gauge free, i.e., it guarantees that the resulting GBP is not gauge invariant. We apply our maximal messages and moment matching GBP to obtain an analytical expression for the critical temperature of the Ising model in general dimensions at the level of plaquette CVM. The values obtained outperform Bethe estimates, and are comparable with loop corrected belief propagation equations. The method allows for a straightforward generalization to disordered systems. © 2017 American Physical Society.","INTRODUCTION: Cuba's HIV epidemic is characterized by high genetic diversity, with circulation of several subtypes and recombinant forms. Earlier studies described a predominance of subtype B in the HIV-positive population, but these studies did not take into account patients' epidemiologic history. OBJECTIVE: Clarify the origin and phylodynamics of HIV-1 subtype B in the Cuban epidemic. METHODS: We analysed phylogenetic relationships among 120 sequences (from different geographic origins) of the pol gene in HIV-1 subtype B isolates from Cuban patients diagnosed from 1987 through 2012. Time of HIV-1 subtype B introduction and viral evolutionary rate were determined using a Bayesian coalescent method. RESULTS: Based on phylogenetic relationships, subtype B was introduced into Cuba multiple times. Subtype B spread in Cuba through dissemination of strains that probably came from the USA, Canada and Europe. The time of the most recent common ancestor of Cuban subtype B was close to 1977 (95% CI 1974-1982), and the evolutionary rate was 2.7 × 10-3 nucleotide substitutions per site per year. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest multiple introductions of HIV-1B into Cuba in the late 1970s, predominantly strains from North America and Europe. The results reflect the importance of maintaining, reviewing and updating molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in Cuba, due to its rapid evolution and possible implications for the National STI/HIV/AIDS Program of Cuba's Ministry of Public Health.","The infrageneric classification of Asplenium, the most species-rich genus of ferns, is notoriously difficult as a result of extensive morphological homoplasy combined with exceptional morphological disparity. Besides a core Asplenium, 29 satellite genera have been described, but most of them have not been widely accepted. In recent years, molecular phylogenetic studies found most of these satellite genera to be nested in Asplenium, but several morphologically distinct taxa have not yet been included in such studies. One of these elements is the monospecific neotropical genus Schaffneria which is characterized by undivided suborbicular blades, lack of a costa, black stipes, netted veins and single or paired sori. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic inference based on the chloroplast DNA markers rbcL, rps4, rps4-trnS and trnL-trnF indicated a position of Schaffneria nigripes within Asplenium. We thus propose to treat Schaffneria as a synonym of Asplenium and adopt the name Asplenium nigripes. With the current sampling, Asplenium (Schaffneria) nigripes is placed sister to A. pumilum, the only species of Asplenium with whitish catenate hairs on its leaves. Despite considerable morphological differences, both species resemble each other in several features including filiform-lanceolate, mostly entire, brown-blackish rhizome scales with a dark-sclerotic center and some marginal projections, a striate, hairy epidermis, echinolophate spore ornamentation with slim microechinate folds forming small lacunae, and Aspidium-type gametophytes. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.","In 2010, new Chinese strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), clinically more severe than the classical strains, emerged. These strains were spread to United States in 2013 through an intercontinental transmission from China with further spreading across the world, evidencing the emergent nature of these strains. In the present study, an analysis of PEDV field sequences from Ecuador was conducted by comparing all the PEDV S gene sequences available in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic comparisons and Bayesian phylogeographic inference based on complete S gene sequences were also conducted to track the origin and putative route of PEDV. The sequence from the PED-outbreak in Ecuador was grouped into the clade II of PEDV genogroup 2a together with other sequences of isolates from Mexico, Canada, and United States. The phylogeographic study revealed the emergence of the Chinese PEDV strains, followed by spreading to US in 2013, from US to Korea, and later the introduction of PEDV to Canada, Mexico, and Ecuador directly from the US. The sources of imports of live swine in Ecuador in 2014 were mainly from Chile and US. Thus, this movement of pigs is suggested as the main way for introducing PEDV to Ecuador. © 2017 Maritza Barrera et al.","The taxonomic status of the Hispaniolan species of Calisto Hübner, 1823 included in the chrysaoros group is reassessed. Morphological data and COI barcode sequences were analysed through different methods: Neighbour-Joining clustering, ABGD, Median-Joining Haplotype Network, Maximum Likelihood, and Bayesian Inference. Analyses yielded two deeply separated groups or putative species: C. clydoniata and C. chrysaoros. A shallower split was found, except in the Bayesian Inference approach, among populations of southern and northern Hispaniola palaeo-islands. In light of these findings we propose the recognition of two species: C. clydoniata and C. chrysaoros. Within the latter, the populations of the southern and northern Hispaniola palaeo-islands should be recognised as different subspecies: C. chrysaoros chrysaoros Bates and C. chrysaoros galii Schwartz, respectively. Calisto clenchi, syn. nov. is a synonym of C. chrysaoros chrysaoros whereas C. galii galli, syn. nov. and C. galii choneupsilon, syn. nov. are synonyms of C. chrysaoros galii. © CSIRO 2017.","The predominantly Greater Antillean endemic genus Calisto Hübner, 1823 is highly diversified on several islands being more species rich on Hispaniola. We conducted expeditions during five years in the Dominican Republic resulting in new findings related with lyceius species group. Material belonging to this group was examined following the traditional morphological characters employed in genus taxonomy, and the COI barcode sequences obtained were analyzed through different approaches: Neighbor Joining clustering, ABGD, Maximum Likelihood (ML), and Bayesian Inference (BI). Analysis yielded 12 groups representing putative species: eight corresponding to previously named ones and four new species which are described in the present work: C. mariposa sp. nov., C. azua sp. nov., C. victori sp. nov., and C. Samana sp. nov. The results also confirmed a single taxonomic entity within C. pulchella Lathy and the conspecific nature of C. franciscoi Gali and C. hendersoni. A dichotomic key for identification of species within the group is also given. Both phylogenetic reconstruction methods (ML and BI) employing molecular data achieved similar results with the relationships among the majority of taxa being supported by some ecological and morphological features. The exceptions were C. zangis Fabricius, C. raburni Gali, and C. pulchella, grouped together in a weakly supported clade. These species possess a highly differentiated adult and immature morphology which indicates an earlier divergence.

This lineage of flowering plants constitutes an important component of the flora of the Caribbean islands with many endemics. Furthermore, because it is also diverse in adjacent Mexico, Mesoamerica and South America, it allows a representative analysis of possible migration routes into the Caribbean. Location: Neotropics, Cuba, Hispaniola and the Caribbean region, Mexico and Mesoamerica. Methods: We generated a well-resolved and dated phylogenetic hypothesis based on a dense sampling, in particular of the New World taxa but also representing all remaining Acalyphoideae, and combined datasets of chloroplast spacers and introns. Bayesian divergence-time estimation was applied to determine node ages. Ancestral states of distributional areas were reconstructed in a Bayesian framework to determine the geographical origin of the Caribbean ancestors. Results: A Neotropical clade started to diversify 59.29 [50.41–68.44 95% highest posterior density (HPD)] Ma within the Acalyphoideae. The Caribbean islands then were reached several times independently from the Miocene onwards. The exclusively Caribbean Leucocroton–Lasiocroton–Garciadelia [9.1 (6.3–12.3 95% HPD) Ma] and Acidoton–Platygyna [9.3 (5.2–15.4 95% HPD) Ma] clades exhibit one of the most successful plant radiations in the region, and Caribbean subclades of Acalypha and Bernardia just date back to the Pliocene and Pleistocene, respectively. Main conclusions: Our data show that Mexico and Mesoamerica have played a key role as a source for today's Caribbean Acalyphoideae. Their ancestors arrived from the mainland to the Caribbean islands during the Miocene when Caribbean land masses were completely separated and then diversified in situ. We postulate long-distance dispersal to have played a major role for colonizing the Caribbean. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","During the dengue virus type 3 (DENV-3) epidemic that occurred in Havana in 2001 to 2002, severe disease was associated with the infection sequence DENV-1 followed by DENV-3 (DENV-1/DENV-3), while the sequence DENV-2/DENV-3 was associated with mild/asymptomatic infections. To determine the role of the virus in the increasing severity demonstrated during the epidemic, serum samples collected at different time points were studied. A total of 22 full-length sequences were obtained using a deep-sequencing approach. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of consensus sequences revealed that two DENV-3 lineages were circulating in Havana at that time, both grouped within genotype III. The predominant lineage is closely related to Peruvian and Ecuadorian strains, while the minor lineage is related to Venezuelan strains. According to consensus sequences, relatively few nonsynonymous mutations were observed; only one was fixed during the epidemic at position 4380 in the NS2B gene. Intrahost genetic analysis indicated that a significant minor population was selected and became predominant toward the end of the epidemic. In conclusion, greater variability was detected during the epidemic's progression in terms of significant minority variants, particularly in the nonstructural genes. An increasing trend of genetic diversity toward the end of the epidemic was observed only for synonymous variant allele rates, with higher variability in secondary cases. Remarkably, significant intrahost genetic variation was demonstrated within the same patient during the course of secondary infection with DENV-1/DENV-3, including changes in the structural proteins premembrane (PrM) and envelope (E). Therefore, the dynamic of evolving viral populations in the context of heterotypic antibodies could be related to the increasing clinical severity observed during the epidemic. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

However, one species, L. dentata, has a wide but disjointed distribution over 300 km in the west of the island. In order to estimate the relative role of vicariance and dispersal in the unexpected L. dentata distribution, we obtained partial sequences of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b (cytb) gene and control region (CR), and then applied Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), based on the identification of five genetic and geographic congruent groups of populations. The process that best explains the distribution of genetic diversity in this species is sequential range expansion from east Matanzas to the western Pinar del Río provinces, followed by isolation of groups of populations. We found relative high haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity in all but the Havana group, which has high values for both diversity parameters, suggesting that this group has been demographically stable over time. For two groups of populations (Cayuco and Bolondrón), the mismatch distribution analyses suggests past demographic expansion. In the case of the Cayuco region, the star like relationships of haplotypes in the network suggests a recent founding event, congruent with other evidence indicating that this is the most recently colonized region. Over all, the results suggest that a combination of habitat availability, temporal interconnections, and possibly the biological properties of this species, may have enabled its dispersal and range expansion compared to other species of the genus, which are more geographically restricted. © 2016 Hernández et al.

In this chapter, parameter uncertainty produced by the model and measurement errors in a front velocity chromatography model is quantified by means of a Bayesian method, the delayed rejection adaptive metropolis algorithm, which is a variant of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.

In this chapter, we approach the implementation of Bayesian-regularized artificial neural networks (BRANNs) combined with genetic algorithm (GA) feature selection, so-called Bayesian-regularized genetic neural networks (BRGNNs), in quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) analysis. BRGNN was applied to the computer-aided design of drug candidates for a variety of diseases, that is, cancer, AIDS, fungal infections, cardiac disease, etc. The neural networks were successfully trained to calculate the biological activities of a wide spectrum of drug candidates using different levels of representation of the chemical information. 2D and 3D structural descriptors were more frequently used, but quantum chemical descriptors also yielded good neural network models. In general, GA feature selection improves previous approaches by being more accurate and robust. In addition, we describe how feature selection over large pools of molecular descriptors provided valuable structural insights into ligand-target interactions. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The scarce information on distribution patterns of rare species makes it difficult to establish reliable conservation plans. We used ecological niche modelling to obtain good predictions of occurrence of two case species, the rare and endemic Gundlach's and Cuban Black-hawks in Cuba, based on presence-only data. We used records from an intensive survey undertaken in natural and modified environments. Data were integrated with environmental variables using Maxent to predict species distributions. Subsequently, we overlaid the resulting predicted distributions, the land use map and the protected areas layers to establish potential suitable habitat for these endemics and to determine if a better design of protected areas than the existing one can be proposed using both hawks' distribution in the design. Gundlach's Hawk distribution was fragmented, depending on forest distribution. Cuban Black-Hawk distribution was narrow, near the coastline. Forests and mangrove represent 57% and 45% of Gundlach's Hawk and Cuban Black-Hawk model predictions, respectively. 71% of the total forest area was represented in the distribution of Gundlach's Hawk. Mangrove area overlaps 45% of the Cuban Black-Hawk distribution. Six protected areas preserved 50% and 92% of their distributions, respectively. With few presence-only data of rare species, Maxent models were statistically and ecologically significant and reliable to develop distribution maps with high predictive power. Our results highlight the importance of natural habitats for conservation efforts of these endemic species. A good conservation program should include the protection of suitable nesting areas and expand the protected areas network containing suitable habitats for both species in forest and coastal areas. We propose the use of predictive modelling tools to strengthen conservation actions not only for rare raptors but for the 238 endemic and threatened birds of the Neotropics with scarce data, small population sizes, restricted distributions and often specialist habits. © 2015 The Authors.","Classifier ensembles appeared to be powerful alternative for handling a difficult problem. It is rapidly growing and enjoying many attentions from pattern recognition and machine learning communities. In the present report, the potential of multi-criteria decision making via multiclassifier approaches is assessed by applying them in the modeling of chemicals against hyper-pigmentation. TOMOCOMD-CARDD atom-based quadratic indices are used as descriptors to parameterize the molecular structures. Support vector machine, artificial neural network, Bayesian network, binary logistic regression, instance-based learning and tree classification applied on two collected datasets are explored as standalone classifiers. Prediction sets (PSs) are used to assess the performance of multiclassifier systems (MCSs). A strategy exploiting the principal component analysis together with pairwise diversity measures is designed to select the most diverse base classifiers to combine. Various trainable and nontrainable systems are developed that aggregate, at the abstract and continuous levels, the outputs of base classifiers. The obtained results are rather encouraging since the MCSs generally enhance the performance of the base classifiers; e.g. the best MCS obtains global accuracy of 95.51%, 88.89% in the PS for the data I and II in regard to 94.12% and 85.93% of best individual classifier, respectively. Our results suggest that the MCSs could be the best choice till the moment to obtain suitable QSAR models for the prediction of depigmenting agents. Finally, we consider these approaches will aid improving the virtual screening procedures and increasing the practicality of data mining of chemical datasets for the discovery of novel lead compounds. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.","Current high-throughput data acquisition technologies probe dynamical systems with different imaging modalities, generating massive data sets at different spatial and temporal resolutions-posing challenging problems in multimodal data fusion. A case in point is the attempt to parse out the brain structures and networks that underpin human cognitive processes by analysis of different neuroimaging modalities (functional MRI, EEG, NIRS, etc.). We emphasize that the multimodal, multiscale nature of neuroimaging data is well reflected by a multiway (tensor) structure where the underlying processes can be summarized by a relatively small number of components or 'atoms.' We introduce Markov-Penrose diagrams-an integration of Bayesian DAG and tensor network notation in order to analyze these models. These diagrams not only clarify matrix and tensor EEG and fMRI time/frequency analysis and inverse problems, but also help understand multimodal fusion via multiway partial least squares and coupled matrix-tensor factorization. We show here, for the first time, that Granger causal analysis of brain networks is a tensor regression problem, thus allowing the atomic decomposition of brain networks. Analysis of EEG and fMRI recordings shows the potential of the methods and suggests their use in other scientific domains. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Abstract Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) is the primordial member of a family of proteins responsible primarily for sensing changes in neuronal Ca2+ concentration. NCS-1 is a multispecific protein interacting with a number of binding partners in both calcium-dependent and independent manners, and acting in a variety of cellular processes in which it has been linked to a number of disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. Despite extensive studies on the Ca2+-activated state of NCS proteins, little is known about the conformational dynamics of the Mg2+-bound and apo states, both of which are populated, at least transiently, at resting Ca2+ conditions. Here, we used optical tweezers to study the folding behavior of individual NCS-1 molecules in the presence of Mg2+ and in the absence of divalent ions. Under tension, the Mg2+-bound state of NCS-1 unfolds and refolds in a three-state process by populating one intermediate state consisting of a folded C-domain and an unfolded N-domain. The interconversion at equilibrium between the different molecular states populated by NCS-1 was monitored in real time through constant-force measurements and the energy landscapes underlying the observed transitions were reconstructed through hidden Markov model analysis. Unlike what has been observed with the Ca2+-bound state, the presence of Mg2+ allows both the N- and C-domain to fold through all-or-none transitions with similar refolding rates. In the absence of divalent ions, NCS-1 unfolds and refolds reversibly in a two-state reaction involving only the C-domain, whereas the N-domain has no detectable transitions. Overall, the results allowed us to trace the progression of NCS-1 folding along its energy landscapes and provided a solid platform for understanding the conformational dynamics of similar EF-hand proteins. © 2015 Biophysical Society.","Background: Infectious bursal disease (IBD) is a highly contagious and acute viral disease, which has caused high mortality rates in birds and considerable economic losses in different parts of the world for more than two decades and it still represents a considerable threat to poultry. The current study was designed to rigorously measure the reliability of a phylogenetic marker included into segment B. This marker can facilitate molecular epidemiology studies, incorporating this segment of the viral genome, to better explain the links between emergence, spreading and maintenance of the very virulent IBD virus (vvIBDV) strains worldwide. Methodology/Principal Findings: Sequences of the segment B gene from IBDV strains isolated from diverse geographic locations were obtained from the GenBank Database; Cuban sequences were obtained in the current work. A phylogenetic marker named B-marker was assessed by different phylogenetic principles such as saturation of substitution, phylogenetic noise and high consistency. This last parameter is based on the ability of B-marker to reconstruct the same topology as the complete segment B of the viral genome. From the results obtained from B-marker, demographic history for both main lineages of IBDV regarding segment B was performed by Bayesian skyline plot analysis. Phylogenetic analysis for both segments of IBDV genome was also performed, revealing the presence of a natural reassortant strain with segment A from vvIBDV strains and segment B from non-vvIBDV strains within Cuban IBDV population. Conclusions/Significance: This study contributes to a better understanding of the emergence of vvIBDV strains, describing molecular epidemiology of IBDV using the state-of-the-art methodology concerning phylogenetic reconstruction. This study also revealed the presence of a novel natural reassorted strain as possible manifest of change in the genetic structure and stability of the vvIBDV strains. Therefore, it highlights the need to obtain information about both genome segments of IBDV for molecular epidemiology studies. © 2015 Alfonso-Morales et al.","The combination of recently developed methods for electroencephalographic (EEG) space-time-frequency analysis can provide noninvasive functional neuroimages necessary for obtaining an accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone. The aim of this study was to determine if time-frequency (TF) analysis, followed by EEG source localization, would improve the detection and identification of epileptogenic and related activity. Seventeen patients with refractory frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) were studied using video EEG recording. TF analysis identified the first epileptogenic EEG changes. Using the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach, we compared brain electromagnetic tomographic (BET) images, constructed from the TF domain, with BET images constructed from the time domain only. We determined if the localization identified by BET images was concordant with the localization from medical history and video EEG recording. TF analysis provided a clear display of subtle EEG features, including EEG lateralization, and more concordant and delimited epileptogenic zones, compared with time-domain source analysis. In conclusion, EEG TF analysis improves source localization. After a thorough validation, this methodology could become a useful noninvasive tool for localizing the epileptogenic zone in clinical practice. © EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ECNS) 2014.","In this paper, a new approach to the problem of detecting the end of the T wave (Te) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks is proposed and evaluated. The approach consists of a neural network acting as a regression function that estimates the Te location using the samples between two consecutive R peaks. The input vectors were taken using three dimensional reduction methods (Discrete Cosine Transform, DCT, Principal Component Analysis, PCA and resampling, RES) over a window of 100 samples. For training, Bayesian regularization has been used. A total of 1536 neural networks were trained. The results show that PCA and DCT are more feasible than RES as dimension reduction methods. Finally, a brief comparison with other algorithms proposed in the literature is included. © 2015 CCAL.","The formal verification of properties of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) is highly desirable for gaining confidence in the correctness of the model and the corresponding system. A significant step towards HMM verification was the development by Zhang et al. of a family of logics for verifying HMMs, called POCTL*, and its model checking algorithm. As far as we know, the verification tool we present here is the first one based on Zhang et al.’s approach. As an example of its effective application, we verify properties of a handover task in the context of human-robot interaction. Our tool was implemented in Haskell, and the experimental evaluation was performed using the humanoid robot Bert2. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Captive breeding is a widespread conservation strategy, yet such programs rarely include empirical genetic data for assessing management assumptions and meeting conservation goals. Cuban Amazon parrots (Amazona leucocephala) are considered vulnerable, and multiple on-island captive populations have been established from wild-caught and confiscated individuals of unknown ancestry. Here, we used mitochondrial haplotypic and nuclear genotypic data at 9 microsatellite loci to quantify the extent and distribution of genetic variation within and among captive populations in Zapata Swamp and Managua, Cuba, and to estimate kinship among breeders (n = 88). Using Bayesian clustering analysis, we detected 2 distinct clusters within the Zapata population, one of which was shared with Managua. Individuals from the cluster unique to Zapata possessed mitochondrial haplotypes with affinities to Cuban subspecies (A. l. leucocephala, A. l. palmarum); the shared cluster was similar, but also included haplotypes closely related to the subspecies restricted to Cayman Brac (A. l. hesterna). Overall mean kinship was low within each captive population (-0.026 to -0.012), with 19 and 11 recommended breeding pairs in Zapata and Managua, respectively, ranked according to mean kinship and informed by molecular sexing. Our results highlight the importance of understanding population history within ex situ management programs, while providing genetic information to directly inform Cuban parrot conservation. © 2015 The American Genetic Association 2015.

In this study, we model distribution and map species richness of the 40 amphibian species from eastern Cuba with the objectives of identify hotspots, detect gaps in species representation in protected areas, and select additional areas to fill these gaps. We used two modeling methods, Maxent and Habitat Suitability Models, to reach a consensus distribution map for each species, then calculate species richness by combining specific models and finally performed gap analyses for species and hotspots. Our results showed that the models were robust enough to predict species distributions and that most of the amphibian hotspots were represented in reserves, but 50 percent of the species were incompletely covered and Eleutherodactylus rivularis was totally uncovered by the protected areas. We identified 1441 additional km2 (9.9% of the study area) that could be added to the current protected areas, allowing the representation of every species and all hotspots. Our results are relevant for the conservation planning in other Caribbean islands, since studies like this could contribute to fill the gaps in the existing protected areas and to design a future network. Both cases would benefit from modeling amphibian species distribution using available data, even if they are incomplete, rather than relying only in the protection of known or suspected hotspots. © 2014 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.","A new Bayesian methodology for the analysis of external corrosion data of non-piggable underground pipelines has been developed. It allows for the estimation of the statistical distributions of the density and size of external corrosion defects from corrosion data samples taken at excavation sites along the inspected pipeline and can incorporate the detection and measurement errors associated with field inspections. Corrosion data obtained from field inspections of an upstream pipeline and from an in-line inspection of a transportation pipeline are used to illustrate and validate the proposed methodology. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Building modeling is a crucial part to implement optimal control strategies in Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems. In this research, an alternative for modeling the thermal dynamics of a critical room from a case study hotel using TRNSYS is presented. The fan coil unit installed in the room is modeled using manufacturer datasheet and implemented in TRNSYS as a mechanical ventilation. In this simulation environment, the indoor dry bulb temperature of the room is modeled as a function of the supply chilled water temperature, ambient temperature and intensity of solar radiation. A linear discrete-time state space model is proposed for describing the system dynamics using subspace identification method and a comparison with other black-box parametric models is also presented. The model is simulated using real data collected every 5 minutes by the Building Automation System (BAS) installed in the hotel. Room modeling is an important tool for predicting the thermal behavior of rooms as well as implementing an optimal control application using the model as a comfort reference. © 2014 IEEE.","Background: Recently, with the access of low toxicity biological and targeted therapies, evidence of the existence of a long-term survival subpopulation of cancer patients is appearing. We have studied an unselected population with advanced lung cancer to look for evidence of multimodality in survival distribution, and estimate the proportion of long-term survivors. Methods: We used survival data of 4944 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stages IIIb-IV at diagnostic, registered in the National Cancer Registry of Cuba (NCRC) between January 1998 and December 2006. We fitted one-component survival model and two-component mixture models to identify short- and long- term survivors. Bayesian information criterion was used for model selection. Results: For all of the selected parametric distributions the two components model presented the best fit. The population with short-term survival (almost 4 months median survival) represented 64% of patients. The population of long-term survival included 35% of patients, and showed a median survival around 12 months. None of the patients of short-term survival was still alive at month 24, while 10% of the patients of long-term survival died afterwards. Conclusions: There is a subgroup showing long-term evolution among patients with advanced lung cancer. As survival rates continue to improve with the new generation of therapies, prognostic models considering short- and long-term survival subpopulations should be considered in clinical research. © 2014 Sanchez et al.","In this work, we propose a different \"surgical modified model\" for the construction of counterfactual variables under non-parametric structural equation models. This approach allows the simultaneous representation of counterfactual responses and observed treatment assignment, at least when the intervention is done in one node. Using the new proposal, the d-separation criterion is used to verify conditions related with ignorability or conditional ignorability, and a new proof of the back door theorem is provided under this framework.","Historical records describe a disease in North America that clinically resembled dengue haemorrhagic fever during the latter part of the slave-trading period. However, the dengue epidemic that occurred in Cuba in 1981 was the first laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed outbreak of dengue haemorrhagic fever in the Americas. At that time, the presumed source of the dengue type 2 strain isolated during this epidemic was considered controversial, partly because of the limited sequence data and partly because the origin of the virus appeared to be southern Asia. Here, we present a molecular characterisation at the whole-genome level of the original strains isolated at different time points during the epidemic. Phylogenetic trees constructed using Bayesian methods indicated that 1981 Cuban strains group within the Asian 2 genotype. In addition, the study revealed that viral evolution occurred during the epidemic – a fact that could be related to the increasing severity from month to month. Moreover, the Cuban strains exhibited particular amino acid substitutions that differentiate them from the New Guinea C prototype strain as well as from dengue type 2 strains isolated globally. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.","The genus Rivulus is currently comprised of two species, R. cylindraceus and R. insulaepinorum, which are endemic to Cuba. However, the taxonomic status of the latter species remains dubious because of the poor quality of the original description. In addition, a recent barcoding survey suggests that the two species may be conspecific. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the two species represent a single evolutionary clade. To delimit the species and their evolutionary history, we used a combination of molecular phylogenetic analyses, with both mitochondrial and nuclear sequences, tests of phylogeographic hypotheses, combined with morphological measurements and information on known dispersal barriers and species distribution. None of the data sets support R. insulaepinorum and R. cylindraceus as separate taxa. However, a new species, restricted to the northwestern part of the main island, was identified by phylogenetic analyses, body colour pattern and geographical distribution. The evolutionary distance between the two lineages (. cytb, d=. 15%; CAM-4, d=. 2.5%) indicates a long period of divergence. Phylogeographic analyses shed light on the dispersal history of R. cylindraceus, which probably originated on the Isla de la Juventud. They also suggest that each lineage had contrasting histories; Rivulus sp. is restricted to a relatively small geographic area whereas R. cylindraceus has dispersed considerably and more than once from its centre of origin, probably facilitated by sea level fluctuations. These results strengthen previous findings, i.e. that the diversity of Cuban freshwater fishes is far from well-known and deserves more in-depth studies, and that vicariance and dispersal events have resulted in a complex biogeographical landscape which has had a significant impact on the freshwater fishes of the Caribbean islands. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Subfamily Gochnatioideae is the sister group of ~96% of the species in Compositae (Asteraceae). It is of particular interest not only because of its position in the phylogeny, but also because, in recent molecular studies, the node it occupies is not strongly supported making difficult any inferences on the direction of character evolution in the family. The recognition of tribe Gochnatieae was one of the results of a comprehensive molecular analysis of the family that showed the traditional circumscription of the Mutisieae to be non-monophyletic. The four genera of Gochnatieae (Cnicothamnus, Cyclolepis, Gochnatia, Richterago) were defined by the presence of apiculate anther appendages and dorsally smooth style branches. Gochnatia, which contained about 70 species, was the largest and most complex genus and in the last decade some of its sections have been moved (or returned) to the rank of genus. This study includes a large selection of potential outgroups and over 60% of all species in the tribe, including all the genera and all but one of the sections of Gochnatia, to examine evolutionary relationships among the taxa. Both cpDNA and nrDNA were used in a phylogenetic analysis using parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian approaches. The results suggest a non-monophyletic Gochnatia that is here resolved by the recognition of segregate genera. Morphological characters support these new genera and allow the adoption of a new classification for the Gochnatieae. A biogeographic analysis shows a possible southern South American/Andean origin followed by movement in three directions: into the Central Andes, into central and northern Brazil, and into Mexico and the Caribbean. The dating analysis gives an age of the split of the core Gochnatieae from the Wunderlichieae-Cyclolepis clade, and hence the age of the tribe, of 36-45 Ma and an age of 23-25 Ma for the first split within the core Gochnatieae (Andean vs. Brazil-Mexico-Caribbean). Cnicothamnus remains in Gochnatieae but Cyclolepis is designated incertae sedis. © International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) 2014.","Introduction: We propose that active Bayesian inference-a general framework for decision-making-can equally be applied to interpersonal exchanges. Social cognition, however, entails special challenges. We address these challenges through a novel formulation of a formal model and demonstrate its psychological significance. Method: We review relevant literature, especially with regards to interpersonal representations, formulate a mathematical model and present a simulation study. The model accommodates normative models from utility theory and places them within the broader setting of Bayesian inference. Crucially, we endow people's prior beliefs, into which utilities are absorbed, with preferences of self and others. The simulation illustrates the model's dynamics and furnishes elementary predictions of the theory. Results: (1) Because beliefs about self and others inform both the desirability and plausibility of outcomes, in this framework interpersonal representations become beliefs that have to be actively inferred. This inference, akin to \"mentalizing\" in the psychological literature, is based upon the outcomes of interpersonal exchanges. (2) We show how some well-known social-psychological phenomena (e.g., self-serving biases) can be explained in terms of active interpersonal inference. (3) Mentalizing naturally entails Bayesian updating of how people value social outcomes. Crucially this includes inference about one's own qualities and preferences. Conclusion: We inaugurate a Bayes optimal framework for modeling intersubject variability in mentalizing during interpersonal exchanges. Here, interpersonal representations are endowed with explicit functional and affective properties. We suggest the active inference framework lends itself to the study of psychiatric conditions where mentalizing is distorted. © 2014 Moutoussis, Trujillo-Barreto, El-Deredy, Dolan and Friston.","We study several Bayesian inference problems for irreversible stochastic epidemic models on networks from a statistical physics viewpoint. We derive equations which allow us to accurately compute the posterior distribution of the time evolution of the state of each node given some observations. At difference with most existing methods, we allow very general observation models, including unobserved nodes, state observations made at different or unknown times, and observations of infection times, possibly mixed together. Our method, which is based on the belief propagation algorithm, is efficient, naturally distributed, and exact on trees. As a particular case, we consider the problem of finding the \"zero patient\" of a susceptible-infected-recovered or susceptible-infected epidemic given a snapshot of the state of the network at a later unknown time. Numerical simulations show that our method outperforms previous ones on both synthetic and real networks, often by a very large margin. © 2014 American Physical Society.","A new species, Desmopachria andreae sp. n. is described from Cuba. Diagnostic characters including illustrations of male genitalia are provided and illustrated for the five species of the genus occurring on the island. For these five species both a simple key to adults and maps of their known distribution in Cuba are also provided. Using a Maximun Entropy method (MaxEnt), a distribution model was developed for D. andreae sp.n. Based on the model's predictions, this species has a higher probability of occurring in high altitude forests (above 1000 m a.s.l.), characterised by relatively low temperatures especially during the hottest and wettest seasons, specifically, the mountainous areas of the Macizo de Guamuhaya (Central Cuba), Sierra Maestra (S Cuba) and Nipe-Sagua-Baracoa (NE Cuba). In some of these areas the species has not yet been recorded, and should be searched for in future field surveys.

Rough Sets Theory (RST) has evolved into a methodology for dealing with different types of problems, such as the uncertainty produced by inconsistencies in data. RST is the best tool for modeling uncertainty when it shows up as inconsistency, according to several analyses. This is the main reason for which the RST has been included in the family of Soft Computing techniques. The classical RST is defined by using an equivalence relation as an indiscernibility relation. This is very restrictive in different domains, so several extensions of the theory have been formulated. One of these alternatives is based on a probabilistic approach, where several variants have been proposed such as the Variable Precision Rough Sets model, Rough Bayesian model, and Parameterized Rough Set model. Here is presented an analysis about the evolution of the RST in order to enrich the applicability to solve real problems by means of the probabilistic approaches of rough sets and its application to knowledge discovering and decision making, two main activities in Business Intelligence. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","Physically impaired people may use Surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals to control assistive devices in an automatic way. sEMG signals directly reflect the human motion intention, they can be used as input information for active exoskeleton control. This paper proposes a set of myoelectric algorithms based on machine learning for detecting movement intention aimed at controlling an upper limb active exoskeleton. The algorithms use a feature extraction stage based on a combination of time and frequency domain features (mean absolute value - waveform length, and auto-regressive model, respectively). The pattern recognition stage uses Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine and Bayesian classifiers. Additionally, two post-processing techniques are incorporated: majority vote and transition removal. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated with parameters of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, error rate and active error rate, under typical conditions. These evaluations allow identifying pattern recognition algorithms for real-time control of an active exoskeleton. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","We introduce a new generative model of the Encephalography (EEG/MEG) data, the inversion of which allows for inferring the locations and temporal evolution of the underlying sources as well as their dynamical interactions. The proposed Switching Mesostate Space Model (SMSM) builds on the multi-scale generative model for EEG/MEG by Daunizeau and Friston (2007). SMSM inherits the assumptions that (1) bioelectromagnetic activity is generated by a set of distributed sources, (2) the dynamics of these sources can be modelled as random fluctuations about a small number of mesostates, and (3) the number of mesostates engaged by a cognitive task is small. Additionally, four generalising assumptions are now included: (4) the mesostates interact according to a full Dynamical Causal Network (DCN) that can be estimated; (5) the dynamics of the mesostates can switch between multiple approximately linear operating regimes; (6) each operating regime remains stable over finite periods of time (temporal clusters); and (7) the total number of times the mesostates' dynamics can switch is small. The proposed model adds, therefore, a level of flexibility by accommodating complex brain processes that cannot be characterised by purely linear and stationary Gaussian dynamics. Importantly, the SMSM furnishes a new interpretation of the EEG/MEG data in which the source activity may have multiple discrete modes of behaviour, each with approximately linear dynamics. This is modelled by assuming that the connection strengths of the underlying mesoscopic DCN are time-dependent but piecewise constant, i.e. they can undergo discrete changes over time. A Variational Bayes inversion scheme is derived to estimate all the parameters of the model by maximising a (Negative Free Energy) lower bound on the model evidence. This bound is used to select among different model choices that are defined by the number of mesostates as well as by the number of stationary linear regimes. The full model is compared to a simplified version that uses no dynamical assumptions as well as to a standard EEG inversion technique. The comparison is carried out using an extensive set of simulations, and the application of SMSM to a real data set is also demonstrated. Our results show that for experimental situations in which we have some a priori belief that there are multiple approximately linear dynamical regimes, the proposed SMSM provides a natural modelling tool. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","In face processing tasks, prior presentation of internal facial features, when compared with external ones, facilitates the recognition of subsequently displayed familiar faces. In a previous ERP study ( Olivares & Iglesias, 2010) we found a visibly larger N400-like effect when identity mismatch familiar faces were preceded by internal features, as compared to prior presentation of external ones. In the present study we contrasted the processing of familiar and unfamiliar faces in the face-feature matching task to assess whether the so-called \"internal features advantage\" relies mainly on the use of stored face-identity-related information or if it might operate independently from stimulus familiarity. Our participants ( N=24) achieved better performance with internal features as primes and, significantly, with familiar faces. Importantly, ERPs elicited by identity mismatch complete faces displayed a negativity around 300-600msec which was clearly enhanced for familiar faces primed by internal features when compared with the other experimental conditions. Source reconstruction showed incremented activity elicited by familiar stimuli in both posterior (ventral occipitotemporal) and more anterior (parahippocampal (ParaHIP) and orbitofrontal) brain regions. The activity elicited by unfamiliar stimuli was, in general, located in more posterior regions. Ourfindings suggest that the activation of multiple neural codes is required for optimalindividuation in face-feature matching and that a cortical network related to long-term information for face-identity processing seems to support the internal feature effect. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","EF-hand calcium sensors respond structurally to changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, triggering diverse cellular responses and resulting in broad interactomes. Despite impressive advances in decoding their structure-function relationships, the folding mechanism of neuronal calcium sensors is still elusive. We used single-molecule optical tweezers to study the folding mechanism of the human neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS1). Two intermediate structures induced by Ca2+ binding to the EF-hands were observed during refolding. The complete folding of the C domain is obligatory for the folding of the N domain, showing striking interdomain dependence. Molecular dynamics results reveal the atomistic details of the unfolding process and rationalize the different domain stabilities during mechanical unfolding. Through constant-force experiments and hidden Markov model analysis, the free energy landscape of the protein was reconstructed. Our results emphasize that NCS1 has evolved a remarkable complex interdomain cooperativity and a fundamentally different folding mechanism compared to structurally related proteins. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","This article presents a comparative study of the performance of classification techniques used for fault diagnosis in industrial processes.

The introduction of a new virus with increased transmissibility into a population makes surveillance of the pandemic strain to the molecular level necessary. The aim of the present study was the molecular and phylogenetic analysis of pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains that circulated in Cuba between May 2009 and August 2010. Seventy clinical samples were included in the study. Nucleotide sequences from the hemagglutinin HA1 region segment were obtained directly from clinical samples. Genetic distances were calculated using MEGA v.5.05. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using MrBayes v.3.1.2 software. Potential N-glycosylation sites were predicted using NetNGlyc server 1.0. The 48 Cuban sequences of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 obtained were similar to the A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) vaccine strain. Most of the Cuban strains belonged to clade 7. Cuban viruses showed amino acid changes, some of them located at three antigenic sites: Ca, Sa, and Sb. Two dominant mutations were detected: P83S (100%) and S203T (85.7%). Glycosylation site analysis revealed the gain of one site at position 162 in 13 sequences. The findings in this study contribute to our understanding of the progress of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, since this virus is at the starting point of its evolution in humans. © 2013 International Society for Infectious Diseases.","Background:Infectious bursal disease is a highly contagious and acute viral disease caused by the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV); it affects all major poultry producing areas of the world. The current study was designed to rigorously measure the global phylogeographic dynamics of IBDV strains to gain insight into viral population expansion as well as the emergence, spread and pattern of the geographical structure of very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) strains.Methodology/Principal Findings:Sequences of the hyper-variable region of the VP2 (HVR-VP2) gene from IBDV strains isolated from diverse geographic locations were obtained from the GenBank database; Cuban sequences were obtained in the current work. All sequences were analysed by Bayesian phylogeographic analysis, implemented in the Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST), Bayesian Tip-association Significance testing (BaTS) and Spatial Phylogenetic Reconstruction of Evolutionary Dynamics (SPREAD) software packages. Selection pressure on the HVR-VP2 was also assessed. The phylogeographic association-trait analysis showed that viruses sampled from individual countries tend to cluster together, suggesting a geographic pattern for IBDV strains. Spatial analysis from this study revealed that strains carrying sequences that were linked to increased virulence of IBDV appeared in Iran in 1981 and spread to Western Europe (Belgium) in 1987, Africa (Egypt) around 1990, East Asia (China and Japan) in 1993, the Caribbean Region (Cuba) by 1995 and South America (Brazil) around 2000. Selection pressure analysis showed that several codons in the HVR-VP2 region were under purifying selection.Conclusions/Significance:To our knowledge, this work is the first study applying the Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction approach to analyse the emergence and spread of vvIBDV strains worldwide. © 2013 Alfonso-Morales et al.","Determining whether a conflict between gene trees and species trees represents incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) or hybridization involving native and/or invasive species has implications for reconstructing evolutionary relationships and guiding conservation decisions. Among vertebrates, turtles represent an exceptional case for exploring these issues because of the propensity for even distantly related lineages to hybridize. In this study we investigate a group of freshwater turtles (Trachemys) from a part of its range (the Greater Antilles) where it is purported to have undergone reticulation events from both natural and anthropogenic processes. We sequenced mtDNA for 83 samples, sequenced three nuDNA markers for 45 samples, and cloned 29 polymorphic sequences, to identify species boundaries, hybridization, and intergrade zones for Antillean Trachemys and nearby mainland populations. Initial coalescent analyses of phased nuclear alleles (using *BEAST) recovered a Bayesian species tree that strongly conflicted with the mtDNA phylogeny and traditional taxonomy, and appeared to be confounded by hybridization. Therefore, we undertook exploratory phylogenetic analyses of mismatched alleles from the \" coestimated\" gene trees (Heled and Drummond, 2010) in order to identify potential hybrid origins. The geography, morphology, and sampling context of most samples with potential introgressed alleles suggest hybridization over ILS. We identify contact zones between different species on Jamaica (T. decussata×T. terrapen), on Hispaniola (T. decorata×T. stejnegeri), and in Central America (T. emolli×T. venusta). We are unable to determine whether the distribution of T. decussata on Jamaica is natural or the result of prehistoric introduction by Native Americans. This uncertainty means that the conservation status of the Jamaican T. decussata populations and contact zone with T. terrapen are unresolved. Human-mediated dispersal events were more conclusively implicated for the prehistoric translocation of T. stejnegeri between Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, as well as the more recent genetic pollution of native species by an invasive pet turtle native to the USA (T. scripta elegans). Finally, we test the impact of introgressed alleles using the multispecies coalescent in a Bayesian framework and show that studies that do not phase heterozygote sequences of hybrid individuals may recover the correct species tree, but overall support for clades that include hybrid individuals may be reduced. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Brain Electric/Magnetic Tomography (BET /BMT) consists of a 3D-image reconstruction of the Primary Current Density inside the brain from the signals measured outside the head, which can be considered as a functional neuroimaging modality. Mathematically, this is known as the EEG/MEG inverse problem (IP), which is ill posed (non-unique solution). To find a unique BET/BMT, additional in-formation and proper models are needed, which has led to the development of several different methods for solving the IP. In this work we introduce Neuronic Source Localizer, which include some of the methods reported in the literature for computing BET/BMT, such as: Minimum Norm, Weighted Minimum Norm, Low Resolution Tomography (LORETA) and Bayesian Model Averaging. The system works with EEG and MEG data, in time and frequency domain. This system is a useful tool for cognitive and clinical re-searchers who study normal and abnormal brain processes such as cognition and epilepsy because it makes easier to com-pute BET/BMT in a few steps. © 2013 Springer.","Conservation planning and implementation require identifying pertinent habitats and locations where protection and management may improve viability of targeted species. The winter range of Bicknell's Thrush (Catharus bicknelli), a threatened Nearctic-Neotropical migratory songbird, is restricted to the Greater Antilles. We analyzed winter records from the mid-1970s to 2009 to quantitatively evaluate winter distribution and habitat selection. Additionally, we conducted targeted surveys in Jamaica (n = 433), Cuba (n = 363), Dominican Republic (n = 1,000), Haiti (n = 131) and Puerto Rico (n = 242) yielding 179 sites with thrush presence. We modeled Bicknell's Thrush winter habitat selection and distribution in the Greater Antilles in Maxent version 3.3.1. using environmental predictors represented in 30 arc second study area rasters. These included nine landform, land cover and climatic variables that were thought a priori to have potentially high predictive power. We used the average training gain from ten model runs to select the best subset of predictors. Total winter precipitation, aspect and land cover, particularly broadleaf forests, emerged as important variables. A five-variable model that contained land cover, winter precipitation, aspect, slope, and elevation was the most parsimonious and not significantly different than the models with more variables. We used the best fitting model to depict potential winter habitat. Using the 10 percentile threshold (>0.25), we estimated winter habitat to cover 33,170 km2, nearly 10% of the study area. The Dominican Republic contained half of all potential habitat (51%), followed by Cuba (15.1%), Jamaica (13.5%), Haiti (10.6%), and Puerto Rico (9.9%). Nearly one-third of the range was found to be in protected areas. By providing the first detailed predictive map of Bicknell's Thrush winter distribution, our study provides a useful tool to prioritize and direct conservation planning for this and other wet, broadleaf forest specialists in the Greater Antilles. © 2013 McFarland et al.","Introduction: renal anemia is a frequent complication among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The introduction of recombinant erythropoietin (rhuEpo) treatment has changed anemia management, but the therapeutic hemoglobin (Hb) target is still under debate, and clinical evidence for its effect on cardiac functions is in discussion. Objective: this study aimed to explore the effect of pre-dialysis erythropoiesisstimulating agent (ESA) use on the left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) or general and renal function protective effect in CKD3b-4 patients.

Results: the treatment significantly increased hematocrit (Htc) in all patients who completed the study (n = 33, 0.29 ± 0.02(V%) versus 0.38 ± 0.03, P (Wilcoxon)= 0.000. In the beginning 90,9% At the end only the 78.8% the patients had LVH, it was decreased 2.2 mm (14 a 11.8 mm), and significant reverse lineal correlation between the change in the LVH and Hb concentration was noted (r = -0.379; p = 0.030). Progression of the CKD was slow (mL/min). Diabetics 37.2 ± 8.4 versus 34.7 ± 6.7 (p Wilcoxon=0.119) non diabetics 35.1 ± 7.833.6 ± 7.7 (p Wilcoxon= 0.119). 48.5% of the patients had Adverse effects (AE). No patients died or started in dialysis. The Balance Benefit- Risk (AE moderate or severe) estimated from the Bayes Factor was evidence to the benefit (BF=1, 64). Conclusion: we observed that correction of anemia with rhuEpo in patients with CKD 3b seems to improve the LVH without another problems and it is beneficial. The results of this study support the treatment of severe anemia with EPO.","It is a common endeavor in medicine to identify and represent causal relationships between variables of interest. A computational representation of causal knowledge should be based on directed graphs. There are two main techniques: bayesian networks and fuzzy cognitive maps. The present paper compares the two techniques and shows the advantages of fuzzy cognitive maps. It is suggested that fuzzy cognitive maps be used in medicine. A procedure to obtain causal models is described. A case study is presented showing the applicability of the proposal, as well as the advantages of cognitive maps to represent causal knowledge in a given situation. Future research is proposed to expand the use of fuzzy cognitive maps.","This research presents a novel way of representing human motion and recognizing human activities from the skeleton output computed from RGB-D data from vision-based motion capture systems. The method uses a representation of the skeleton which is invariant to rotation and translation, based on Orthogonal Direction Change Chain Codes, as observations for a single Discrete Connected Hidden Markov Model formed by a set of multiple Hidden Markov Models for simple activities, which are merged using a grammar-based structure. The purpose of this research is to provide a service robot with the capability of human activity awareness, which can be used for action planning with implicit and indirect Human-Robot Interaction. © 2013 IEEE.","Noise reduction techniques are widely used for audio recording, image editing, and industrial signal processing. The idea is to reconstruct the original data from the noise-corruptec signal suppressing, all or almost all, the distortion caused by the inherent noise of the physical processes. In the present paper, we perform a comparative review of several noise reduction techniques based on adaptive threshold selection. These techniques have been extensively used for image processing. However, we aimed at evaluating their performance for industrial signal noise reduction. In particular, we analyze the behaviour of the Bayes Shrink, Normal Shrink, Modified Shrink, and Neight Shrink methods for the reduction of the Gaussian noise in industrial signals. To that aim, we perform experiments on a set of pattern signals proposed by Donoho and other representative measurements obtained from real processes in Cuban's Nickel plants. Our results indicate that, for this kind of data, the Neigh Shrink algorithm outperforms the other techniques. © 2013 CEA.","Electroencephalography (EEG) source localization in epileptology continues to be a challenge for neuroscientists. A number of inverse solution (IS) methodologies have been proposed to solve this problem, and their advantages and limitations have been described. In the present work, a previously developed IS approach called Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is introduced in clinical practice in order to improve the localization accuracy of epileptic discharge sources. For this study, 31 patients with the diagnosis of partial epilepsies were studied: 14 had benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes and 17 had temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The underlying epileptic sources were localized using the BMA approach, and the results were compared with those expected from the clinical diagnosis. Additional comparisons with results obtained from 3 of the most commonly used distributed IS methods for these purposes (minimum norm [MN], weighted minimum norm [WMN], and low-resolution electromagnetic tomography [LORETA]) were carried out in terms of source localization accuracy and spatial resolutions. The BMA approach estimated discharge sources that were consistent with the clinical diagnosis, and this method outperformed LORETA, MN, and WMN in terms of both localization accuracy and spatial resolution. The BMA was able to localize deeper generators with high accuracy. In conclusion, the BMA methodology has a great potential for the noninvasive accurate localization of epileptic sources, even those located in deeper structures. Therefore, it could be a promising tool for clinical practice in epileptology, although additional studies in other types of epileptic syndromes are necessary. © EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ECNS) 2013.","In the agricultural research, situations are presented where it is difficult to use the classical linear models of analysis of variance, because the assumptions of independence, equality of variances and linearity are not fulfilled by making measures repeated in time. This paper had as object to review the statistical procedures used to analyze the designs of measures repeated in time, and determine which analytical strategies are more appropriate for each purpose. In this study, three types of traditionally used analyses are described: univariate variance (ANOVA), multivariate variance (MANOVA), and the recent one, the approach of mixed models. At present, it has been agreed that the latter is the most adequate and versatile, because it provides the possibility of examining data with structures of dependence, unbalance, and lack of normality. Besides, it provides a solution to the limitation of the multivariate analysis of variance in respect to the number of individuals and variables. Also, the model of random effects is described, another member of the wide spectrum of the mixed models that is used in numerous studies in the agricultural field. This approach is strengthened by the use of selection criteria of models, due to the estimation of parameters is based on methods of maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) are described, permitting the optimum selection of competing mixed models.","In order to improve the ruminant feed evaluation techniques through a statistical method permitting the comparison of treatments in experiments of in vitro gas production, based on regression curves, data were collected from an experiment of in vitro gas production. The Gompertz function was fitted and the Monte Carlo simulation method was used, with the aim of analyzing the sensibility of four homogeneity tests of non-linear regression models. Thirteen new treatments were obtained, with 300 repetitions each and 280 points simulated per each repetition. The homogeneity tests were: extra sum of squares, Bayesian information criterion (BIC), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Akaike information criterion corrected (AICC). The comparison criteria were assessed with modifications to the parameters, on the order of 1, 3, 5, and 10 %. The methodology for the comparison of the curves was based on the definition of the complete and the reduced models. The sensibility of each method was established according to the probability of fulfillment of the null hypothesis. The AICC showed higher sensibility, followed by the test of extra sum of squares. The AIC and the BIC were the least sensible. The parameter that affected the most the differences between treatments was the asymptotic coefficient (A).","In Cuba, classical swine fever (CSF) has become an endemic disease with several outbreaks each year, despite the implemented vaccination program. Interestingly, a trend towards a milder presentation of the disease has been observed among the animals during the last years. This study aimed to assess positive selection pressure acting on partial E2 gene of CSF viruses to gain insights into the mechanisms governing virulence and the driving forces of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) evolution in swine populations under regular vaccination. Selection pressure analysis were performed to detect positive selection acting on a particular lineage as well as among sites of the E2-B/C-domain of CSFV nucleotide sequences, reported in a previous study and in the present work, several models, available in the CODEML module of PAML 4.3, were used. In addition, a representative Cuban CSF isolate was assessed in an experimental infection trial for their clinical virulence in order to expand the knowledge regarding CSF viruses circulating in pig populations. The viral genomes sequenced in this study were grouped in a defined cluster within the genotype 1.2, as it has been reported previously for Cuban CSF viruses. The selection pressure analysis didn't find evidence of positive selection (dN/dS of > 1) along any branch. The positive selective pressure analysis estimated six new sites under positive selection on E2 partial gene analysed. Besides, the clinical manifestations of the CSF-disease were related mainly to a mild course of the illness. The high number of positively selected sites suggests that these changes could be associated to viral evasion of the host-immune response. These observations highlight a possible association between escape viral variants and the alterations observed in the virulence and pathogenesis of the virus. Therefore, while the vaccination programs have not led to a genotype change, alterations in virulence were suggested to arise. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","A non Bayesian predictive approach for statistical calibration with functional data is introduced. This is based on extending to the functional calibration setting the definition of non Bayesian predictive probability density proposed by Harris (1989). The new method is elaborated in detail in case of Gaussian functional linear models. It is shown through numerical simulations that the introduced non Bayesian predictive estimator of the unknown parameter of interest in calibration (commonly, a substance concentration) has negligible bias and compares favorably with the classical estimator, particularly in extrapolation problems. A further advantage of the new approach, which is also briefly illustrated, is that it provides not only point estimates but also a predictive likelihood function that allows the researcher to explore the plausibility of any possible parameter value. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provide complementary noninvasive information of brain activity, and EEG/fMRI fusion can achieve higher spatiotemporal resolution than each modality separately. This focuses on independent component analysis (ICA)-based EEG/fMRI fusion. In order to appreciate the issues, we first describe the potential and limitations of the developed fusion approaches: fMRI-constrained EEG imaging, EEG-informed fMRI analysis, and symmetric fusion. We then outline some newly developed hybrid fusion techniques using ICA and the combination of data-/model-driven methods, with special mention of the spatiotemporal EEG/fMRI fusion (STEFF). Finally, we discuss the current trend in methodological development and the existing limitations for extrapolating neural dynamics. © 2012 Imperial College Press.","Recently proposed double-robust estimators for a population mean from incomplete data and for a finite number of counterfactual means can have much higher efficiency than the usual double-robust estimators under misspecification of the outcome model. In this paper, we derive a new class of double-robust estimators for the parameters of regression models with incomplete cross-sectional or longitudinal data, and of marginal structural mean models for cross-sectional data with similar efficiency properties. Unlike the recent proposals, our estimators solve outcome regression estimating equations. In a simulation study, the new estimator shows improvements in variance relative to the standard double-robust estimator that are in agreement with those suggested by asymptotic theory. © 2012 Biometrika Trust.","A non-Bayesian predictive approach for statistical calibration is introduced. This is based on particularizing to the calibration setting the general definition of non-Bayesian (or frequentist) predictive probability density proposed by Harris [Predictive fit for natural exponential families, Biometrika 76 (1989), pp. 675-684]. The new method is elaborated in detail in case of Gaussian linear univariate calibration. Through asymptotic analysis and simulation results with moderate sample size, it is shown that the non-Bayesian predictive estimator of the unknown parameter of interest in calibration (commonly, a substance concentration) favourably compares with previous estimators such as the classical and inverse estimators, especially for extrapolation problems. A further advantage of the non-Bayesian predictive approach is that it provides not only point estimates but also a predictive likelihood function that allows the researcher to explore the plausibility of any possible parameter value, which is also briefly illustrated. Furthermore, the introduced approach offers a general framework that can be applied for calibrating on the basis of any parametric statistical model, so making it potentially useful for nonlinear and non-Gaussian calibration problems. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","This paper proposes an approach that solves the Robot Localization problem by using a conditional state-transition Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Through the use of Self Organized Maps (SOMs) a Tolerant Observation Model (TOM) is built, while odometer-dependent transition probabilities are used for building an Odometer-Dependent Motion Model (ODMM). By using the Viterbi Algorithm and establishing a trigger value when evaluating the state-transition updates, the presented approach can easily take care of Position Tracking (PT), Global Localization (GL) and Robot Kidnapping (RK) with an ease of implementation difficult to achieve in most of the state-of-the-art localization algorithms. Also, an optimization is presented to allow the algorithm to run in standard microprocessors in real time, without the need of huge probability gridmaps. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","During the past three decades there has been a notable increase in dengue disease severity in Venezuela. Nevertheless, the population structure of the viruses being transmitted in this country is not well understood. Here, we present a molecular epidemiological study on dengue viruses (DENV) circulating in Aragua State, Venezuela during 2006-2007. Twenty-one DENV full-length genomes representing all of the four serotypes were amplified and sequenced directly from the serum samples. Notably, only DENV-2 was associated with severe disease. Phylogenetic trees constructed using Bayesian methods indicated that only one genotype was circulating for each serotype. However, extensive viral genetic diversity was found in DENV isolated from the same area during the same period, indicating significant in situ evolution since the introduction of these genotypes. Collectively, the results suggest that the non-structural (NS) proteins may play an important role in DENV evolution, particularly NS1, NS2A and NS4B proteins. The phylogenetic data provide evidence to suggest that multiple introductions of DENV have occurred from the Latin American region into Venezuela and vice versa. The implications of the significant viral genetic diversity generated during hyperendemic transmission, particularly in NS protein are discussed and considered in the context of future development and use of human monoclonal antibodies as antivirals and tetravalent vaccines. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","The concepts of causation and bias are crucial to modern biomedical research, ranging from the analysis of hundreds of exposure factors to megatrials, in order to assess the impact of interventions. As consumers of these research products, we are amazed that a statement made today is put into question tomorrow, discarded afterwards, and eventually retaken in the future from different perspectives or under different assumptions. Although the methodological bias is not the only culprit, it plays an important role as determinant of this reality. This paper intended to clarify the concept of bias, which is relevant, among other possible meanings, to contemporary biomedical research, and its association with the technical meaning of confounding. Other objectives were to present the current vision on the practical meaning of cause in epidemiological causal inference, and to critically review two modern analytical tools to deal with bias and causation such as propensity scores and instrumental variables.","In this paper, the \"mental map\" concept is positioned with regard to individual travel behaviour to start with. Based on Ogden and Richards' triangle of meaning (The meaning of meaning: a study of the influence of language upon thought and of the science of symbolism. International library of psychology, philosophy and scientific method. Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1966) distinct thoughts, referents and symbols originating from different scientific disciplines are identified and explained in order to clear up the notion's fuzziness. Next, the use of this concept in two major areas of research relevant to travel demand modelling is indicated and discussed in detail: spatial cognition and decision-making. The relevance of these constructs to understand and model individual travel behaviour is explained and current research efforts to implement these concepts in travel demand models are addressed. Furthermore, these mental map notions are specified in two types of computational models, i. e. a Bayesian Inference Network (BIN) and a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM). Both models are explained, and a numerical and a real-life example are provided. Both approaches yield a detailed quantitative representation of the mental map of decision-making problems in travel behaviour. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","We study the performance of different message passing algorithms in the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model. We show that the standard belief propagation (BP) algorithm converges only at high temperature to a paramagnetic solution. Then, we test a generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithm, derived from a cluster variational method (CVM) at the plaquette level. We compare its performance with BP and with other algorithms derived under the same approximation: double loop (DL) and a two-way message passing algorithm (HAK). The plaquette-CVM approximation improves BP in at least three ways: the quality of the paramagnetic solution at high temperatures, a better estimate (lower) for the critical temperature, and the fact that the GBP message passing algorithm converges also to nonparamagnetic solutions. The lack of convergence of the standard GBP message passing algorithm at low temperatures seems to be related to the implementation details and not to the appearance of long range order. In fact, we prove that a gauge invariance of the constrained CVM free energy can be exploited to derive a new message passing algorithm which converges at even lower temperatures. In all its region of convergence this new algorithm is faster than HAK and DL by some orders of magnitude. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.","The ITS2 gene class shows a high sequence divergence among its members that have complicated its annotation and its use for reconstructing phylogenies at a higher taxonomical level (beyond species and genus). Several alignment strategies have been implemented to improve the ITS2 annotation quality and its use for phylogenetic inferences. Although, alignment based methods have been exploited to the top of its complexity to tackle both issues, no alignment-free approaches have been able to successfully address both topics. By contrast, the use of simple alignment-free classifiers, like the topological indices (TIs) containing information about the sequence and structure of ITS2, may reveal to be a useful approach for the gene prediction and for assessing the phylogenetic relationships of the ITS2 class in eukaryotes. Thus, we used the TI2BioP (Topological Indices to BioPolymers) methodology [1,2], freely available at http://ti2biop.sourceforge.net/ to calculate two different TIs. One class was derived from the ITS2 artificial 2D structures generated from DNA strings and the other from the secondary structure inferred from RNA folding algorithms. Two alignment-free models based on Artificial Neural Networks were developed for the ITS2 class prediction using the two classes of TIs referred above. Both models showed similar performances on the training and the test sets reaching values above 95% in the overall classification. Due to the importance of the ITS2 region for fungi identification, a novel ITS2 genomic sequence was isolated from Petrakia sp. This sequence and the test set were used to comparatively evaluate the conventional classification models based on multiple sequence alignments like Hidden Markov based approaches, revealing the success of our models to identify novel ITS2 members. The isolated sequence was assessed using traditional and alignment-free based techniques applied to phylogenetic inference to complement the taxonomy of the Petrakia sp. fungal isolate. © 2011 Agüero-Chapin et al.","Background and Objectives: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes are relevant to epidemiological questions, vaccine development, and clinical management of chronic HCV infection. In the present work, we aimed at investigating HCV genotype, variability and genetic history of HCV isolates in Cuba from a sample of chronically infected patients. Material and Methods: A prospective study, involving 73 Cuban anti-HCV positive patients, was carried out. RT-PCR and phylogenetic analysis was employed to determine HCV genotypes. Divergence dates and demographic parameters in a Bayesian coalescent framework were estimated, as implemented in BEAST v1.4.8. Results: HCV RNA was undetectable in 15 patients that received antiviral therapy. All HCV RNA positive patients, 58, were infected with genotype 1, three of them with subtype 1a and 55 with subtype 1b. The analysis of the DNA sequence coding for a core fragment, spanning nt positions 435-816 (relative to strain H77), revealed high percent (96.7% ± 0.8%) nucleotide identity within Cuban HCV subtype 1b sequences. However, 56.7% and 20% of 30 analyzed individuals had changes in the core region in a six-month interval, at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively. Mutations involving aa changes were mainly found in the region encompassed between aa 70 and 106 of the core protein, with only one isolate showing a point mutation at position 43. Interestingly, some of the observed changes seem to be reversions and might in fact contribute to reducing the variability of this region. The estimated date for the most recent common ancestor of HCV genotype 1b Cuban isolates is 1969 (CI, 1953 to 1977). Discussion: Analysis of HCV core encoding sequences from chronic patients reveals mutability of genotype 1b isolates in Cuba, which seem to be predominant and rapidly multiplied during the eighty decade of last century, and might limit the benefits obtained from current antiviral therapy.","Starting from a cluster variational method, and inspired by the correctness of the paramagnetic ansatz [at high temperatures in general, and at any temperature in the two-dimensional (2D) Edwards-Anderson (EA) model] we propose a message-passing algorithm-the dual algorithm-to estimate the marginal probabilities of spin glasses on finite-dimensional lattices. We use the EA models in 2D and 3D as benchmarks. The dual algorithm improves the Bethe approximation, and we show that in a wide range of temperatures (compared to the Bethe critical temperature) our algorithm compares very well with Monte Carlo simulations, with the double-loop algorithm, and with exact calculation of the ground state of 2D systems with bimodal and Gaussian interactions. Moreover, it is usually 100 times faster than other provably convergent methods, as the double-loop algorithm. In 2D and 3D the quality of the inference deteriorates only where the correlation length becomes very large, i.e., at low temperatures in 2D and close to the critical temperature in 3D. © 2011 American Physical Society.","This is the final paper in a Comments and Controversies series dedicated to \"The identification of interacting networks in the brain using fMRI: Model selection, causality and deconvolution\". We argue that discovering effective connectivity depends critically on state-space models with biophysically informed observation and state equations.

We consider the similarities and differences among Dynamic Causal Modeling, Granger Causal Modeling and other approaches. We establish links between past and current statistical causal modeling, in terms of Bayesian dependency graphs and Wiener-Akaike-Granger-Schweder influence measures.

In this study, a comparison between methodologies based on classical phylogenetic trees and networks to infer the origin of PCV2 in Cuba was performed. In addition, the mechanisms supporting the genetic variability of Cuban PCV2 populations were investigated. A retrospective study, using pig sera collected in Cuba from 1993 to 2004, to evaluate the presence of PCV2 genome and PCV2-specific antibodies was also conducted and revealed a lack of evidence of PCV2 infection in Cuban swine from years 1993 to 2004. A total of 24 complete Cuban PCV2 sequences collected between 2005 and 2009 from different regions of the country were analyzed. Three classical methods of phylogenetic analysis, namely Neighbour-Joining, Maximum Parsimony and Bayesian Inference, as well as haplotype network construction, were used. Whereas the classical phylogenetic trees suggested different origins for the Cuban PCV2 strains, the haplotype network revealed a direct connection between all the Cuban sequences in agreement with the obtained epidemiological and viral sequence data. Moreover, the importation of pigs carried out in 2005 from the Quebec-Ontario region, Canada, seems to be the most likely origin of PCV2 in Cuba. Likewise, the genetic variability of Cuban PCV2 sequences was supported by geographic segregation and positive selection pressure with estimated rates of nucleotide substitution on the order of 3.12×10 -3 and 6.57×10 -3 substitutions/site/year, which are closer to those reported for RNA viruses. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","In the preset report, for the first time, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), Bayesian networks (BNs), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) are applied and compared on two \"in-house\" datasets to describe the tyrosinase inhibitory activity from the molecular structure. The data set Data I is used for the identification of tyrosinase inhibitors (TIs) including 701 active and 728 inactive compounds. Data II consists of active chemicals for potency estimation of TIs. The 2D TOMOCOMD-CARDD atom-based quadratic indices are used as molecular descriptors. The derived models show rather encouraging results with the areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AURC) curve in the test set above 0.943 and 0.846 for the Data I and Data II, respectively. Multiple comparison tests are carried out to compare the performance of the models and reveal the improvement of machine learning (ML) techniques with respect to statistical ones (see Chemometr. Intell. Lab. Syst. 2010, 104, 249). In some cases, these ameliorations are statistically significant. The tests also demostrate that k-NN, despite being a rather simple approach, presents the best behavior in both data. The obtained results suggest that the ML-based models could help to improve the virtual screening procedures and the confluence of these different techniques can increase the practicality of data mining procedures of chemical databases for the discovery of novel TIs as possible depigmenting agents.

Thus, the Topological Indices to BioPolymers (TI2BioP) methodology (Agüero-Chapin et al., 2010) inspired in both the TOPS-MODE and the MARCH-INSIDE methodologies allows the calculation of simple topological indices (TIs) as alignment-free classifiers. These indices were derived from the clustering of the amino acids into four classes of hydrophobicity and polarity revealing higher sequence-order information beyond the amino acid composition level. The predictability power of such TIs was evaluated for the first time on the RNase III family, due to the high diversity of its members (primary sequence and domain organization). Three non-linear models were developed for RNase III class prediction: Decision Tree Model (DTM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)-model and Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The first two are alignment-free approaches, using TIs as input predictors. Their performances were compared with a non-classical HMM, modified according to our amino acid clustering strategy. The alignment-free models showed similar performances on the training and the test sets reaching values above 90% in the overall classification. The non-classical HMM showed the highest rate in the classification with values above 95% in training and 100% in test. Although the higher accuracy of the HMM, the DTM showed simplicity for the RNase III classification with low computational cost. Such simplicity was evaluated in respect to HMM and ANN models for the functional annotation of a new bacterial RNase III class member, isolated and annotated by our group. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Many articles in \"in silico\" drug design implemented genetic algorithm (GA) for feature selection, model optimization, conformational search, or docking studies. Some of these articles described GA applications to quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) modeling in combination with regression and/or classification techniques.

Modeled data sets encompassed ADMET and solubility properties, cancer target inhibitors, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, HIV-1 protease inhibitors, ion-channel and calcium entry blockers, and antiprotozoan compounds as well as protein classes, functional, and conformational stability data. The GA-optimized predictors were often more accurate and robust than previous published models on the same data sets and explained more than 65% of data variances in validation experiments.

This study analyses the phylogeography of these species to assess possible colonization events from Central America to the islands and subsequent population expansions during glacial periods driven by both drier climate and larger emerged land areas. • Methods: Allele size data were obtained for plastid microsatellites for 314 individuals from 24 populations, covering the distribution range of subsection Australes in the Caribbean Basin. • Key Results: In total, 113 plastid haplotypes were identified. The highest genetic diversity was found in populations of P. caribaea. Overall, Caribbean Basin populations fit the isolation by distance model. Significant phylogeographical structure was found (RST 0·671 > permuted RST 0·101; P < 0·0001). The haplotype network and a Bayesian analysis of population structure (BAPS) indicated different Central American origins for P. caribaea var. bahamensis and P. caribaea var. caribaea plastids, with Central America populations in northern and south-eastern groups. Sudden expansion times for BAPS clusters were close to three glacial maxima. • Conclusions: Central America contains ancestral plastid haplotypes. Population expansion has played a major role in the distribution of genetic diversity in P. caribaea var. hondurensis. Two colonization events gave rise to the P. caribaea var. bahamensis and P. caribaea var. caribaea lineages. Plastid variation in the eastern species (P. cubensis, P. maestrensis and P. occidentalis) evolved independently from that in P. caribaea var. caribaea. Incomplete lineage sorting between P. cubensis and P. maestrensis is apparent. Inferred expansion times for P. caribaea var. bahamensis and for the eastern lineages correspond to glacial maxima, whereas those for P. caribaea var. hondurensis correspond to the beginning of the temperature decrease that led to Marine Isotope Stage 8. © The Author 2010.

Six different statistical models were used which had in common as fixed effects the contemporary groups (year-herd-season-sex) and the covariables, linear weaning age and mother's age at linear and quadratic calving. Model 1 only included the random effect of the animal, model 2 also included the random effect of permanent environment, model 3 was equal to 1 but also including the random maternal genetic effect, regardless of the existence of covariance between the additive and maternal effects, model 4 was equal to 3 but considering the existence of covariance between additive and maternal effects, models 5 and 6 were the same as models 3 and 4, respectively, but adding the random effect of permanent environment. Weaning weight averaged 159.7 kg, with a standard deviation of 26.7 kg. Three criteria to compare models were used the log-likelihood (log L), Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Model 1 was that of worst fit considering the three criteria. Taking into account the criterion log L models 5 and 6 did not differ significantly between them and were the best compared to the rest. AIC and BIC criteria indicate the model 5 as the best. Heritability for the direct additive effect (0.32) in modelo1 was higher than that estimated for the other models (0.02 to 0.06). Heritabilities estimated for maternal effects in models of best fit reached values of 0.06 (model 5) and 0.04 (model 6), which although higher than those of the direct effect are also low. Permanent environmental effects determined between 10.9% (model 6) and 15.4% (model 3) of the total variability. The genetic correlation between direct and maternal effects reached values of 0.53 and 0.61 for models 4 and 6, respectively. The results indicate that there is little possibility of improving the weaning weight by selection in the present population.","This article reviews progress and challenges in model driven EEG/fMRI fusion with a focus on brain oscillations. Fusion is the combination of both imaging modalities based on a cascade of forward models from ensemble of post-synaptic potentials (ePSP) to net primary current densities (nPCD) to EEG; and from ePSP to vasomotor feed forward signal (VFFSS) to BOLD. In absence of a model, data driven fusion creates maps of correlations between EEG and BOLD or between estimates of nPCD and VFFS. A consistent finding has been that of positive correlations between EEG alpha power and BOLD in both frontal cortices and thalamus and of negative ones for the occipital region. For model driven fusion we formulate a neural mass EEG/fMRI model coupled to a metabolic hemodynamic model. For exploratory simulations we show that the Local Linearization (LL) method for integrating stochastic differential equations is appropriate for highly nonlinear dynamics. It has been successfully applied to small and medium sized networks, reproducing the described EEG/BOLD correlations. A new LL-algebraic method allows simulations with hundreds of thousands of neural populations, with connectivities and conduction delays estimated from diffusion weighted MRI. For parameter and state estimation, Kalman filtering combined with the LL method estimates the innovations or prediction errors. From these the likelihood of models given data are obtained. The LL-innovation estimation method has been already applied to small and medium scale models. With improved Bayesian computations the practical estimation of very large scale EEG/fMRI models shall soon be possible. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","According to the data from the National Cancer Registry, breast and cervical cancer are the two most common nonskin cancers in Cuban woman.

The covariate 'urbanization level' was included in the Poisson-Lognormal and CAR models. The posterior probability of each municipality's relative risk (RR) exceeding unity was computed. Clusters were confirmed using the spatial scan statistic of Kulldorff. The CAR model provided the best fit for the geographical distribution of breast and cervical cancer in Cuba. For breast cancer, a high-risk region was identified in municipalities of Ciudad de La Habana province (CAR-smoothed RR between 1.21 and 1.26). Cervical cancer exhibited two areas with excess risk in the east and extreme west of the island (CAR-smoothed RR range 1.2-2.01 both areas together). Clusters were confirmed only for cervical cancer (P = 0.001 for the most likely cluster and P = 0.003 for a secondary cluster). In conclusion, the study supports the hypothesis of a spatial variation in risk at small area level essentially for cervical cancer and also for breast cancer that probably reflects the territorial distribution of life style and socioeconomic factors. This is the first attempt to introduce this methodology in the framework of the National Cancer Registry of Cuba and we expect to extend its use to forthcoming analyses. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","We assessed here true causal directionalities in cerebellar-motoneuron (MN) network associations during the classical conditioning of eyelid responses. For this, the firing activities of identified facial MNs and cerebellar interpositus (IP) nucleus neurons were recorded during the acquisition of this type of associative learning in alert behaving cats. Simultaneously, the eyelid conditioned response (CR) and the EMG activity of the orbicularis oculi (OO) muscle were recorded. Nonlinear association analysis and time-dependent causality method allowed us to determine the asymmetry, time delays, direction in coupling, and functional interdependences between neuronal recordings and learned motor responses.Weconcluded that the functional nonlinear association between the IP neurons andOOmuscle activities was bidirectional and asymmetric, and the time delays in the two directions of coupling always lagged the start of the CR. Additionally, the strength of coupling depended inversely on the level of expression of eyeblink CRs, whereas causal inferences were significantly dependent on the phase information status. In contrast, the functional association between OO MNs and OO muscle activities was unidirectional and quasisymmetric, and the time delays in coupling were always of opposed signs. Moreover, information transfer in cerebellar-MN network associations during the learning process required a \"driving common source\" that induced the mere \"modulating coupling\" of the IP nucleus with the final common pathway for the eyelid motor system. Thus, it can be proposed that the cerebellum is always looking back and reevaluating its own function, using the information acquired in the process, to play a modulatingreinforcing role in motor learning.

Methods: Sixty two long-term, socially-excluded heroin injectors, not benefiting from available treatments were randomized to receive either DAM or MMT for 9 months in Granada, Spain. Completers were 44 and data at the end of the study period was obtained for 50. Participants were determined to be responders or non responders using a multi-domain outcome index accounting for their physical and mental health and psychosocial integration, used in a previous trial. Data was analyzed with Bayesian methods, using information from a similar study conducted in The Netherlands to select a priori distributions. On adding the data from the present study to update the a priori information, the distribution of the difference in response rates were obtained and used to build credibility intervals and relevant probability computations. Results: In the experimental group (n = 27), the rate of responders to treatment was 70.4% (95% CI 53.287.6), and in the control group (n = 23), it was 34.8% (95% CI 15.354.3). The probability of success in the experimental group using the a posteriori distributions was higher after a proper sensitivity analysis. Almost the whole distribution of the rates difference (the one for diacetylmorphine minus methadone) was located to the right of the zero, indicating the superiority of the experimental treatment. Conclusion: The present analysis suggests a clinical superiority of injectable diacetylmorphine compared to oral methadone in the treatment of severely affected heroin injectors not benefiting sufficiently from the available treatments. © 2009 Perea-Milla et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Background: Aggressive non-melanoma skin cancer (deeply infiltrating, recurrent, and morphea form lesions) are therapeutically challenging because they require considerable tissue loss and may demand radical disfiguring surgery. Interferons (IFN) may provide a non-surgical approach to the management of these tumors. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of a formulation containing IFNs-α and -γ in synergistic proportions on patients with recurrent, advanced basal cell (BCC) or squamous cell skin carcinomas (SCSC). Methods: Patients with extensive, recurrent, resistant to other procedures BCC or SCSC received the IFN formulation peri- and intralesionally, three times per week for 3 weeks. They had been previously treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Thirteen weeks after the end of treatment, the original lesion sites were examined for histological evidence of remaining tumor. Results: Sixteen elder (median 70 years-old) patients were included. They beared 12 BCC and 4 SCSC ranging from 1.5 to 12.5 cm in the longest dimension. At the end of treatment 47% CR (complete tumor elimination), 40% PR (>30% tumor reduction), and 13% stable disease were obtained. None of the patients relapsed during the treatment period. The median duration of the response was 38 months. Only one patient with complete response had relapsed until today. Principal adverse reactions were influenza-like symptoms well known to occur with interferon therapy, which were well tolerated. Conclusion: The peri- and intralesional combination of IFNs-α and -γ was safe and showed effect for the treatment of advanced, recurrent and resistant to previous treatments of BCC and SCSC in elder patients. This is the first report of such treatment in patients with advance non-melanoma skin cancer. The encouraging result justifies further confirmatory trials. © 2009 Anasagasti-Angulo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Background. Neuromyelitis optica is a central nervous system demyelinating and inflammatory syndrome. The objective of this study is to identify cytokines related to the cellular immune response as well as blood brain barrier integrity and oxidative stress. Methods. We performed a molecular characterization of cellular immune response and oxidative stress in serum from relapsing-NMO (R-NMO) patients and established the correlations between the clinical measurements and molecular parameters using the Bayesian approach. Serum samples from 11 patients with R-NMO diagnosed according to Wingerchuk criteria and matched in terms of age, gender and ethnicity with the healthy controls were analyzed. The levels of TNF-, IFN-, IL-10, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and oxidative stress markers: malondialdehyde, advanced oxidation protein products, peroxidation potential, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and total hydroperoxides were measured. Results. We found almost undetectable levels of TNF-, a decreased production of IL-10 and a significant up-regulation of every oxidative stress biomarker studied. The insufficient production of TNF- and IL-10 in R-NMO patients, which are two important players of T cell mediated immunoregulation, suggest an effector-regulator imbalance. The overproduction of oxygen reactive species as a consequence of the chronic inflammatory milieu is reflected on the excess of oxidative damage mediators detected. Furthermore, Multidimensional Scaling and a Bayesian linear regression model revealed a significant linear dependence between Expanded Disability Status Scale Kurtzke and TIMP-1; pointing to a possible predictive or prognostic value of this clinical-molecular relationship. Conclusion. These results suggest that there is a breakdown in immunoregulatory mechanisms and noteworthy pro-oxidant environment contributing to NMO pathogenesis. © 2009 Pentn-Rol et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","empty","Digital Signal Processing (DSP) applications in Bioinformatics have received great attention in recent years, where new effective methods for genomic sequence analysis, such as the detection of coding regions, have been developed. The use of DSP principles to analyze genomic sequences requires defining an adequate representation of the nucleotide bases by numerical values, converting the nucleotide sequences into time series. Once this has been done, all the mathematical tools usually employed in DSP are used in solving tasks such as identification of protein coding DNA regions, identification of reading frames, and others. In this article we present an overview of the most relevant applications of DSP algorithms in the analysis of genomic sequences, showing the main results obtained by using these techniques, analyzing their relative advantages and drawbacks, and providing relevant examples. We finally analyze some perspectives of DSP in Bioinformatics, considering recent research results on algebraic structures of the genetic code, which suggest other new DSP applications in this field, as well as the new field of Genomic Signal Processing. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Alcohol is one of the most addicted drugs in history of mankind.

This adds a degree of flexibility when fitting the model to actual data by accounting for un-modelled activity. We then show how the innovation method can be used to estimate unobserved metabolic/hemodynamic as well as vascular variables of the sMHM, from simulated and actual BOLD data. The proposed estimation method allowed for doing model comparison by calculating the model's AIC and BIC. This methodology was then used to select between different neurovascular coupling assumptions underlying sMHM. The proposed framework was first validated on simulations and then applied to BOLD data from a motor task experiment. The models under comparison in the analysis of the actual data considered that vascular response was coupled to: (I) inhibition, (II) excitation, (III) both excitation and inhibition. Data was best described by model II, although model III was also supported. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.","In this study, commercially pure titanium (Ti-cp) discs were used as substrates. Octacalcium phosphate (OCP) layers were deposited by immersion of Ti-cp discs up to 7 days into Solution for Bioactivity Evaluation (SBE) and characterized by SEM-EDS and XRD.

In the last two decades, too many reports used MATLAB environment as an adequate platform for programming ANNs. Some of these reports comprise a variety of applications intended to quantitatively or qualitatively describe structure-activity relationships. A powerful tool is obtained when there are combined Bayesian-regularized neural networks (BRANNs) and genetic algorithm (GA): Bayesian-regularized genetic neural networks (BRGNNs). BRGNNs can model complicated relationships between explanatory variables and dependent variables. Thus, this methodology is regarded as useful tool for QSAR analysis. In order to demonstrate the use of BRGNNs, we developed a reliable method for predicting the antagonistic activity of 5-amino-3-arylisoxazole derivatives against Human Platelet Thrombin Receptor (PAR-1), using classical 3D-QSAR methodologies: Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) and Comparative Molecular Similarity Indices Analysis (CoMSIA). In addition, 3D vectors generated from the molecular structures were correlated with antagonistic activities by multivariate linear regression (MLR) and Bayesian-regularized neural networks (BRGNNs). All models were trained with 34 compounds, after which they were evaluated for predictive ability with additional 6 compounds. CoMFA and CoMSIA were unable to describe this structure-activity relationship, while BRGNN methodology brings the best results according to validation statistics. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","The introduction of support vector regression (SVR) and least square support vector machines (LS-SVM) methods for regression purposes in the field of chemometrics has provided advantageous alternatives to the existing linear and nonlinear multivariate calibration (MVC) approaches. Relevance vector machines (RVMs) claim the advantages attributed to all the SVM-based methods over many other regression methods. Additionally, it also exhibits advantages over the standard SVM-based ones since: it is not necessary to estimate the error/margin trade-off parameter C and the insensitivity parameter ε in regression tasks, it is applicable to arbitrary basis functions, the algorithm gives probability estimates seamlessly and offer, additionally, excellent sparseness capabilities, which can result in a simple and robust model for the estimation of different properties. This paper presents the use of RVMs as a nonlinearMVC method capable of dealing with ill-posed problems. To study its behavior, three different chemometric benchmark datasets are considered, including both linear and non-linear solutions. RVM was compared with other calibration approaches reported in the literature. Although RVM performance is comparable with the best results obtained by LS-SVM, the final model achieved is sparser, so the prediction process is faster. Taking into account the other advantages attributed to RVMs, it can be concluded that this technique can be seen as a very promising option to solve nonlinear problems in MVC.

We demonstrate that simultaneous phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast DNA (matK and rbcL) and nonmolecular characters that include both extant genera and a limited number of fossil taxa provide useful hypotheses for calibrating molecular trees. Root placements varied for Pinaceae, with Bayesian analyses recovering mutually monophyletic subfamilies Pinoideae and Abietoideae and parsimony analyses recovering Abietoideae as paraphyletic by placing the root between Cedrus and the remaining genera. The inferred phylogenetic positions of fossil taxa Pityostrobus bernissartensis as the sister group to Pinus and Pseudolarix erensis as the sister group to extant Pseudolarix were used to guide divergence-time calibrations; these calibrations yielded an Early Cretaceous and an Early Jurassic age for crown-group Pinaceae, respectively. The older age estimates based on Pseudolarix erensis are supported by weaker evidence from the fossil record but are consistent with recent reports of Early Cretaceous leaf fossils that appear to coincide with extant genera. There remains a great need to characterize the anatomy of extant and fossil species and to code additional nonmolecular characters. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

Myocardial revascularization surgery Is the most common of heart surgeries.To know the prevalence of major adverse events in this surgery and their risk factors, 1264 patients that were consecutively revascularized were prospectively studied between January 1990 and January 1996 in the Cardiology Institute of Havana City. METHODS. A multivariate analysis of the risk variables was made. Bayes' probabilities were obtained. The statistical significance level was p < 0.05. RESULTS. Major events were reported In 398 cases (32.1 %). The most frequent events were surgical reIntervention (234; 18.9%) and low cardiac output (190; 15.0 %). Most of Bayes' positive probabilities for the appearance of adverse events behaved as follows: left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 % (probability: 66.2 %) and peripheral arterial vascular insufficiency (probability: 58.8 %) (preoperative); low cardiac output (probability: 82.3 %) and surgical accidents (probability: 73.1 %) (transoperative); non-sinusal rhythms (probability: 88.9 %) and use of four or more units of hemoderlvatives (probability: 59.6 %) (postoperative). CONCLUSIONS. The adverse events behaved according to the ranges reported at the International level.","In this paper we introduce a new method to characterize the intravoxel anisotropy based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The proposed solution, under a fully Bayesian formalism, deals with the problem of joint Bayesian Model selection and parameter estimation to reconstruct the principal diffusion profiles or primary fiber orientations in a voxel. We develop an efficient stochastic algorithm based on the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) method in order to perform the Bayesian computation. RJMCMC is a good choice for this problem because of its ability to jump between models of different dimensionality. This methodology provides posterior estimates of the parameters of interest (fiber orientation, diffusivities etc) unconditional of the model assumed. It also gives an empirical posterior distribution of the number of primary nerve fiber orientations given the DWI data. Different probability maps can be assessed using this methodology: 1) the intravoxel fiber orientation map (or orientational distribution function) that gives the probability of finding a fiber in a particular spatial orientation; 2) a three-dimensional map of the probability of finding a particular number of fibers in each voxel; 3) a three-dimensional MaxPro (maximum probability) map that provides the most probable number of fibers for each voxel. In order to study the performance and reliability of the presented approach, we tested it on synthetic data; an ex-vivo phantom of intersecting capillaries; and DWI data from a human subject. © 2008.","A target-ligand QSAR approach using autocorrelation formalism was developed for modeling the inhibitory potency (pIC50) toward matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13) of N-hydroxy-2-[(phenylsulfonyl)amino]acetamide derivatives. Target and ligand structural information was encoded in the Topological Autocorrelation Interaction matrix calculated from 2D topological representation of inhibitors and protein sequences. The relevant Topological Autocorrelation Interaction descriptors were selected by genetic algorithm-based multilinear regression analysis and Bayesian-regularized genetic neural network approaches. A model ensemble strategy was employed for achieving robust and reliable linear and non-linear predictors having nine topological autocorrelation interaction descriptors with square correlation coefficients of ensemble test-set fitting (R2test) about 0.80 and 0.87, respectively. Electrostatic and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity properties were the most relevant on the optimum models. In addition, the distribution of the inhibition complexes on a self-organized map depicted target dependence rather than an inhibitor similarity pattern. © 2008 The Authors.","This paper presents a variational treatment of dynamic models that furnishes time-dependent conditional densities on the path or trajectory of a system's states and the time-independent densities of its parameters. These are obtained by maximising a variational action with respect to conditional densities, under a fixed-form assumption about their form. The action or path-integral of free-energy represents a lower bound on the model's log-evidence or marginal likelihood required for model selection and averaging. This approach rests on formulating the optimisation dynamically, in generalised coordinates of motion. The resulting scheme can be used for online Bayesian inversion of nonlinear dynamic causal models and is shown to outperform existing approaches, such as Kalman and particle filtering. Furthermore, it provides for dual and triple inferences on a system's states, parameters and hyperparameters using exactly the same principles. We refer to this approach as dynamic expectation maximisation (DEM). © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

QSAR models with considerable internal as well as external predictive ability were obtained. The relevant 2D autocorrelation descriptors for modeling CDK4/D inhibitory activity were selected by linear and nonlinear genetic algorithms (GAs) using multiple linear regression (MLR) and Bayesian-regularized genetic neural network (BRGNN) approaches, respectively. Both models showed good predictive statistics; but BRGNN model enables better external predictions. A weight-based input ranking scheme and Kohonen self-organized maps (SOMs) were carried out to interpret the final net weights. The 2D autocorrelation space brings different descriptors for CDK4/D inhibition, and suggests the atomic properties relevant for the inhibitors to interact with CDK4/D active site. CoMFA and CoMSIA analyses were developed with a focus on interpretative ability using coefficient contour maps. CoMSIA produced significantly better results. The results indicate a strong correlation between the inhibitory activity of the modeled compounds and the electrostatic and hydrophobic fields around them. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The key contribution is the automatic selection of multiple cortical sources with compact spatial support that are specified in terms of empirical priors. This obviates the need to use priors with a specific form (e.g., smoothness or minimum norm) or with spatial structure (e.g., priors based on depth constraints or functional magnetic resonance imaging results). Furthermore, the inversion scheme allows for a sparse solution for distributed sources, of the sort enforced by equivalent current dipole (ECD) models. This means the approach automatically selects either a sparse or a distributed model, depending on the data. The scheme is compared with conventional applications of Bayesian solutions to quantify the improvement in performance. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, nonlinear methods such as neural networks have been also introduced, and more recently support vector (SVR) based methods. This paper presents the application of relevance vector machines regression method (RVMR) as an alternative regression technique based on the Bayesian theory, for the prediction of physical-chemical properties from chemical spectroscopic data of different instrumental sources. In terms of measuring the real effectiveness and generalization capability of this approach, a comparison study of its performance with other known regression techniques are presented. The good results obtained in terms of root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) in the prediction of properties of interest, combined with the high sparseness capability exhibited, make this approach a good alternative to solve multivariate regression problems in practice. © 2008 IEEE.","A new methodology is introduced that characterizes the intravoxel orientation distribution function (ODF) based on a single-fiber model of the diffusion MRI signal. Using a Bayesian framework the probability of finding a fiber in a specific orientation is obtained. The proposed ODF estimation relies on a cigar-like diffusion tensor model, the methodology is thus denominated Bayesian cigar-like diffusion tensor (BCDT). This work makes two major contributions: 1) the study of single-fiber models in detecting fibers with different volume fractions in a voxel, and 2) the introduction of the Nth-root correction to improve the detection of fibers with smaller volume fractions, where N is the number of diffusion MRI measurements. It is demonstrated that the incomplete signal modeling fails to reconstruct the relative fiber volume fractions, especially when the intravoxel diffusion profiles have dissimilar contributions to the diffusion MRI signal. In this situation the fibers with smaller contributions are hardly detectable. The BCDT method proposed here reduces this effect by introducing the Nth-root correction, making multiple fibers estimable. The performance of the new methodology is illustrated using synthetic and real data, as well as the data from a phantom of intersecting capillaries. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","The study of type III RNases constitutes an important area in molecular biology. It is known that the pac1+ gene encodes a particular RNase III that shares low amino acid similarity with other genes despite having a double-stranded ribonuclease activity. Bioinformatics memods based on sequence alignment may fail when there is a low amino acidic identity percentage between a query sequence and others with similar functions (remote homologues) or a similar sequence is not recorded in the database. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) applied to protein sequences may allow an alignment-independent prediction of protein function. These sequences of QS AR-like methods often use 1D sequence numerical parameters as the input to seek sequence-function relationships. However, previous 2D representation of sequences may uncover useful higher-order information. In the work described here we calculated for the first time the spectral moments of a Markov matrix (MMM) associated with a 2D-HP-map of a protein sequence. We used MMMs values to characterize numerically 81 sequences of type III RNases and 133 proteins of a control group. We subsequently developed one MMM-QSAR and one classic hidden Markov model (HMM) based on the same data. The MMM-QSAR showed a discrimination power of RNAses from other proteins of 97.35% without using alignment, which is a result as good as for the known HMM techniques. We also report for the first time the isolation of a new Pac1 protein (DQ647826) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe strain 428-4-1. The MMM-QSAR model predicts the new RNase III with the same accuracy as other classical alignment methods. Experimental assay of this protein confirms me predicted activity. The present results suggest that MMM-QSAR models may be used for protein function annotation avoiding sequence alignment with the same accuracy of classic HMM models. © 2008 American Chemical Society.","This article proposes a Bayesian spatio-temporal model for source reconstruction of M/EEG data. The usual two-level probabilistic model implicit in most distributed source solutions is extended by adding a third level which describes the temporal evolution of neuronal current sources using time-domain General Linear Models (GLMs). These comprise a set of temporal basis functions which are used to describe event-related M/EEG responses. This places M/EEG analysis in a statistical framework that is very similar to that used for PET and fMRI. The experimental design can be coded in a design matrix, effects of interest characterized using contrasts and inferences made using posterior probability maps. Importantly, as is the case for single-subject fMRI analysis, trials are treated as fixed effects and the approach takes into account between-trial variance, allowing valid inferences to be made on single-subject data. The proposed probabilistic model is efficiently inverted by using the Variational Bayes framework under a convenient mean-field approximation (VB-GLM). The new method is tested with biophysically realistic simulated data and the results are compared to those obtained with traditional spatial approaches like the popular Low Resolution Electromagnetic TomogrAphy (LORETA) and minimum variance Beamformer. Finally, the VB-GLM approach is used to analyze an EEG data set from a face processing experiment. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The dark side is that, when lots of variables are involved, the learning of the network slows down and may lead to wrong results. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of applying an existing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based approach to feature selection for filtering the irrelevant attributes of the dataset, resulting in a fine Bayesian network built with the K2 algorithm. Empirical tests carried out with real data coming from the bioinformatics domain bear out that the PSO fitness function is in a straight concordance to the most widely known validation measures for classification. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.","We describe a Bayesian scheme to analyze images, which uses spatial priors encoded by a diffusion kernel, based on a weighted graph Laplacian. This provides a general framework to formulate a spatial model, whose parameters can be optimized. The application we have in mind is a spatiotemporal model for imaging data. We illustrate the method on a random effects analysis of fMRI contrast images from multiple subjects; this simplifies exposition of the model and enables a clear description of its salient features. Typically, imaging data are smoothed using a fixed Gaussian kernel as a pre-processing step before applying a mass-univariate statistical model (e.g., a general linear model) to provide images of parameter estimates. An alternative is to include smoothness in a multivariate statistical model (Penny, W.D., Trujillo-Barreto, N.J., Friston, K.J., 2005. Bayesian fMRI time series analysis with spatial priors. Neuroimage 24, 350-362). The advantage of the latter is that each parameter field is smoothed automatically, according to a measure of uncertainty, given the data. In this work, we investigate the use of diffusion kernels to encode spatial correlations among parameter estimates. Nonlinear diffusion has a long history in image processing; in particular, flows that depend on local image geometry (Romeny, B.M.T., 1994. Geometry-driven Diffusion in Computer Vision. Kluwer Academic Publishers) can be used as adaptive filters. This can furnish a non-stationary smoothing process that preserves features, which would otherwise be lost with a fixed Gaussian kernel. We describe a Bayesian framework that incorporates non-stationary, adaptive smoothing into a generative model to extract spatial features in parameter estimates. Critically, this means adaptive smoothing becomes an integral part of estimation and inference. We illustrate the method using synthetic and real fMRI data. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The molecular information has been encoded in 2D autocorrelation descriptors, obtained from different weighting schemes. The linear models were built by multiple linear regression (MLR) combined with genetic algorithm (GA), and a robust QSAR mapping paradigm.

All models were predictive according to internal and external validation experiments; but the best results correspond to nonlinear ones. The 2D autocorrelation space brings different descriptors for each MMP inhibition, and suggests the atomic properties relevant for the inhibitors to interact with each MMP active site. On the basis of the current results, the reported models have the potential to discover new potent and selective inhibitors and bring useful molecular information about the ligand specificity for MMP S1′ and S2′ subsites. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article we develop a recursive optimization algorithm based on the local linearization (LL) filter and an innovation method to make statistical inferences about the LEVC model from both EEG and fMRI data, i.e., to estimate the unobserved states and the unknown parameters of the model. For a better understanding, the LL filter is described from a Bayesian point of view, providing the particulars for the case of hybrid data (e.g., EEG and fMRI), which could be sampled at different rates. The dynamics of the exogenous synaptic inputs going into the cortical unit are also estimated by introducing a set of Gaussian radial basis functions. In order to study the dynamics of the electrical and vascular states in the striate cortex of humans as well as their local interrelationships, we applied this algorithm to EEG and fMRI recordings obtained concurrently from two subjects while passively observing a radial checkerboard with a white/black pattern reversal. The EEG and fMRI data from the first subject was used to estimate the electrical/vascular states and parameters of the LEVC model in Vl for a 4.0 Hz reversion frequency. We used the EEG data from the second subject to investigate the changes in the dynamics of the electrical states when the frequency of reversion is varied from 0.5-4.0 Hz. Then we made use of the estimated electrical states to predict the effects on the vasculature that such variations produce. © Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Multiple linear regression (MLR) combined with genetic algorithm (GA) and Bayesian-regularized Genetic Neural Networks (BRGNNs) were used to model the binding affinity (pKI) of 38 11,12-cyclic carbamate derivatives of 6-O-methylerythromycin A for the Human Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone (LHRH) receptor using quantum chemical descriptors. A multiparametric MLR equation with good statistical quality was obtained that describes the features relevant for antagonistic activity when the substituent at the position 3 of the erythronolide core was varied. In addition, four-descriptor linear and nonlinear models were established for the whole dataset. Such models showed high statistical quality. However, the BRGNN model was better than the linear model according to the external validation process. In general, our linear and nonlinear models reveal that the binding affinity of the compounds studied for the LHRH receptor is modulated by electron-related terms. © Springer-Verlag 2007.","The use of present pedagogical methods with Information and Communication Technologies produce a new quality that favors the task of generating, transmitting and sharing knowledge. That is the case of the pedagogical effect that produces the use of the Concept Maps, which are considered a learning technique as a way to increase meaningful learning in the sciences. It is also used for the knowledge management as an aid to personalize the Teaching-Learning process, to exchange knowledge, and to learn how to learn. Concept Maps provides a framework for making this internal knowledge explicit in a visual form that can easily be examined and shared. In this paper the authors present two different approaches to elaborate Intelligent Teaching-Learning Systems, in each approach Concept Maps and Artificial Intelligence are combined, using in the first one the Case-Based Reasoning and in the other Bayesian Networks as a knowledge representation forms and inference mechanisms for the decision making, supporting the Student Model. The authors also show the facilities and the difficulties they had using each Artificial Intelligence technique combined with Concept Maps. The proposed models have been implemented in the computational systems HESEI and MacBay, whose have been successfully used in the Teaching-Learning process by laymen in the Computer Science field to generate them owns adaptive systems. © 2008 IEEE.","This paper investigates the use of graph cuts for the minimization of an energy functional for road detection in satellite images, defined on the Bayesian MRF framework. The road identification process is modeled as a search for the optimal binary labeling of the nodes of a graph, representing a set of detected segments and possible connections among them. The optimal labeling corresponds to the configuration that minimizes an energy functional derived from a MRF probabilistic model, that introduces contextual knowledge about the shape of roads. We formulate an energy function modeling the interactions between road segments, while satisfying the regularity conditions required by the graph cuts based minimization. The obtained results show a noticeable improvement in terms of processing time, while achieving good results. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.","Authors had reported before two dual Boolean algebras to understand the underlying logic of the genetic code structure. In such Boolean structures, deductions have physico-chemical meaning. We summarize here that these algebraic structures can help us to describe the gene evolution process. Particularly in the experimental confrontation, it was found that most of the mutations of several proteins correspond to deductions in these algebras and they have a small Hamming distance related to their respective wild type. Two applications of the corresponding codification system in bioinformatics problems are also shown. The first one is the classification of mutations in a protein. The other one is related with the problem of detecting donors and acceptors in DNA sequences. Besides, pure mathematical models, Statistical techniques (Decision Trees) and Artificial Intelligence techniques (Bayesian Networks) were used in order to show how to accomplish them to solve these knowledge-discovery practical problems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.","When a tutoring aims to guide students in the teaching/learning process, it needs to know what knowledge the student has and what goals the student is currently trying to achieve. The Bayesian framework offers a number of techniques for inferring individual's knowledge state from evidence of mastery of concepts or skills. Using Bayesian networks, we have devised the probabilistic student models for MacBay, a tutoring system that is an authoring tool. MacBay's models provide prediction of student's action during teaching/learning process.

We propose edge detection parameters to measure the amount of entropy in the spatial and temporal domains. The shape of the membership functions is designed adaptively, according to those parameters and can be utilized to determine edge direction. Our proposed fuzzy edge direction detector operates by identifying small pixel variations in nine orientations in each domain and uses rules to infer the edge direction. We employ a Bayesian network, which provides accurate weightings between the proposed deinterlacing method and common existing deinterlacing methods. It successively builds approximations of the deinterlaced sequence by weighting interpolation methods. The results of computer simulations show that the proposed method outperforms a number of methods in the literature. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.","This paper proposes two parallel versions of an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) that represents the probability distribution by means of a single connected graphical model based on a polytree structure (PADA). The main goal is to design a new and more efficient EDA. Our algorithm (pPADA) is based on the master/slave model which allows to perform the estimation of the probability distribution (the most time-consuming phase in EDAs) in a parallel way. The aim of our experimental studies is manifold. Firstly, we show that our parallel versions achieve a notable reduction of the total execution time with respect to existing algorithms. Secondly, we study the behavior of the algorithm from the numerical point of view, analyzing the different versions. Finally, our methods are evaluated over three interconnection networks (Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, and Myrinet) and a study on the influence of the parallel platform in the communication is performed. © AEPIA.","The inhibition constant (Ki) of a set of 46 ketone-based cruzain inhibitors against cysteine protease cruzain was successfully modeled by means of data-diverse ensembles of Bayesian-regularized genetic neural networks. 2D spatial autocorrelation vectors were used for encoding structural information yielding a nonlinear model describing about 90 and 75% of ensemble training and test set variances, respectively. From the results of a ranking analysis of the neural network inputs, it was derived that atomic van der Waals volume distributions at topological lags 3, 5, and 6 in the 2D topological structure of the inhibitors have a high nonlinear influence on the inhibition constants. Furthermore, optimum subset of autocorrelation vectors well mapped the studied compounds according to their inhibition constant values in a Kohonen self-organizing map. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This is relevant when using the free energy as an approximation to the log-evidence in Bayesian model averaging and selection. By setting restricted maximum likelihood (ReML) in the larger context of variational learning and expectation maximisation (EM), we show how the ReML objective function can be adjusted to provide an approximation to the log-evidence for a particular model. This means ReML can be used for model selection, specifically to select or compare models with different covariance components. This is useful in the context of hierarchical models because it enables a principled selection of priors that, under simple hyperpriors, can be used for automatic model selection and relevance determination (ARD). Deriving the ReML objective function, from basic variational principles, discloses the simple relationships among Variational Bayes, EM and ReML. Furthermore, we show that EM is formally identical to a full variational treatment when the precisions are linear in the hyperparameters. Finally, we also consider, briefly, dynamic models and how these inform the regularisation of free energy ascent schemes, like EM and ReML. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In the BRGNN approach the Bayesian-regularization avoids overtraining/ overfitting and the genetic algorithm (GA) allows exploring an ample pool of 3D-descriptors. The predictive capacity of our selected model was evaluated by averaging multiple validation sets generated as members of diverse-training set neural network ensembles (NNEs). The ensemble averaging provides reliable statistics. When 40 members are assembled, the NNE provides a reliable measure of training and test set R values of 0.921 and 0.851 respectively. In other respects, the ability of the nonlinear selected GA space for differentiating the data was evidenced when the total data set was well distributed in a Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM). The location of the inhibitors in the map facilitates the analysis of the connection between compounds and serves as a useful tool for qualitative predictions.","Bayesian-regularized genetic neural networks (BRGNNs) were used to model the binding affinity (IC50) for 128 non-peptide antagonists for the human luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) receptor using 2D spatial autocorrelation vectors. As a preliminary step, a linear dependence was established by multiple linear regression (MLR) approach, selecting the relevant descriptors by genetic algorithm (GA) feature selection. The linear model showed to fit the training set (N = 102) with R2 = 0.746, meanwhile BRGNN exhibited a higher value of R2 = 0.871. Beyond the improvement of training set fitting, the BRGNN model overcame the linear one by being able to describe 85% of test set (N = 26) variance in comparison with 73% the MLR model. Our non-linear QSAR model illustrates the importance of an adequate distribution of atomic properties represented in topological frames and reveals the electronegativities, masses and polarizabilities as the most influencing atomic properties in the structures of the heterocycles under analysis for having an appropriate LHRH antagonistic activity.

For multidetermination applications, the normal choice is an array of potentiometric sensors to generate the signal, and an artificial neural network (ANN) correctly trained to obtain the calibration model. As a great amount of information is required for the proper modelling, we proposed its automated generation by using the sequential injection analysis (SIA) technique. First signals used were steady-state: the equilibrium signal after a step-change in concentration. We have now adapted our procedures to record the transient response corresponding to a sample step. The novelty in this approach is therefore the use of the dynamic components of the signal in order to better discriminate or differentiate a sample. In the developed electronic tongue systems, detection is carried out by using a sensor array formed by five potentiometric sensors based on PVC membranes. For the developed application we employed two different chloride-selective sensors, two nitrate-selective sensors and one generic response sensor. As the amount of raw data (fivefold recordings corresponding to the five sensors) is excessive for an ANN, some feature extraction step prior to the modelling was needed. In order to attain substantial data reduction and noise filtering, the data obtained were fitted with orthonormal Legendre polynomials. In this case, a third-degree Legendre polynomial was shown to be sufficient to fit the data. The coefficients of these polynomials were the input information fed into the ANN used to model the concentrations of the determined species (Cl-, NO3 - and HCO3-). Best results were obtained by using a backpropagation neural network trained with the Bayesian regularisation algorithm; the net had a single hidden layer containing three neurons with the tansig transfer function. The results obtained from the time-dependent response were compared with those obtained from steady-state conditions, showing the former superior performance. Finally, the method was applied for determining anions in synthetic samples and real water samples, where a satisfactory comparison was also achieved.

The relevant molecular descriptors were selected by linear and nonlinear genetic algorithm (GA) feature selection using multiple linear regression (MLR) and Bayesian-regularized neural network (BRANN) approaches, respectively. The quality of the models was evaluated by means of cross-validation experiments and the best results correspond to nonlinear ones (Q2 > 0.7 for all models). Despite the high correlation between the studied compound IC50 values, the 2D autocorrelation space brings different descriptors for each MMP inhibition. On the basis of these results, these models contain useful molecular information about the ligand specificity for MMP S1′, S1, and S2′ pockets. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This approach yielded reliable and robust models whilst by means of a linear genetic algorithm (GA) search routine no multilinear regression model was found describing more than 50% of the training set. On the contrary, the optimum neural network predictor with five inputs described about 84% and 65% variances of 50 randomly selected training and test sets. Autocorrelation vectors in the nonlinear model contained information regarding 2D spatial distributions on the CEB structure of van der Waals volumes, electronegativities, and polarizabilities. However, a sensitivity analysis of the network inputs pointed out to the electronegativity and polarizability 2D topological distributions at substructural fragments of sizes 3 and 4 as the most relevant features governing the nonlinear modeling of the negative inotropic potency. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The prevalence of non-specific low back pain is very high among the general population, and 60-70% of adults are believed to have suffered this problem at some time. Nevertheless, few randomised clinical trials have been made of the efficacy and efficiency of acupuncture with respect to acute low back pain. The present study is intended to assess the efficacy of acupuncture for acute low back pain in terms of the improvement reported on the Roland Morris Questionnaire (RMQ) on low back pain incapacity, to estimate the specific and non-specific effects produced by the technique, and to carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis. Methods/Design: Randomised four-branch controlled multicentre prospective study made to compare semi-standardised real acupuncture, sham acupuncture (acupuncture at non-specific points), placebo acupuncture and conventional treatment. The patients are blinded to the real, sham and placebo acupuncture treatments. Patients in the sample present symptoms of non specific acute low back pain, with a case history of 2 weeks or less, and will be selected from working-age patients, whether in paid employment or not, referred by General Practitioners from Primary Healthcare Clinics to the four clinics participating in this study. In order to assess the primary and secondary result measures, the patients will be requested to fill in a questionnaire before the randomisation and again at 3, 12 and 48 weeks after starting the treatment. The primary result measure will be the clinical relevant improvement (CRI) at 3 weeks after randomisation. We define CRI as a reduction of 35% or more in the RMQ results. Discussion: This study is intended to obtain further evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture on acute low back pain and to isolate the specific and non-specific effects of the treatment. © 2006 Vas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","The construction of three-dimensional images of the primary current density (PCD) produced by neuronal activity is a problem of great current interest in the neuroimaging community, though being initially formulated in the 1970s. There exist even now enthusiastic debates about the authenticity of most of the inverse solutions proposed in the literature, in which low resolution electrical tomography (LORETA) is a focus of attention. However, in our opinion, the capabilities and limitations of the electro and magneto encephalographic techniques to determine PCD configurations have not been extensively explored from a theoretical framework, even for simple volume conductor models of the head. In this paper, the electrophysiological inverse problem for the spherical head model is cast in terms of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) formalism, which allows us to identify the null spaces of the implicated linear integral operators and also to define their representers. The PCD are described in terms of a continuous basis for the RKHS, which explicitly separates the harmonic and non-harmonic components. The RKHS concept permits us to bring LORETA into the scope of the general smoothing splines theory. A particular way of calculating the general smoothing splines is illustrated, avoiding a brute force discretization prematurely. The Bayes information criterion is used to handle dissimilarities in the signal/noise ratios and physical dimensions of the measurement modalities, which could affect the estimation of the amount of smoothness required for that class of inverse solution to be well specified. In order to validate the proposed method, we have estimated the 3D spherical smoothing splines from two data sets: electric potentials obtained from a skull phantom and magnetic fields recorded from subjects performing an experiment of human faces recognition. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Development of novel computational approaches for modeling protein properties from their primary structure is a main goal in applied proteomics. In this work, we reported the extension of the autocorrelation vector formalism to amino acid sequences for encoding protein structural information with modeling purposes. Amino Acid Sequence Autocorrelation (AASA) vectors were calculated by measuring the autocorrelations at sequence lags ranging from 1 to 15 on the protein primary structure of 48 amino acid/residue properties selected from the AAindex database. A total of 720 AASA descriptors were tested for building predictive models of the thermal unfolding Gibbs free energy change of human lysozyme mutants. In this sense, ensembles of Bayesian-Regularized Genetic Neural Networks (BRGNNs) were used for obtaining an optimum nonlinear model for the conformational stability. The ensemble predictor described about 88% and 68% variance of the data in training and test sets, respectively. Furthermore, the optimum AASA vector subset was shown not only to successfully model unfolding thermal stability but also to distribute wild-type and mutant lysozymes on a stability Self-organized Map (SOM) when used for unsupervised training of competitive neurons. © 2006 American Chemical Society.","Antifungal activity was modeled for a set of 96 heterocyclic ring derivatives (2,5,6-trisubstituted benzoxazoles, 2,5-disubstituted benzimidazoles, 2-substituted benzothiazoles and 2-substituted oxazolo(4,5-b)pyridines) using multiple linear regression (MLR) and Bayesian-regularized artificial neural network (BRANN) techniques. Inhibitory activity against Candida albicans (log(1/C)) was correlated with 3D descriptors encoding the chemical structures of the heterocyclic compounds. Training and test sets were chosen by means of k-Means Clustering. The most appropriate variables for linear and nonlinear modeling were selected using a genetic algorithm (GA) approach. In addition to the MLR equation (MLR-GA), two nonlinear models were built, model BRANN employing the linear variable subset and an optimum model BRANN-GA obtained by a hybrid method that combined BRANN and GA approaches (BRANN-GA). The linear model fit the training set (n=80) with r2 = 0.746, while BRANN and BRANN-GA gave higher values of r2 = 0.889 and r2 = 0.937, respectively. Beyond the improvement of training set fitting, the BRANN-GA model was superior to the others by being able to describe 87% of test set (n=16) variance in comparison with 78 and 81% the MLR-GA and BRANN models, respectively. Our quantitative structure-activity relationship study suggests that the distributions of atomic mass, volume and polarizability have relevant relationships with the antifungal potency of the compounds studied.

As a preliminary step, linear dependences were established by multiple linear regression (MLR) approaches, selecting the relevant descriptors by genetic algorithm (GA) feature selection. For ANN models non-linear GA feature selection was also applied. Non-linear modeling of Ki overcame the results of the linear one using four properties, keeping in mind standard Pearson R correlation coefficients (0.931 vs. 0.862) and leave one out (LOO) cross-validation analysis (QLOO2=0.703vs.0.510). On the other hand, IC90 modeling was insoluble by a linear approach: no predictive model was achieved; however, a non-linear relation was encountered according to statistic results (R = 0.891; QLOO2=0.568). The best non-linear models suggested the influence of the presence of nitrogen atoms and the molecular volume distribution in the inhibitor structures on the HIV-1 protease inhibition as well as that the inhibition of HIV replication was dependent on the occurrence of five-member rings. Finally, inhibitors were well distributed regarding its activity levels in a Kohonen self-organizing map built using the input variables of the best non-linear models. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A linear model was unable to successfully fit the whole data set; however, the optimum Bayesian regularized neural network model described about 87% inhibitory activity variance with a relevant predictive power measured by q2 values of leave-one-out and leave-group-out cross-validations of about 0.7. According to their activity levels, thiol and non-thiol inhibitors were well-distributed in a topological map, built with the inputs of the optimum non-linear predictor. Furthermore, descriptors in the GNN model suggested the occurrence of a strong dependence of FT inhibition on the molecular shape and size rather than on electronegativity or polarizability characteristics of the studied compounds. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Importantly, we use a spatial prior on regression coefficients which embodies our prior knowledge that evoked responses are spatially contiguous and locally homogeneous. Further, using a computationally efficient Variational Bayes framework, we are able to let the data determine the optimal amount of smoothing. We assume an arbitrary order Auto-Regressive (AR) model for the errors. Our model generalizes earlier work on voxel-wise estimation of GLM-AR models and inference in GLMs using Posterior Probability Maps (PPMs).

A neural network monitoring scheme evidenced a highly non-linear dependence between the IKCa blocking activity and TCI descriptors. Suitable subsets of descriptors were selected by means of genetic algorithm. Bayesian regularization was implemented in the network training function with the aim of assuring good generalization qualities to the predictors. GNNs were able to yield a reliable predictor that explained about 97% data variance with good predictive ability. On the contrary, the best multivariate linear equation with descriptors selected by linear genetic search, only explained about 60%. In spite of when using the descriptors from the linear equations to train neural networks yielded higher fitted models, such networks were very unstable and had relative low predictive ability. However, the best GNN BRANN 2 had a Q2 of LOO of cross-validation equal to 0.901 and at the same time exhibited outstanding stability when calculating 80 randomly constructed training/ test sets partitions. Our model suggested that structural fragments of size three and seven have relevant influence on the inhibitory potency of the studied IKCa channel blockers. Furthermore, inhibitors were well distributed regarding its activity levels in a Kohonen self-organizing map (KSOM) built using the inputs of the best neural network predictor. © Springer 2005.","Artificial neural network ensembles were used for modeling the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition of 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives. The structural characteristics of these inhibitors were encoded in relevant 3D-spatial descriptors extracted by genetic algorithm feature selection. Bayesian-regularized multilayer neural networks, trained by the back-propagation algorithm, were developed using these variables as inputs. The predictive power of the model was tested by leave-one-out cross validation. In addition, for a more rigorous measure of the predictive capacity, multiple validation sets were randomly generated as members of neural network ensembles, which makes doing averaged predictions feasible. In this way, the predictive power was analyzed accounting for the averaged test set R values and test set mean-square errors. Otherwise, Kohonen self-organizing maps were used as an additional tool for the same modeling. The location of the inhibitors in a map facilitates the analysis of the connection between compounds and serves as a useful tool for qualitative predictions. © 2005 American Chemical Society.","Multivariate Autoregressive time series models (MAR) are an increasingly used tool for exploring functional connectivity in Neuroimaging. They provide the framework for analyzing the Granger Causality of a given brain region on others. In this article, we shall limit our attention to linear MAR models, in which a set of matrices of autoregressive coefficients Ak (k = 1 , . . .,p) describe the dependence of present values of the image on lagged values of its past. Methods for estimating the Ak and determining which elements that are zero are well-known and are the basis for directed measures of influence. However, to date, MAR models are limited in the number of time series they can handle, forcing the a priori selection of a (small) number of voxels or regions of interest for analysis. This ignores the full spatio-temporal nature of functional brain data which are, in fact, collections of time series sampled over an underlying continuous spatial manifold-the brain. A fully spatio-temporal MAR model (ST-MAR) is developed within the framework of functional data analysis. For spatial data, each row of a matrix Ak is the influence field of a given voxel. A Bayesian ST-MAR model is specified in which the influence fields for all voxels are required to vary smoothly over space. This requirement is enforced by penalizing the spatial roughness of the influence fields. This roughness is calculated with a discrete version of the spatial Laplacian operator. A massive reduction in dimensionality of computations is achieved via the singular value decomposition, making an interactive exploration of the model feasible. Use of the model is illustrated with an fMRI time series that was gathered concurrently with EEG in order to analyze the origin of resting brain rhythms. Copyright ©Humana Press Inc.

However, allopatric speciation may also occur in such situations, especially when ranges are fragmented by fluctuating water levels. We test the hypothesis that Miocene fragmentation of Cuba into three palaeo-archipelagos accompanied species-level divergence in the adaptive radiation of West Indian Anolis lizards. Analysis of morphology, mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) and nuclear DNA in the Cuban green anoles (carolinensis subgroup) strongly supports three predictions made by this hypothesis. First, three geographical sets of populations, whose ranges correspond with palaeo-archipelago boundaries, are distinct and warrant recognition as independent evolutionary lineages or species. Coalescence of nuclear sequence fragments sampled from these species and the large divergences observed between their mtDNA haplotypes suggest separation prior to the subsequent unification of Cuba ca. 5 Myr ago. Second, molecular phylogenetic relationships among these species reflect historical geographical relationships rather than morphological similarity. Third, all three species remain distinct despite extensive geographical contact subsequent to island unification, occasional hybridization and introgression of mtDNA haplotypes. Allopatric speciation initiated during partial island submergence may play an important role in speciation during the adaptive radiation of Anolis lizards. © 2004 The Royal Society.","Penalized likelihood estimated ages of both densely sampled intracontinental and sparsely sampled transcontinental crown clades in the legume family show a mostly Quaternary to Neogene age distribution. The mode ages of the intracontinental crown clades range from 4-6 Myr ago, whereas those of the transcontinental crown clades range from 8-16 Myr ago. Both of these young age estimates are detected despite methodological approaches that bias results toward older ages. Hypotheses that resort to vicariance or continental history to explain continental disjunct distributions are dismissed because they require mostly Palaeogene and older tectonic events. An alternative explanation centring on dispersal that may well explain the geographical as well as the ecological phylogenetic structure of legume phylogenies is Hubbell's unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography. This is the only dispersalist theory that encompasses evolutionary time and makes predictions about phylogenetic structure.","A genetic paradox exists in invasion biology: how do introduced populations, whose genetic variation has probably been depleted by population bottlenecks, persist and adapt to new conditions? Lessons from conservation genetics show that reduced genetic variation due to genetic drift and founder effects limits the ability of a population to adapt, and small population size increases the risk of extinction. Nonetheless, many introduced species experiencing these same conditions during initial introductions persist, expand their ranges, evolve rapidly and become invasive. To address this issue, we studied the brown anole, a worldwide invasive lizard. Genetic analyses indicate that at least eight introductions have occurred in Florida from across this lizard's native range, blending genetic variation from different geographic source populations and producing populations that contain substantially more, not less, genetic variation than native populations. Moreover, recently introduced brown anole populations around the world originate from Florida, and some have maintained these elevated levels of genetic variation. Here we show that one key to invasion success may be the occurrence of multiple introductions that transform among-population variation in native ranges to within-population variation in introduced areas. Furthermore, these genetically variable populations may be particularly potent sources for introductions elsewhere. The growing problem of invasive species introductions brings considerable economic and biological costs. If these costs are to be mitigated, a greater understanding of the causes, progression and consequences of biological invasions is needed.","In the dynamical inverse problem of electroencephalogram (EEG) generation where a specific dynamics for the electrical current distribution is assumed, we can impose general spatiotemporal constraints onto the solution by casting the problem into a state space representation and assuming a specific class of parametric models for the dynamics. The Akaike Bayesian Information Criterion (ABIC), which is based on the Type II likelihood, was used to estimate the parameters and evaluate the model. In addition, dynamic low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), a new approach for estimating the current distribution is introduced. A recursive penalized least squares (RPLS) step forms the main element of our implementation. To obtain improved inverse solutions, dynamic LORETA exploits both spatial and temporal information, whereas LORETA uses only spatial information. A considerable improvement in performance compared to LORETA was found when dynamic LORETA was applied to simulated EEG data, and the new method was applied also to clinical EEG data. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","In this paper, the Bayesian Theory is used to formulate the Inverse Problem (IP) of the EEG/MEG. This formulation offers a comparison framework for the wide range of inverse methods available and allows us to address the problem of model uncertainty that arises when dealing with different solutions for a single data. In this case, each model is defined by the set of assumptions of the inverse method used, as well as by the functional dependence between the data and the Primary Current Density (PCD) inside the brain. The key point is that the Bayesian Theory not only provides for posterior estimates of the parameters of interest (the PCD) for a given model, but also gives the possibility of finding posterior expected utilities unconditional on the models assumed. In the present work, this is achieved by considering a third level of inference that has been systematically omitted by previous Bayesian formulations of the IP. This level is known as Bayesian model averaging (BMA). The new approach is illustrated in the case of considering different anatomical constraints for solving the IP of the EEG in the frequency domain. This methodology allows us to address two of the main problems that affect linear inverse solutions (LIS): (a) the existence of ghost sources and (b) the tendency to underestimate deep activity. Both simulated and real experimental data are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the BMA approach, and some of the results are compared with the solutions obtained using the popular low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) and its anatomically constraint version (cLORETA). © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

It is based on a time-frequency decomposition of the EEG time series, which is measured by several electrodes in the scalp surface, and includes the computation of a statistic that measures the deviations of the log-power with respect to the pre-stimulus average; the computation of a significance index for these deviations; a new type of display (the time-frequency-topography plot) for the visualization of these indices, and the segmentation of the time-frequency plane into regions with uniform activation patterns.

Cerebrovascular disease causes different cognitive alterations. There is a need to develop tools that are capable of diagnosing them. One of them could be event-related potentials. These provide an indicator of cognitive processing in real time. Patients and methods. A study was conducted of 10 patients with cerebral infarction in the frontal region and 10 paired healthy controls. Evaluation of the patients was performed a week after the stroke. A continuous performance test was applied to both groups together with the recording of the electrical activity in the brain in order to obtain the P300 component. The results were submitted to the non-parametric Student's t test, and the Bayesian model averaging method (BMAM) was employed to calculate the sources generating the electrical activity recorded on the electroencephalogram. Results. Patients displayed significantly poorer performances compared to the healthy controls in the attention test. The BMAM showed that the P300 component was related to the right-hand temporal structures in healthy controls, whereas the left temporoparietal regions were also involved in the patients. Conclusions. These findings indicate the existence of subclinical disorders affecting sustained attention and that they can only be detected by very sensitive tools; furthermore, they also have implications for the brain circuits regulating sustained attention and the P300 component.","Genetic variability within the Cuban population of the white shrimp Litopenaeus schmitti (Burkenroad, 1936) was assessed using five microsatellite loci and samples collected from four sites (Batabanó, Cienfuegos, Tunas de Zaza, and Manzanillo) from November 1999 to March 2000. All loci were polymorphic, and a total of 80 alleles were found, 13 of them private alleles occurring only in a single population and always in low frequencies. The Cienfuegos sample had the highest observed heterozygosity (Ho = 0.653), and the Tunas de Zaza sample had the lowest values (Ho = 0.605), but there were no significant differences among samples in heterozygosity or in the mean numbers of alleles per locus (ranging from 11.0 to 11.6). Significant differentiation among populations was detected (F ST = 0.012, P < 0.001). Low but significant FST values were revealed in pairwise comparisons between populations. Assignation tests correctly assigned high percentages of individuals to their original populations (74.5%) using a Bayesian approach. The significant differentiation among populations could be due to the restriction of gene flow among populations of L. schmitti and is concordant with previous allozyme studies on Cuban populations.","Objective. To describe the use of conventional tests of statistical significance and the current trends shown by their use in three biomedical journals read in Spanish-speaking countries. Methods. All descriptive or explanatory original articles published in the five-year period of 1996 through 2000 were reviewed in three journals: Revista Cubana de Medicina General Integral [Cuban Journal of Comprehensive General Medicine], Revista Panamericana de Salud Pública/Pan American Journal of Public Health, and Medicina Clínica [Clinical Medicine] (which is published in Spain). Results. In the three journals that were reviewed various shortcomings were found in their use of hypothesis tests based on P values and in the limited use of new tools that have been suggested for use in their place: confidence intervals (CIs) and Bayesian inference. The basic findings of our research were: minimal use of CIs, as either a complement to significance tests or as the only statistical tool; mentions of a small sample size as a possible explanation for the lack of statistical significance; a predominant use of rigid alpha values; a lack of uniformity in the presentation of results; and improper reference in the research conclusions to the results of hypothesis tests. Conclusions. Our results indicate the lack of compliance by authors and editors with accepted standards for the use of tests of statistical significance. The findings also highlight that the stagnant use of these tests continues to be a common practice in the scientific literature.","In this paper, a new procedure is presented which allows the estimation of the states and parameters of the hemodynamic approach from blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses. The proposed method constitutes an alternative to the recently proposed Friston [Neuroimage 16 (2002) 513] method and has some advantages over it. The procedure is based on recent groundbreaking time series analysis techniques that have been, in this case, adopted to characterize hemodynamic responses in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This work represents a fundamental improvement over existing approaches to system identification using nonlinear hemodynamic models and is important for three reasons. First, our model includes physiological noise. Previous models have been based upon ordinary differential equations that only allow for noise or error to enter at the level of observation. Secondly, by using the innovation method and the local linearization filter, not only the parameters, but also the underlying states of the system generating responses can be estimated. These states can include things like a flow-inducing signal triggered by neuronal activation, de-oxyhemoglobine, cerebral blood flow and volume. Finally, radial basis functions have been introduced as a parametric model to represent arbitrary temporal input sequences in the hemodynamic approach, which could be essential to understanding those brain areas indirectly related to the stimulus. Hence, thirdly, by inferring about the radial basis parameters, we are able to perform a blind deconvolution, which permits both the reconstruction of the dynamics of the most likely hemodynamic states and also, to implicitly reconstruct the underlying synaptic dynamics, induced experimentally, which caused these states variations. From this study, we conclude that in spite of the utility of the standard discrete convolution approach used in statistical parametric maps (SPM), nonlinear BOLD phenomena and unspecific input temporal sequences must be included in the fMRI analysis. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

It is based on a time-frequency decomposition of the EEG time series, which is measured at a number of electrodes in the skull surface, and includes: the computation of a statistic that measures the deviations of the log-power with respect to the pre - stimulus average; the computation of a significance index for these deviations, and the segmentation of the time-frequency plane into regions with uniform activation patterns.

The approximate prediction and filter estimates are obtained by applying the optimal linear filter to the piecewise linear state space model that emerges from a local linearization of both the non-linear state equation and the non-linear measurement equation. In addition, the solutions of the differential equations that describe the evolution of the first two conditional moments between observations are obtained, and an algorithm for their numerical computation is also given. The performance of the LL filters is illustrated by mean of numerical experiments.","empty","Within the framework of a generalization of Rose's integrated parametric model (IPM) to the Gaussian mixture hidden Markov model (HMM) formulation to model speech in noisy environments, we further extend an algorithm for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the noise HMM component. We propose (1) a gain normalization algorithm in the log filterbank domain, which uses a gain estimate that is less degraded in broadband noise conditions, (2) the use of an augmented feature to incorporate dynamic information, which enables the use of the same probability density computation as the instantaneous feature, and (3) a technique for unsupervised noise model estimation using a phone loop grammar, which does not require an initial recognition pass. This algorithm does not require speech/nonspeech detection. In noisy digit recognition experiments, using HTK and NOISEX-92 database, the noise estimation algorithm achieves, in supervised and unsupervised, cases, performance similar to using noise models trained with the noise source data only. © 2003 IEEE.","This paper deals with the estimation of the state variable of continuous-discrete linear state space models with multiplicative noise.

To estimate the yearly number of people in Cuba who are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and were infected through sexual contact but who have not developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Estimation was made directly from the yearly HIV seroprevalence data of the Cuban Partner Notification Programme from 1991 to 2000. Methods. The generalized removal model for open populations is utilized for the estimation. The total number of known HIV-infected Cubans at each sampling time is used in the prior to provide more reasonable approximations. Results. We estimated a yearly survival rate of 93%. The median estimates for the number of all living asymptomatic HIV-positive Cubans, infected by sexual contact, tripled from 714 in 1991 to 2170 in 2000. The number of unknown HIV-positive Cubans infected sexually is estimated to range from 174 in 1991 to 401 in 2000. Conclusions. A consistent increase in the number of sexually infected HIV-positive individuals in Cuba from 1991 to 2000 is evident from the estimates. From 1996 onwards more sexually active homosexual/bisexual contacts were traced and consequently more sexually-infected HIV-positives were detected. A consequence of increased detection is the levelling off and subsequent decrease in the number of unknown HIV-positives during this time period. The estimation procedure is useful in estimating prevalent population sizes of epidemiological and public health interest.","It is known that skin cancer is the most frequent in men. The present increase of its incidence affects considerably the working adult population with its economic and social repercussions and the consequent deterioration of the quality of life. Its mortality is low, but its functional, morphological and aesthetic alterations are important and the cost of its treatment is high in many countries. Sun exposure is considered as the main carcinogen, since this risk factor is present in the occupation of the individual, without forgetting the diversity of known industrial carcinogens and the multifactorial etiology of this disease. A review of the topic is made to stress the force of association of the occupational risk and the participation of other risk factors depending on individuality, environment (non occupational sun exposure) and lifestyle from an occupational point of view to have better causal inferences in the epidemiological surveillance of the disease.","The serious objections made with regard to significance tests account for the necessity of employing another inferential procedure. Bayesian methods are free of such objections, and they provide a very attractive alternative. By means of a simple example, this article illustrates how a typical problem of medical research could be solved using these two approaches. Bayesian methods offer more information and are more useful than conventional ones for analyzing experimental outcomes. In addition, a natural interpretation of conclusions are given by Bayesian methods. Finally, modern computational programs allow us to solve their complex calculation.","This paper presents an algorithm for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the noise hidden Markov model (HMM) parameters in the context of model-based techniques. It is applied when only the clean speech HMM and noisy speech adaptation data are available. The noisy speech model is a generalizatirin of Rose's Integrated Parametric Model to the gaussian mixture HMM formulation. Observations from clean speech HMM and noise HMM models are combined in the log spectra domain, through a corruption function, to generate noisy speech observations. The estimation algorithm uses the \"max\" approximation as the corruption function. Noisy digit recognition experiments, with NOISEX-92, show that the same performance is achieved between the proposed model using either the estimated noise model from a single noisy utterance or a noise model calculated from silent sections of several utterances.","This paper presents a generalization of Rose's Integrated Parametric Model to the Gaussian mixture hidden Markov model (HMM), formulation.

At each stage of the evolution they build a polytree from which new points are sampled. We study empirically the relation between the accuracy of the learned model and the quality of the new search points generated. We show that a change of the learned model before sampling might reduce the population size requirements of sampling. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.","empty","When testing a new drug, the researcher faces the ethical and technical problem of incorporating the existing knowledge derived from previous trials, from a meta-analysis or simply from his subjective judgement. This paper proposes a non-Bayesian method based on the beta-binomial distribution, which can be used in the clinical trial of a drug or treatment when the response variable is dichotomous. The method consists in the modeling of the previous knowledge by means of the beta distribution in the assessment of both toxicity and efficacy, and a statistical test of efficacy, which depends on a parameter of the beta-binomial distribution.","The well-known neural mass model described by Lopes da Silva et al. (1976) and Zetterberg et al. (1978) is fitted to actual EEG data. This is achieved by reformulating the original set of integral equations as a continuous-discrete state space model. The local linearization approach is then used to discretize the state equation and to construct a nonlinear Kalman filter. On this basis, a maximum likelihood procedure is used for estimating the model parameters for several EEG recordings. The analysis of the noise-free differential equations of the estimated models suggests that there are two different types of alpha rhythms: those with a point attractor and others with a limit cycle attractor. These attractors are also found by means of a nonlinear time series analysis of the EEG recordings. We conclude that the Hopf bifurcation described by Zetterberg et al. (1978) is present in actual brain dynamics.","empty","A new approach for EEG segmentation is introduced. This is based on a methodology for optimal segmentation of non-stationary signals derived from the maximum a posteriori estimation principle. It is a model-based, not sequential approach that allows for segmentation at different resolution levels. The features of the methodology are illustrated by its application to EEG recordings containing several types of spectral changes due to normal and pathological variations of spontaneous brain rhythmic activities, as well as physiological artifacts. © 1995."],"palabras":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"brain executive functions;
