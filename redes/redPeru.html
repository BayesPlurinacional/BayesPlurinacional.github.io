Reliability evaluation of composite power systems is a valuable tool for identifying possible deficiencies in operation. Power systems operation is becoming more variable and stochastic. Consequently, there is an urgent need to update the tools used to analyze their reliability. This article presents a novel method based on cluster-based stratified sampling (CBSS) and sequential Monte Carlo simulations (SMCS) to improve the reliability evaluation of composite power systems. Here, clustering algorithms are applied to reduce the number of observations required by traditional SMCS. The proposed approach is applied to RTS-79, RTS-96, and RTS-GMLC electrical networks to verify its accuracy and speed. The results obtained demonstrate that CBSS increase calculation speed in highly reliable networks, while preserving information on the probability distribution of the reliability indices. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","<b>Land Suitability for Cocoa Cultivation in Peru: AHP and MaxEnt Modeling in a GIS Environment<\/b><br><br>Peru is one of the world’s leading exporters of cocoa beans, which directly impacts the household economy of millions of small farmers. Currently, the expansion and modernization of the cocoa-growing area require the zoning of the territory with suitable biophysical and infrastructural conditions to facilitate optimizing productivity factors. Therefore, we analyzed land suitability for cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) production on the Peruvian mainland as a support measure for sustainable agriculture. To this end, the climatological, edaphological, orographic, and socioeconomic criteria determining sustainable cocoa cultivation were identified and mapped. Three modeling approaches (Analytic Hierarchy Process—AHP, Maximum Entropy—MaxEnt, and AHP—MaxEnt combined) were further used to hierarchize the importance of the criteria and to model the potential territory for sustainable cocoa cultivation. In all three modeling approaches, climatological criteria stood out among the five most important criteria. Elevation (orographic criteria) is also featured in this group. On the other hand, San Martin and Amazonas emerged as the five regions with the largest area ‘Highly suitable’ for cocoa cultivation in all three modeling approaches, followed by Loreto, Ucayali, Madre de Dios, Cusco, Junín, and Puno, which alternated according to modeling approach. From most to least restrictive, the AHP, MaxEnt, and AHP–MaxEnt modeling approaches indicate that 1.5%, 5.3%, and 23.0% of the Peruvian territory is ‘Highly suitable’ for cocoa cultivation, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.","<b>Genome-Wide Identification and Analysis of DOF Gene Family in Eugenia uniflora L. (Myrtaceae)<\/b><br><br>Eugenia uniflora is a Brazilian native plant species with great ecological and economic importance. It is distributed throughout the Atlantic forest, where two distinct populations show local adaptation to the contrasting conditions of restinga and riparian forest. Among various TFs described in plants, the DOF TF family has been reported to affect flowering and vascular development, making them promising candidates for characterization in E. uniflora. In this study, 28 DOF genes were identified by a genome-wide analysis, of which 20 were grouped into 11 MCOGs by Bayesian phylogeny, suggesting a shared functionallity between members. Based on RNA-seq experiments, we have detected eight drought responsive genes, and SNPs identification revealed population unique polymorphisms, implying a role in local adapatation mechanisms. Finally, analysis of conserved motifs through MEME revealed 15 different protein motifs, and a promoter region analysis returned 40 enriched TF binding motifs, both reporting novel biological functions circa the DOF gene family. In general, the DOF family is found to be conserved both in sequence and expression. Furthermore, this study contributes to both DOF literature and the genetic exploration of native species, elucidating their genetic potential and bringing to light new research topics, paving the way to future studies. © 2022 by the authors.","<b>Predicting potential distribution and identifying priority areas for conservation of the Yellow-tailed Woolly Monkey (Lagothrix flavicauda) in Peru<\/b><br><br>Species distribution models (SDMs) provide conservationist with spatial distributions estimations of priority species. Lagothrix flavicauda (Humboldt, 1812), commonly known as the Yellow-tailed Woolly Monkey, is one of the largest primates in the New World. This species is endemic to the montane forests of northern Peru, in the departments of Amazonas, San Martín, Huánuco, Junín, La Libertad, and Loreto at elevation from1,000 to 2,800 m. It is classified as “Critically Endangered” (CR) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as well as by Peruvian legislation. Furthermore, it is listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Research on precise estimates of its potential distribution are scare. Therefore, in this study we modeled the potential distribution area of this species in Peru, the model was generated using the MaxEnt algorithm, along with 80 georeferenced occurrence records and 28 environmental variables. The total distribution (high, moderate, and low) for L. flavicauda is 29,383.3 km2, having 3,480.7 km2 as high potential distribution. In effect, 22.64 % (6,648.49 km2) of the total distribution area of L. flavicauda is found within Natural Protected Areas (NPAs), with the following categories representing the largest areas of distribution: Protected Forests (1,620.41 km2), Regional Conservation Areas (1,976.79 km2), and Private Conservation Areas (1,166.55 km2). After comparing the predicted distribution with the current NPAs system, we identified new priority areas for the conservation of the species. We, therefore, believe that this study will contribute significantly to the conservation of L. flavicauda in Peru. © 2022","<b>Geographic inequalities in health intervention coverage – mapping the composite coverage index in Peru using geospatial modelling<\/b><br><br>Background: The composite coverage index (CCI) provides an integrated perspective towards universal health coverage in the context of reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health. Given the sample design of most household surveys does not provide coverage estimates below the first administrative level, approaches for achieving more granular estimates are needed. We used a model-based geostatistical approach to estimate the CCI at multiple resolutions in Peru. Methods: We generated estimates for the eight indicators on which the CCI is based for the departments, provinces, and areas of 5 × 5 km of Peru using data from two national household surveys carried out in 2018 and 2019 plus geospatial covariates. Bayesian geostatistical models were fit using the INLA-SPDE approach. We assessed model fit using cross-validation at the survey cluster level and by comparing modelled and direct survey estimates at the department-level. Results: CCI coverage in the provinces along the coast was consistently higher than in the remainder of the country. Jungle areas in the north and east presented the lowest coverage levels and the largest gaps between and within provinces. The greatest inequalities were found, unsurprisingly, in the largest provinces where populations are scattered in jungle territory and are difficult to reach. Conclusions: Our study highlighted provinces with high levels of inequality in CCI coverage indicating areas, mostly low-populated jungle areas, where more attention is needed. We also uncovered other areas, such as the border with Bolivia, where coverage is lower than the coastal provinces and should receive increased efforts. More generally, our results make the case for high-resolution estimates to unveil geographic inequities otherwise hidden by the usual levels of survey representativeness. © 2022, The Author(s).","<b>World historical mapping and potential distribution of Cinchona spp. in Peru as a contribution for its restoration and conservation<\/b><br><br>Peru is a megadiverse country in neotropical flora and is home to an important genus of plants called Cinchona and commonly all its individual species are called Cinchona Tree (Cinchona spp.), which represents the national tree for this nation. This country has 18 species, a group of these species are listed as vulnerable, endangered, and their population trend is currently unknown. This genus is at risk of extinction due to overexploitation for its medicinal, constructive and food uses. The IUCN also mentions that increased species assessments and records will help make the IUCN Red List a “barometer of life”. Based on the fact that understanding the effects of environmental change on ecosystems requires the identification of historical and current baselines, which can act as reference conditions, this research generated georeferenced global historical maps of Cinchona spp. and then determined the appropriate sites based on environmental variables using the MaxEnt software and established the probabilities of occurrence of this genus in Peru to establish priority areas for its conservation and restoration. Four maps were obtained, one for each centennial, from 1737 to the present, with 10 860 occurrences of Cinchona. In the MaxEnt modeling, 10.30 % (13 3172.56 km2) and 19.20 % (24 7371.32 km2) of Peru's surface area had high ( > 0.6) and moderate (0.4–0.6) probabilities, respectively, of hosting Cinchona. Only 7.6 % (17 305.32 km2) and 22.0 % (50 153.73 km2) of the areas with high and moderate distribution potential, respectively, were covered by natural protected areas. Likewise, 11.90 % (21 738.75 km2) and 33.20 % (60 789.17 km2) of the high and moderate probability lands, respectively, correspond to degraded areas (DAs) and, therefore, are considered a priority for restoration with Cinchona spp. The results may stimulate the rethinking of decision making for the National Action Plan for Reforestation with Species of the Genus Cinchona and other plans or tools for Cinchona conservation in Peru. © 2022 The Author(s)","<b>Zero and One Inflated Item Response Theory Models for Bounded Continuous Data<\/b><br><br>Bounded continuous data are encountered in many applications of item response theory, including the measurement of mood, personality, and response times and in the analyses of summed item scores. Although different item response theory models exist to analyze such bounded continuous data, most models assume the data to be in an open interval and cannot accommodate data in a closed interval. As a result, ad hoc transformations are needed to prevent scores on the bounds of the observed variables. To motivate the present study, we demonstrate in real and simulated data that this practice of fitting open interval models to closed interval data can majorly affect parameter estimates even in cases with only 5% of the responses on one of the bounds of the observed variables. To address this problem, we propose a zero and one inflated item response theory modeling framework for bounded continuous responses in the closed interval. We illustrate how four existing models for bounded responses from the literature can be accommodated in the framework. The resulting zero and one inflated item response theory models are studied in a simulation study and a real data application to investigate parameter recovery, model fit, and the consequences of fitting the incorrect distribution to the data. We find that neglecting the bounded nature of the data biases parameters and that misspecification of the exact distribution may affect the results depending on the data generating model. © 2022 The Author(s).","<b>The oxygen minimum zone relative depth is a key driver of dolphin habitats in the northern Humboldt Current System<\/b><br><br>Highly mobile odontocetes need habitats with environmental conditions with the potential of aggregating enough and high-quality prey, to maximize foraging success. Until now, the characterization of those habitats was in terms of physical and biological indicators of high production, capable of attracting and sustaining prey. Nevertheless, there has been no approach to quantifying the effects of a biophysical characteristic of the ocean with proven effects on the vertical distribution of prey for cetaceans: The oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) depth. In the northern branch of the Humboldt Current System off Peru (~6-18° S), a shallow OMZ (30-50 m) affects the distribution of the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens), main prey for several marine predators, including dolphins. We hypothesized these predators would aggregate in productive areas, but with preference for places where the relative OMZ depth can constrain prey vertically, making it more accessible and maximizing foraging success. We fitted Bayesian habitat models for three dominant odontocete species in this region, with multiple combinations of environmental covariates, smoothing techniques, and temporal and spatial random effects. Cetacean data came from 23 dedicated surveys spanning 2001-2019. Habitat predictors included the spatial anomalies of sea surface temperature, surface chlorophyl-a, pycnocline depth and OMZ depth. Dusky (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) and common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) preferred productive, cold areas with a very shallow OMZ, regardless of the season, while bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) aggregated in both cold and warm waters, also with shallow OMZ. The former two species of higher metabolic demands would maximize energy intake by selecting areas with highly aggregated prey, while the latter, of more moderate metabolic needs and more diverse prey, would exploit less restricted habitats.

The low genetic diversity observed in the Chilean populations has been associated with the over-exploitation of natural beds and/or the founder effect that occurred during post-glacial colonization from New Zealand. How these processes have affected its evolutionary trajectory before farming and incipient domestication is poorly understood. In this study, we used 2232 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to assess how the species' evolutionary history in New Zealand (its region of origin), the founder effect linked to transoceanic dispersion and colonization of South America, and the recent over-exploitation of natural populations have influenced the genetic architecture of G. chilensis in Chile. The contrasting patterns of genetic diversity and structure observed between the two main islands in New Zealand attest to the important effects of Quaternary glacial cycles on G. chilensis. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) analyses indicated that Chatham Island and South America were colonized independently near the end of the Last Glacial Maximum and emphasized the importance of coastal and oceanic currents during that period. Furthermore, ABC analyses inferred the existence of a recent and strong genetic bottleneck in Chile, matching the period of over-exploitation of the natural beds during the 1970s, followed by rapid demographic expansion linked to active clonal propagation used in farming. Recurrent genetic bottlenecks strongly eroded the genetic diversity of G. chilensis prior to its cultivation, raising important challenges for the management of genetic resources in this incipiently domesticated species. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","<b>Phylogeny of Telmatobius marmoratus complex (Anura, Telmatobiidae) reveals high cryptic diversity in the Andean Altiplano<\/b><br><br>Telmatobius is the most diverse group of anurans in the Andean Altiplano (highlands) Morphologically, these amphibians have a generally conserved morphology but in turn present large intraspecific variation, which has led to a complex taxonomy and systematics. T. marmoratus has the widest distribution of the genus and forms a complex composed of at least two Telmatobius species. Partial systematic studies based on molecular evidence reveal the existence of three lineages with a complex spatial distribution. However, these studies did not include the entire distribution of T. marmoratus. Our study aims to reassess the current systematic scenario including the complete distribution of the complex. For this, we used a multilocus approach based on mitochondrial (16S, Cytb) and nuclear (RAG1-1, BFIB) DNA sequences to build a phylogenetic hypothesis based on Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony. Subsequently, we performed single-locus (ABGD and PTP) and multilocus (STACEY) species delimitation analyses to verify the diversity of nominal species within the complex. The analyses suggest seven non-sibling lineages and 6–10 candidate species within the marmoratus complex. Only one of the two lineages restricted to the central northern plateau correspond to T. marmoratus sensu stricto. South-central marbled water frogs belong to completely new lineages closer to T. gigas and T. culeus, evidencing the polyphyletic condition of the marmoratus complex. The findings of several sympatric lineages in some localities reveal a complex history of ancient water connections in south-central Altiplano. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","<b>On outliers detection and prior distribution sensitivity in standard skew-probit regression models<\/b><br><br>Regression models with probit and logit link functions are the most frequently used for binary response variables. However, traditional approaches may not be adequate when data are unbalanced. This paper deals with standard skew-probit regression models. Parameters were estimated through a new Bayesian approach which consists of the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and the original likelihood function. Simulation studies assessed the efficiency of the estimation method and the sensitivity of prior distributions for parameters related to asymmetry calculating the RMSE (root mean square error). The proposed estimation method was compared when used for detecting outliers. The results show that the proposed method is more efficient than INLA and is successful in the recovery of true parameter values. The sensitivity study enabled the proposal of a new prior distribution configuration for the asymmetry parameter, and the randomized quantile residual proved to be more suitable for detecting outliers. The methodology was applied to a diabetes dataset towards illustrating the results. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2022.","<b>Population structure and demographic history of the gastropod Thaisella chocolata (Duclos, 1832) from the Southeast Pacific inferred from mitochondrial DNA analyses<\/b><br><br>The present-day population structure of a species reflects the combination of oceanographic currents, life-history traits, and historical events. However, little is known about the mechanisms that have shaped the gene lineage distribution of marine species inhabiting the Southeast Pacific. Here, we provide a comprehensive phylogeographical study of a species distributed along the Southeast Pacific coastal region by analyzing the endemic gastropod Thaisella chocolata (Duclos, 1832). Sequencing of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) and 16S rRNA revealed strikingly high haplotypic nucleotide and genetic diversity but a lack of significant population differentiation within the survey area. In addition, a star-shaped phylogeny and significantly negative Tajima's D and Fu's Fs tests of neutrality suggested historical occurrence of rapid demographic expansion. Mismatch distributions and Bayesian inference analyses also confirmed T. chocolata to have undergone two ancestral demographic expansions. Calculations suggested that these expansions began in the lower and middle Pleistocene epoch, likely due to continental shelf development and climatic conditions. These findings could help establish a genetic baseline for T. chocolata as the first step toward sustainable spatial management of this species, as well as understand this species’ response to future climate change. © 2022 The Authors.

In this study, we found six additional species of host plants for D. (A.) dodona belonging to the genus Malesherbia (Passifloraceae). We used mitochondrial DNA sequences (COI) and microsatellites to screen genetic variation and investigate population structure in six geographic disjointed populations of D. (A.) dodona associated with distinct Malesherbia species. The PCoA analysis based on allele frequencies evidenced a lack of differentiation among populations and a low FST. The Bayesian cluster analyses revealed the existence of three genetically distinct groups, but almost all individuals present an admixture ancestry. An absence of isolation by distance pattern was observed. Possible scenarios are discussed: a bottleneck or recent colonization from interconnected populations from the south, and ongoing gene flow among local populations by high dispersal through a landscape formed of isolated populations of Malesherbia. © 2022 by the authors.","<b>Social Support and Resilience as Predictors of Prosocial Behaviors before and during COVID-19<\/b><br><br>The objective of this research was to analyze the relationship between social support and resilience with prosocial behavior before and during the confinement caused by COVID-19. Materials and Methods: The participants were divided into a confined group (228 women and 84 men) and an unconfined group (153 women and 105 men), all of whom were university students. Instruments were applied to measure the variables proposed. Results: Social support predicted 24.4% of the variance in prosocial behavior among women and 12% among men in the confined group; no evidence of this relationship was found in the unconfined groups. Resilience predicted 7% of the variance in prosocial behavior among confined women, 8.4% among confined men, 8.8% among unconfined women, and 5.1% in unconfined men. Discussion and Conclusion: The results show the importance of social support and resilience in prosocial behaviors, which are key elements for the proper functioning of society, especially in the face of a crisis such as COVID-19. © 2022 by the authors.","<b>Elucidating a history of invasion: population genetics of pirarucu (Arapaima gigas, Actinopterygii, Arapaimidae) in the Madeira River<\/b><br><br>The spread of non-native fish species is increasing globally and threatening aquatic ecosystems. Identifying the origins, the pathways, and vectors is crucial for managing biological invasions. We conducted a genetic characterization of Arapaima gigas from the Madeira River, considering native and non-native populations, to elucidate the invasion of the upper and middle Madeira River basin by A. gigas. We analyzed 9 microsatellite loci of 141 individuals from native (lower Madeira) and invasive (upper Madeira) populations, in addition to a locality from Peru outside the Madeira River basin drainage area, that previously was suggested to be one of the possible origins of the invasion. The results of discriminant analysis of principal components, Bayesian modeling of population structure, clustering and assignment tests (using microsatellite data from other Amazon locations) showed a clear separation between native and invasive populations and revealed a mixture of individuals from upper and middle Madeira and Peru. We confirm that the invasive population originates from Peru and was introduced by fish escapees from farms. Multiple secondary introductions may have advanced the invasion speed. Such a scenario represents a conservation paradox, because in its native habitat, A. gigas is endangered, whereas it has become invasive in non-native areas. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>The New Composite Solar Flare Index from Solar Cycle 17 to Cycle 24 (1937 – 2020)<\/b><br><br>The chromosphere is a highly dynamic outer plasma layer of the Sun. Its physical processes accounting for the variability are poorly understood. We reconstructed the solar chromospheric flare index (SFI) to study the solar chromospheric variability from 1937 to 2020. The new SFI database is a composite record of the Astronomical Institute Ondřejov Observatory of the Czech Academy of Sciences from 1937 – 1976 and the records of the Kandilli Observatory of Istanbul, Turkey from 1977 – 2020. The SFI records are available in daily, monthly, and yearly resolutions. We carried out the time-frequency analyses of the new 84-year long SFI records using the wavelet transform. We report the periodicities of 21.88 (Hale cycle), 10.94 (Schwabe cycle), 5.2 (quasi-quinquennial cycle), 3.5, 1.7, 1, 0.41 (or 149.7 days, Rieger cycle), 0.17 (62.1 days), 0.07 (25.9 days, solar rotational modulation) years. All these periodicities seem always present and persistent throughout the observational interval. Thus, we suggest that there is no reason to assume these solar periodicities are absent from other solar cycles. Time variations of the amplitude of each oscillation or periodicity were also studied using the inverse wavelet transform. We found that for the SFI the most active flare cycles over the record were Cycles 17, 19, and 21, while Cycles 20, 22, 23, and 24 were the weakest ones with Cycle 18 was intermediate in flare activity. This shows several differences to the equivalent relationships for solar activity implied by sunspot number records. Furthermore, this confirms that solar activity trends and variability in the chromosphere as captured by SFI are not necessarily the same as those of the Sun’s photosphere, as implied by the sunspot number activity records, for instance. We have also introduced a new signal/noise wavelet coherence metric to analyze two different chromospheric indices available (i.e. the SFI and the disk-integrated chromospheric Ca ii K activity indices) and to quantify the differences and similarities of the oscillations within the solar chromosphere. Our findings suggest the importance of carrying out additional co-analyses with other solar activity records to find physical inter-relations and connections between the different solar layers from the photosphere, the chromosphere to the corona. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","<b>Tool wear and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction based on reduced feature set and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization<\/b><br><br>Accurate prediction of machine tool wear is an essential part of modern and efficient manufacturing. In recent years, many studies have been carried out using machine learning algorithms, both traditional and deep learning; with the latter ones reporting the highest precisions. The present work aims to show that, in the tool wear prediction problem, traditional methods can have a performance similar to the state of the art, obtained using deep learning methods. The data used here is presented in the form of time series, which cannot be used directly by traditional machine learning algorithms, such as the ones used in this work. To link the raw data and the learning algorithm, it is first necessary to extract a set of features from the time series. In addition, some preprocessing techniques, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization and forward feature selection are applied. In this work, two freely accessible databases are used with two different but related objectives, the first is used to predict machine tool wear, while the second is used to predict the remaining useful life of machine tools. For the first case, errors (RMSE) of less than 10 were obtained, while in the second case scores above 85% were achieved. In both cases, these results are comparable to the state of the art. Using the methodology presented here makes it possible to obtain very accurate tool wear predictions at a lower computational cost, both due to the use of less complex models and to a reduced set of features. © 2021, German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP).","<b>Quantifying the effect of human population mobility on malaria risk in the Peruvian Amazon<\/b><br><br>The impact of human population movement (HPM) on the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, has been described. However, there are limited data on the use of new technologies for the study of HPM in endemic areas with difficult access such as the Amazon. In this study conducted in rural Peruvian Amazon, we used self-reported travel surveys and GPS trackers coupled with a Bayesian spatial model to quantify the role of HPM on malaria risk. By using a densely sampled population cohort, this study highlighted the elevated malaria transmission in a riverine community of the Peruvian Amazon. We also found that the high connectivity between Amazon communities for reasons such as work, trading or family plausibly sustains such transmission levels. Finally, by using multiple human mobility metrics including GPS trackers, and adapted causal inference methods we identified for the first time the effect of human mobility patterns on malaria risk in rural Peruvian Amazon. This study provides evidence of the causal effect of HPM on malaria that may help to adapt current malaria control programmes in the Amazon. © 2022 The Authors.","<b>Potential Current and Future Distribution of the Long-Whiskered Owlet (Xenoglaux loweryi) in Amazonas and San Martin, NW Peru<\/b><br><br>The IUCN has listed the long-whiskered owlet (Xenoglaux loweryi) as vulnerable due to the presence of few geographic records, its restricted range, and anthropogenic threats. Its natural history and ecology are largely unknown, and its distribution is widely debated; therefore, there is an urgent need for the real-time conservation of X. loweryi. In this study, 66 geo-referenced records of X. loweryi, 18 environmental variables, and the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) have been used to predict the current and future (2050 and 2070) potential distribution of X. loweryi in the Amazonas and San Martin regions of northwestern Peru. In fact, under current conditions, areas of “high”, “moderate”, and “low” potential habitat suitability cover 0.16% (140.85 km2), 0.46% (416.88 km2), and 1.16% (1048.79 km2) of the study area, respectively. Moreover, under future conditions, the “high”, “moderate”, and “low” probability areas present profits and losses in terms of habitat suitability. Based on the environmental variables, this species mostly inhabits areas with a forest fraction with presence of trees with an emergent tree canopy of ~10–30 metres and depends on Yunga montane forest habitats with high humidity but it is not dependent on bare cover area, crops, or grasslands. Nevertheless, most of the current and future distribution areas are not part of the protected natural areas of Amazonas and San Martin. Additionally, the combination of climate change and anthropogenic activities contribute to further losses of this species habitat. Therefore, from the management point of view, corrective and preventive actions will help to preserve this species over time. © 2022 by the authors.","<b>Ambient noise tomography of Misti volcano, Peru<\/b><br><br>To better understand the recent internal structure of Misti volcano, we determined a 3D S-wave velocity model applying Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT). We used data from 23 broadband and short-period seismic stations temporarily installed at Misti volcano between March and December 2011. This dataset allowed us to obtain empirical Green's functions by cross-correlating seismic ambient noise signals. Then, we retrieved 104 dispersion curves using the frequency-time analysis (FTAN) and, through a non-linear multiscale inversion, we obtained nine 2-D Rayleigh waves group velocity maps for periods in the range 0.7 s - 2 s. Finally, we carried out the depth inversion through a Bayesian transdimensional inversion to obtain a 3-D S-wave velocity model down to 3 km depth. Our study highlights five relevant seismic velocity anomalies. We observed the presence of three high-velocity zones located in the west-northwest, southwest and southeast parts of the crater, that could be related to intrusive bodies possibly associated with the formation of Misti volcano. We also observed two low-velocity anomalies in the volcano's western and central parts, which coincide with previous studies' findings and are related to fractured and weakened materials associated with the external caldera collapse and recent eruption episodes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Tropical and subtropical Asia's valued tree species under threat<\/b><br><br>Tree diversity in Asia's tropical and subtropical forests is central to nature-based solutions. Species vulnerability to multiple threats, which affect provision of ecosystem services, is poorly understood. We conducted a region-wide, spatially explicit assessment of the vulnerability of 63 socioeconomically important tree species to overexploitation, fire, overgrazing, habitat conversion, and climate change. Trees were selected for assessment from national priority lists, and selections were validated by an expert network representing 20 countries. We used Maxent suitability modeling to predict species distribution ranges, freely accessible spatial data sets to map threat exposures, and functional traits to estimate threat sensitivities. Species-specific vulnerability maps were created as the product of exposure maps and sensitivity estimates. Based on vulnerability to current threats and climate change, we identified priority areas for conservation and restoration. Overall, 74% of the most important areas for conservation of these trees fell outside protected areas, and all species were severely threatened across an average of 47% of their native ranges. The most imminent threats were overexploitation and habitat conversion; populations were severely threatened by these factors in an average of 24% and 16% of their ranges, respectively. Our model predicted limited overall climate change impacts, although some study species were likely to lose over 15% of their habitat by 2050 due to climate change. We pinpointed specific natural areas in Borneo rain forests as hotspots for in situ conservation of forest genetic resources, more than 82% of which fell outside designated protected areas. We also identified degraded areas in Western Ghats, Indochina dry forests, and Sumatran rain forests as hotspots for restoration, where planting or assisted natural regeneration will help conserve these species, and croplands in southern India and Thailand as potentially important agroforestry options. Our results highlight the need for regionally coordinated action for effective conservation and restoration. © 2021 The Authors.

However, these models can be severely affected by outlying observations that the beta distribution does not handle well. A robust alternative to the modeling with the beta distribution is considering the rectangular beta (RB) distribution, which is an extension of the former one. The RB distribution can deal with heavy tails and is therefore more flexible than the beta distribution. Regression modeling where covariates are measured with error is a frequent issue in different areas. This paper derives robust regression modeling for proportions with errors-in-variables using the RB distribution under a new parametrization recently proposed in the literature. We use a Bayesian approach to estimate the model parameters with a specification of prior distributions and a computational implementation carried out via the Gibbs sampling. Monte Carlo simulations allow us to conduct numerical evaluation to detect the statistical performance of the approach considered. Then, an illustration with real-world data is presented to show its potential uses. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","<b>The inclusion of Bayes factor and the conversion of effect size in anesthesiology and reanimation research<\/b><br><br>empty","<b>Distribution and conservation status of the mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque) in Peru<\/b><br><br>The mountain tapir Tapirus pinchaque is one of the largest and most threatened mammals of the northern South American Andes. It is distributed in montane forests and paramos mainly above 2000 m, from Colombia to north Peru. The species is categorised as globally Endangered and is mainly threatened by habitat degradation, habitat loss and fragmentation. Although up-to-date information is lacking in Peru on its distribution, population and conservation status, this population could play an important part in the global persistence of the species. We compiled all known recent occurrence records for the species from Peru, as well as data from camera traps with an effort of over 10,000 camera/days between 2016 and 2018. We modelled the tapir's distribution using remote-sensed vegetation indices, topographic and bioclimatic variables in MaxEnt, followed by post-processing steps to remove unoccupied areas, to produce a current range map for the species in Peru. We overlaid this with spatial information on threats and protected areas. We estimate a range of almost 183,000 ha in Peru, in two main regions, north and south of the Huancabamba river, of which approximately 60% is within protected areas. However, protection gaps still exist, especially in the south of its range. Mining concessions cover 27% of its current range and we estimate 28,000 ha of forest loss within its extent of occurrence between 2001 and 2020. We provide recommendations for its conservation, including priority areas for increased protection, binational initiatives to ensure connectivity with populations in Ecuador and to use the tapir as a flagship species in efforts to protect montane ecosystems for water conservation. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH","<b>How likely are clinical events?

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, prospective, and analytical predictive study was conducted in 240 students of a public institute of higher technological education in Ica, Peru during the months of February to May 2018. The SFAI of 10 closed questions and the Helkimo Index modified by Maglione (gold standard) were used as instruments to diagnose TMDs. For the analysis of concordance between both instruments, Cohen's Kappa Index was applied. To evaluate the association according to gender and age group, Pearson's chi-square test was used. For validity of the SFAI in relation to accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were calculated, and they were verified by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) to determine the best cutoff points (area under the curve [AUC]) considering a P value 0.05. Regarding the predictability of the SFAI, the positive and negative predictive value was calculated by applying Bayes' theorem. Results: The SFAI was highly significantly associated with the modified Helkimo Index according to gender (P 0.001), age group (P 0.001), and overall (P 0.001) moderate overall agreement (k = 0.416; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.287-0.545); better concordance was obtained in individuals older than 20 years (k = 0.490, CI = 0.302-0.679) and women (k = 0.565, CI = 0.371-0.759). The ROC curve analysis of the SFAI showed good accuracy (0.852, CI = 0.800-0.905) and was highly significant (P 0.001), with an optimal cutoff point of 17.5 and good sensitivity (80.10%) and specificity (74.36%). In addition, a very good positive predictive value (PPV) (94.15%) and a fair negative predictive value (NPV) (42.02%) were obtained. Conclusions: Although there was moderate concordance between the SFAI and the modified Helkimo Index for the diagnosis of TMDs, the SFAI obtained good accuracy in the overall analysis of sensitivity and specificity. In addition, it demonstrated a high predictive efficacy for detecting positive TMD cases, whereas its ability to rule out positive cases was fair. © 2022 Journal of International Society of Preventive and Community Dentistry | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","<b>Molecular Phylogenetics and Comparative Examination of Voucher Museums Reveal Two New Species of Gymnophthalmid Lizards (Squamata, Gymnophthalmidae) from the Peruvian Andes, with Comments on Proctoporus guentheri (Boettger, 1891)<\/b><br><br>The genus Proctoporus comprises cursorial and semifossorial lizards that inhabit the Andes of Argentina, Bolivia, and Peru. The taxonomy is complex, and many undescribed species and geographic gaps remain to be addressed. In this study, we use molecular phylogenetics and examine voucher museums to describe two new species of gymnophthalmid lizards from the montane forests of Cusco, on the eastern slopes of the Andes of Peru. We inferred phylogenetic relationships from concatenated sequences of four mitochondrial (12S, 16S, ND4, and Cytb) and one nuclear (c-mos) gene fragments, using a Maximum Likelihood approach and Bayesian Inference. We also examined and compared meristic traits of the specimens deposited in herpetological collections in Peru and Bolivia. Our molecular phylogeny had strong support for the monophyly of the subfamily Cercosaurinae, low support for the genus Proctoporus, and revealed two new taxa of Proctoporus. The two new species, which we name P. katerynae sp. nov. and P. optimus sp. nov., are characterized as having two rows of pregular scales and three anterior infralabials. Furthermore, we re-identified specimens assigned to P. laudahnae as P. guentheri, and we comment on the taxonomy of P. guentheri.

The main empirical results are: (i) the VAR coefficients and volatilities change more gradually than the contemporaneous coefficients over time; (ii) the volatility of MP shocks was higher under the pre-Inflation Targeting (IT) regime; (iii) a surprise increase in the interest rate produces gross domestic product (GDP) growth falls and reduces inflation in the long run; (iv) the interest rate reacts more quickly to aggregate supply shocks than to aggregate demand shocks; (v) MP shocks explain a high percentage of domestic variables behavior under the pre-IT regime but their contribution decreases under the IT regime. Overall, these results show that MP has contributed in Peru to lower macroeconomic volatility by (i) reducing average long-term inflation, (ii) increasing the response of GDP growth rate to interest rate, and (iii) by becoming more predictable.

However, there is still no consensus on the causes of their demise. Here, we use the fossil record and Bayesian diversification models to infer the origination and extinction rates for Sparassodonta. Then, we evaluate if their demise can be attributed to global temperature changes, Andean uplift, biotic interactions with their competitor and prey clades, and body mass evolution. That is biotic aspects in the context of the Red Queen model, abiotic aspects in the context of the Court Jester model, and an intrinsic lineage attribute. Our results show that this lineage is characterized by a positive near-zero net diversification rate indicating that the clade maintained a relatively low but stable diversity until the Middle Miocene when an increase in extinction rate drove them to decline and eventual extinction. Moreover, our results support the idea that a drastic regional landscape change triggered by the Andean uplift process affected their diversification dynamics, eventually driving them to extinction. These environmental changes could explicitly affect Sparassodonta lineages due to their ever-present vulnerability to extinction by near-zero net diversification rate and their highly specialized ecology that could have constrained adaptation to new South American landscapes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Reply to “Decibans: it is time to weight the evidence about diagnostic accuracy”<\/b><br><br>empty","<b>Taxonomic status and phylogenetic position of Oxymycterus juliacae Allen 1900 (Rodentia: Cricetidae)<\/b><br><br>The phylogenetic position of the \"Upper yungas inca hocicudo\"Oxymycterus juliacae, one of the lesser-known species of the genus Oxymycterus, is still unresolved. Several authors considered it a subspecies or synonym of Oxymycterus inca, but more recently, it was recognized as a valid species based on morphometric analysis and morphological traits. The objectives of this study were then to substantiate the morphological distinction of O. juliacae and evaluate its phylogenetic position using cytochrome b sequences. We evaluated the morphology of O. juliacae and compared it with congeneric species. In addition, a Cytochrome b gene matrix was subjected to analyses of maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Our results support the morphometric and morphological distinction of O. juliacae and found that this species is more closely related to Oxymycterus willkaurco than to O. inca. Therefore, the recognition of O. juliacae as a full species is supported and a rediagnosis is provided. In addition, we found O. inca is more related to other lowland species from Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, than to central Andean species. More efforts are needed to secure genetic material of Oxymycterus species, mainly the Andean species, for a better understanding of their phylogenetic relationship. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","<b>Inclusive use of effect size conversion and Bayes factor in intensive care medicine research<\/b><br><br>empty","<b>The effects of corruption on growth, human development and natural resources sector: empirical evidence from a Bayesian panel VAR for Latin American and Nordic countries<\/b><br><br>Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effects of corruption on economic growth, human development and natural resources in Latin American and Nordic countries. Design/methodology/approach: Using the hierarchical prior of Gelman et al. (2003), a Bayesian panel Vector AutoRegression (VAR) model is estimated. In addition, two alternative approaches are considered, namely, a panel error correction VAR model and an asymmetric panel VAR model. Findings: The results reveal some relevant contrasts: (1) in Latin America there is support for the sand the wheels hypothesis in Bolivia and Chile, support for the grease the wheels hypothesis in Colombia and no significant impact of corruption on growth in Brazil and Peru, while in Nordic countries the response of growth to shocks in corruption is negative in all cases; (2) corruption negatively affects human development in all countries from both regions; (3) corruption tends to spur natural resources sector in Latin American countries, while it is detrimental for natural resources sector in Nordic countries. Research limitations/implications: The panel VAR approach uses recursive scheme identification. The authors have analyzed robustness using alternative ordering of the variables. The authors also have followed two alternatives suggested by the Referee: a panel error correction VAR model and a panel asymmetric VAR model. However, another more sophisticated identification scheme could be used. Also other variables could be introduced in the VAR model. Practical implications: Regardless of the issue of the “grease” vs the “sand the wheels” debate, corruption should be reduced because it is anyway harmful for human development. The differences in the results for Latin American and Nordic countries show that the effects of corruption have to be assessed considering the different institutional and economic conditions of the countries analyzed. Social implications: Governments should seek to reduce corruption because, despite corruption can have mixed effects on economic growth in some contexts, it is anyway harmful for human development. Besides, the finding that in some Latin American countries more activity in the extractive industries is generated by means of corruption confirm the association between corruption and extractivism found by Gudynas (2017) and can explain why there are issues of environmental damage and social conflict linked to natural resources in those countries. Originality/value: The present study contributes to the literature by presenting evidence on the effects of corruption on growth, human development and natural resources sector in Latin American and Nordic countries. It is the first study on economics of corruption which directly compares Latin American and Nordic countries. This is relevant because there are important differences between both regions since Latin American countries tend to suffer from widespread corruption, while the Nordic ones have a high level of transparency. It is also the first in using a Bayesian panel VAR approach in order to evaluate the effects of corruption. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","<b>Flexible cloglog links for binomial regression models as an alternative for imbalanced medical data<\/b><br><br>The complementary log-log link was originally introduced in 1922 to R. A. Fisher, long before the logit and probit links. While the last two links are symmetric, the complementary log-log link is an asymmetrical link without a parameter associated with it. Several asymmetrical links with an extra parameter were proposed in the literature over last few years to deal with imbalanced data in binomial regression (when one of the classes is much smaller than the other); however, these do not necessarily have the cloglog link as a special case, with the exception of the link based on the generalized extreme value distribution. In this paper, we introduce flexible cloglog links for modeling binomial regression models that include an extra parameter associated with the link that explains some unbalancing for binomial outcomes. For all cases, the cloglog is a special case or the reciprocal version loglog link is obtained. A Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo inference approach is developed. Simulations study to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm is conducted and prior sensitivity analysis for the extra parameter shows that a uniform prior is the most convenient for all models. Additionally, two applications in medical data (age at menarche and pulmonary infection) illustrate the advantages of the proposed models. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","<b>Identification of Language Using ML Algorithms and Vectorization Techniques<\/b><br><br>Tongue classification is a method for identifying and classifying the vernacular employed in a speech or material.

The use of bounded response variables is also very common when there are data containing percentages, rates, or proportions. In this work, with the generalized Gompertz distribution as the baseline distribution, we derive two new two-parameter distributions with bounded support, and new quantile parametric mixed regression models are proposed based on these distributions, which consider bounded response variables with heavy tails. Estimation of the parameters using the Bayesian approach is considered for both models, relying on the No-U-Turn sampler algorithm. The inferential methods can be implemented and then easily used for data analysis. Simulation studies with different quantiles (q= 0.1 , q= 0.5 and q= 0.9) and sample sizes (n= 100 , n= 200 , n= 500 , n= 2000 , n= 5000) were conducted for 100 replicas of simulated data for each combination of settings, in the (0, 1) and [0, 1), showing the good performance of the recovery of parameters for the proposed inferential methods and models, which were compared to Beta Rectangular and Kumaraswamy regression models. Furthermore, a dataset on extreme poverty is analyzed using the proposed regression models with fixed and mixed effects.

This has led countries such as China, Switzerland and Australia to carry out studies using Bayesian networks to determine the main causes and, based on them, propose measures to reduce the number of traffic accidents. Following this trend, we, without having any expert knowledge on the subject, decided to analyze the data of traffic accidents on the Pan-American Highway in Lima, Peru. This analysis was done by means of directed graph learning with the Hill Climbing Search, Chow-Liu, K2, BIC and BDEU. In addition, we used a Bayesian estimator to calculate the conditional probability distribution for our dataset. This dataset contains observations from the years 2017 to 2019 and approximately 16 km of this highway. Our results show that it is possible to identify the possible causes of excess accidents in specific areas of the Pan-American Highway in certain shifts i.e., 32% of fatal accidents occur between 12 am and 7 pm in the Rimac district and of these 20% are due to pedestrians on the highway.

Despite the poverty in Peru has declined in the last decades, there is still poor districts in risk to become extremely poor, even in its capital, Lima. In this context, it is relevant to study the incidence of extreme poverty at district levels. In this paper, we propose to estimate the quantiles of the incidence of extreme poverty of districts in Lima by using spatial quantile models based on the Kumaraswamy distribution and spatial random effects for areal data. Furthermore, in order to deal with spatial confounding random effects we used the Spatial Orthogonal Centroid “K”orrection approach. Bayesian inference for these hierarchical models is conveniently performed based on the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method.

Since human emotions can be expressed in different ways (e.g., face, gesture, voice), multimodal approaches are useful to support the recognition process. However, although there exist studies dealing with multimodal emotion recognition for social robots, they still present limitations in the fusion process, dropping their performance if one or more modalities are not present or if modalities have different qualities. This is a common situation in social robotics, due to the high variety of the sensory capacities of robots; hence, more flexible multimodal models are needed. In this context, we propose an adaptive and flexible emotion recognition architecture able to work with multiple sources and modalities of information and manage different levels of data quality and missing data, to lead robots to better understand the mood of people in a given environment and accordingly adapt their behaviour. Each modality is analyzed independently to then aggregate the partial results with a previous proposed fusion method, called EmbraceNet+, which is adapted and integrated to our proposed framework. We also present an extensive review of state-of-the-art studies dealing with fusion methods for multimodal emotion recognition approaches. We evaluate the performance of our proposed architecture by performing different tests in which several modalities are combined to classify emotions using four categories (i.e., happiness, neutral, sadness, and anger). Results reveal that our approach is able to adapt to the quality and presence of modalities. Furthermore, results obtained are validated and compared with other similar proposals, obtaining competitive performance with state-of-the-art models. © 2013 IEEE.","<b>Integrative taxonomy clarifies species limits in the hitherto monotypic passion-vine butterfly genera Agraulis and Dryas (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae, Heliconiinae)<\/b><br><br>The Heliconiini genera Agraulis and Dryas are widely distributed throughout the Neotropics and into adjacent temperate regions, and although they are currently treated as monotypic, both show significant geographic phenotypic variation. In this work, we employ six genetic markers (4199 bp), two mitochondrial and four nuclear, to perform coalescent species delimitation analyses in Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BPP) and in integrated BPP (iBPP), the latter also includes linear measurements and wings landmarks. We also analyze cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) barcode sequences for each genus using genetic distances, haplotype networks and a character-based approach. Based on the model testing results, complemented with data from previous studies, we performed morphometric analyses to compare fore and hindwing size, aspect ratio and shape among the new species. In addition, we compared the forewing spot pattern of hypothesizes species using the r package patternize and, for Dryas, compared the colour patterns of mature larvae. Model testing of the molecular species delimitation outputs favoured a seven species hypothesis for Agraulis and a four species hypothesis for Dryas. Average distances among COI barcode sequences of these groups were from 1.09 to 5.81% in Agraulis and from 1.09 to 3.44% in Dryas. Within-group distances ranged from 0 to 1.11% and between 0 and 2.43%, respectively. NeighborNet haplotype networks showed that all but one of the species are monophyletic, and the character-based approach found exclusive diagnostic positions for most species, while the rest can be recognized by unique combinations of the 44 informative nucleotide positions analysed. Morphometric analysis supported all species of Agraulis and Dryas based on wing shape, and also in several cases on wing sizes and aspect ratio (hindwing length–forewing length), including A. v. galapagensis, which was absent from the molecular study. The analysis of the forewing spot pattern also revealed differences among most species hypothesis. The colour pattern of the last instar larva is also diagnostic for each Dryas species hypothesis. Locality data for species in both genera show that most of them are allopatric albeit a few have contact zones being parapatric at some locations. Based on the observed genetic differences, which covary with morphology and geographical distribution, we recommend the recognition of eight species of Agraulis: A. incarnata, A. vanillae, A. forbesi new status, A. insularis reinstated status, A. maculosa new status, A. lucina reinstated status, A. galapagensis new status and one undescribed species, and four species of Dryas: D. iulia, D. dominicana revised status, D. lucia revised status and D. alcionea reinstated status. Further work is needed to investigate, which selective forces have led to the current configurations of venation and wing shape, the probable gene flow among species with a focus on Agraulis and gather more data on species ecology.

We tested the machine learning algorithm Maxent to predict deforestation across the Peruvian Amazon. We used official annual 2001-2019 deforestation data to develop a predictive model and to test the model's accuracy using near-real-time forest loss data for 2020. Distance from agricultural land and distance from roads were the predictor variables that contributed most to the final model, indicating that a narrower set of variables contribute nearly 80% of the information necessary for prediction at scale. The permutation importance indicating variable information not present in the other variables was also highest for distance from agricultural land and distance from roads, at 40.5% and 14.3%, respectively. The predictive model registered 73.2% of the 2020 early alerts in a high or very high risk category; less than 1% of forest cover in national protected areas were registered as very high risk, but buffer zones were far more vulnerable, with 15% of forest cover being in this category.

With an integrative taxonomic view, we described their taxonomic status, morphological characters, productive parameters, and phylogenetic position. In the case of both strains, the relationship between biometrics and productive parameters obtained with Principal Components Analysis indicated that the lorica length was associated with longevity, progeny, egg production, and reproductive age, while the lorica width and aperture were associated with the maximum number of eggs carried. Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference analysis carried out with mtDNA COI gene and rDNA ITS1 region showed that both strains were clustered in two clades with distinct phylogenetic positioning from what is currently known for Brachionus plicatilis s.l. One of the strains, Z010-VL, is proposed to be a subspecies of L4 (B. paranguensis), and the other strain, Z018-SD, is proposed as a sub species of SM2 (B. koreanus). In addition, 33 and 31 aquaculture production lineages are proposed, delimited by COI and concatenated COI+ITS1 sequences, respectively.

To combat against deforestation and landscape change, the Peru government has created Protected Areas (PAs) to maintain floral diversity, conserve forests and environmental services. Along with tremendous anthropogenic pressures, billions of dollars have been spent every year to promote and save the PAs, yet rigorous quantified evaluation and interpretation of such PAs are lacking. Considering such knowledge gap, we have quantified the forest loss under the PAs and their buffer areas over the last 20 years (2001–2019) have been performed using Google Earth Engine. Furthermore, the potential deforestation risk zones were identified using the Maximum Entropy based predictive modelling. Outcome showed that the forest cover losses within the PAs were 114,463 ha and 782,781 ha within the buffer zones in the last 20 years. Additionally, high deforestation risk zones were mainly found in the central and southwestern parts of the Peruvian Amazon and interestingly close to the navigable riverbanks. We have received high prediction accuracy (AUC 0.964) and further validated with high-resolution PlanetScope imageries.

In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods have been considered in the context of genomic prediction. The DL methods are nonparametric models providing flexibility to adapt to complicated associations between data and output with the ability to adapt to very complex patterns. Main body: We review the applications of deep learning (DL) methods in genomic selection (GS) to obtain a meta-picture of GS performance and highlight how these tools can help solve challenging plant breeding problems. We also provide general guidance for the effective use of DL methods including the fundamentals of DL and the requirements for its appropriate use. We discuss the pros and cons of this technique compared to traditional genomic prediction approaches as well as the current trends in DL applications. Conclusions: The main requirement for using DL is the quality and sufficiently large training data. Although, based on current literature GS in plant and animal breeding we did not find clear superiority of DL in terms of prediction power compared to conventional genome based prediction models. Nevertheless, there are clear evidences that DL algorithms capture nonlinear patterns more efficiently than conventional genome based. Deep learning algorithms are able to integrate data from different sources as is usually needed in GS assisted breeding and it shows the ability for improving prediction accuracy for large plant breeding data. It is important to apply DL to large training-testing data sets. © 2021, The Author(s).","<b>Bayesian inference for zero-and/or-one augmented beta rectangular regression models<\/b><br><br>In this paper, we developed a full set of Bayesian inference tools, for zero-and/or-one augmented beta rectangular regression models to analyze limited-augmented data, under a new parameterization.

However, because it is a predictive methodology, GS strongly depends on statistical and machine learning to perform these predictions. For continuous outcomes, more models are available for GS. Unfortunately, for count data outcomes, there are few efficient statistical machine learning models for large datasets or for datasets with fewer observations than independent variables. For this reason, in this paper, we applied the univariate version of the Poisson deep neural network (PDNN) proposed earlier for genomic predictions of count data. The model was implemented with (a) the negative log-likelihood of Poisson distribution as the loss function, (b) the rectified linear activation unit as the activation function in hidden layers, and (c) the exponential activation function in the output layer. The advantage of the PDNN model is that it captures complex patterns in the data by implementing many nonlinear transformations in the hidden layers. Moreover, since it was implemented in Tensorflow as the back-end, and in Keras as the front-end, the model can be applied to moderate and large datasets, which is a significant advantage over previous GS models for count data. The PDNN model was compared with deep learning models with continuous outcomes, conventional generalized Poisson regression models, and conventional Bayesian regression methods. We found that the PDNN model outperformed the Bayesian regression and generalized Poisson regression methods in terms of prediction accuracy, although it was not better than the conventional deep neural network with continuous outcomes. © 2021 The Authors.

In adults, one of the most widely used indicators of skeletal age is the Root Dentin Translucency (RDT), mainly through the Lamendin technique, which is used in various Latin American contexts. Recently, Parra et al. (2020) have developed a Bayesian regression model using the Lamendin technique to establish standardized criteria for estimating age-at-death in adults in various forensic contexts. In this study, we evaluate the applicability of this proposal together with the proposal by Lamendin et al. (1992) and Prince and Ubelaker (2002) in Latin American contexts. A sample of single-rooted teeth belonging to 805 individuals from six Latin American countries was used. The results of the three proposals considered were analyzed taking into account factors such as age, sex, origin, and the tooth surface on which the variables were surveyed. Of the factors that would affect the estimates, it was found that the age of the individuals had the greatest influence. However, it was confirmed that the sex and surface of the teeth on which the measurements were taken did not influence the final result. On the other hand, as we expected, the application of the analyzed proposals would also be possible in other forensic contexts, as shown by the results obtained according to the origin.

In this study, we implemented DNA barcoding analyses in addition to single-gene species delimitation analyses in order to identify molecular operational taxonomy units (MOTUs) and to generate robust molecular information for penaeid shrimp based on the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) mitochondrial gene. Our final data set includes COI sequences from 112 taxa distributed in 23 genera of penaeids. We employed the general mixed Yule coalescent (GMYC) model, the Poisson tree processes (PTP), and the Bayesian PTP model (bPTP) for MOTUs delimitation. Intraspecific and interspecific genetic distances were also calculated. Our findings evidenced a high level of hidden diversity, showing 143 MOTUs, with 27 nominal species not agreeing with the genetic delimitation obtained here. These data represent potential new species or highly structured populations, showing the importance of including a non-distance-based species delimitation approach in biodiversity studies. The results raised by this study shed light on the Penaeidae biodiversity, addressing important issues about taxonomy and mislabeling in databases and contributing to a better comprehension of the group, which can certainly help management policies for shrimp fishery activity in addition to conservation programs. © 2021 by the authors.

This study evaluates the contribution of these sources on Arequipa, Peru through an evaluation of aerosol sulfate δ34S values and water-soluble ions (WSI). The anthropogenic and natural sources of particulate pollution were determined by aerosol filter sampling from four different locations (urban, suburban, industrial, and rural) providing a view of the spatial variability of aerosols within the city. Sulfate (avg. 2.97 μm/m3) is the most abundant ion species in the aerosols sampled contributing on average 20% of the molar mass. Ion composition profiles between sampling sites are very similar indicating common sources and high contributions of mobilized local surface salt to the aerosols in this desert region. The regional atmospheric chemistry model (RACM) 0-D run for the area confirms that emissions from fuel combustion sources alone cannot account for the high concentrations of sulfate observed. A combination of the RACM results, WSI data, and a Bayesian δ34S isotope mixing model determined that the majority of aerosol sulfates in the area are from mineral dust adding to fossil fuel combustion sources. Mineral dust entrainment in the region is likely elevated by the close proximity of open-pit mining and unpaved roads near the city. Marine organic aerosols and smelting located along the Pacific contribute little to Arequipa's aerosol sulfate concentration. While the influence of volcanic sulfate (9% on average) is low, overall natural sulfate (dust, volcanic, and DMS) accounts for 43% of the aerosol sulfate. Therefore, even though the local environment creates high sulfate background levels, a reduction of sulfate aerosol pollution would be possible if fossil fuel emissions were reduced. © 2021 The Author(s)","<b>Predicting approximate seismic responses in multistory buildings from real-time earthquake source information, for earthquake early warning applications<\/b><br><br>Regional earthquake early warning (EEW) alerts and related risk-mitigation actions are often triggered when the expected value of a ground-motion intensity measure (IM), computed from real-time magnitude and source location estimates, exceeds a predefined critical IM threshold. However, the shaking experienced in mid- to high-rise buildings may be significantly different from that on the ground, which could lead to sub-optimal decision-making (i.e., increased occurrences of false and missed EEW alarms) with the aforementioned strategy. This study facilitates an important advancement in EEW decision-support, by developing empirical models that directly relate earthquake source parameters to resulting approximate responses in multistory buildings. The proposed models can leverage real-time earthquake information provided by a regional EEW system, to provide rapid predictions of structure-specific engineering demand parameters that can be used to more accurately determine whether or not an alert is triggered. We use a simplified continuum building model consisting of a flexural/shear beam combination and vary its parameters to capture a wide range of deformation modes in different building types. We analyse the approximate responses for the building model variations, using Italian accelerometric data and corresponding source parameter information from 54 earthquakes. The resulting empirical prediction equations are incorporated in a real-time Bayesian framework that can be used for building-specific EEW applications, such as (1) early warning of floor-shaking sensed by occupants; and (2) elevator control. Finally, we demonstrate the improvement in EEW alert accuracy that can be achieved using the proposed models. © 2021, The Author(s).","<b>Multi-locus phylogeny with dense Guiana Shield sampling supports new suprageneric classification of the neotropical three-barbeled catfishes (Siluriformes: Heptapteridae)<\/b><br><br>The catfish family Heptapteridae is ubiquitous across a range of freshwater habitats from southern Mexico to northern Argentina and contains 23 genera and 228 valid species. After a century of mostly morphology-based systematic analyses of these fishes, we provide the first molecular phylogenetic hypothesis spanning most valid Heptapteridae genera (16 of 23). We examined eight of 14 valid genera in the Nemuroglanis-subclade (Heptapterini), all valid genera in the Brachyglanis-subclade (Brachyglaniini) and most valid Brachyglaniini species (11 of 15). Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of a 4156-base alignment of five gene regions (three mitochondrial: COI, Cyt b, and ND2; two nuclear: RAG2, Glyt) yielded thoroughly resolved and statistically robust phylogenies that were largely congruent with each other and with previous morphology-based hypotheses. We propose a revised phylogenetic classification consisting of two subfamilies (Rhamdiinae, Heptapterinae) each with two tribes. Dense taxonomic sampling of Brachyglaniini, including type species of Brachyglanis, Gladioglanis, Leptorhamdia, and Myoglanis, revealed widespread paraphyly. Newly recovered clades within Brachyglaniini are closely associated with either the upper Orinoco or the Essequibo suggesting repeated dispersals and/or range expansions/contractions across the western Guiana Shield highlands and from there to the upper Amazon and Brazilian Shield. These biogeographical processes appear to have been an important driver of allopatric diversification in the clade. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Evidence of local adaptation despite strong drift in a Neotropical patchily distributed bromeliad<\/b><br><br>Both genetic drift and divergent selection are predicted to be drivers of population differentiation across patchy habitats, but the extent to which these forces act on natural populations to shape traits is strongly affected by species’ ecological features. In this study, we infer the genomic structure of Pitcairnia lanuginosa, a widespread herbaceous perennial plant with a patchy distribution. We sampled populations in the Brazilian Cerrado and the Central Andean Yungas and discovered and genotyped SNP markers using double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing. In addition, we analyzed ecophysiological traits obtained from a common garden experiment and compared patterns of phenotypic and genetic divergence (PST–FST comparisons) in a subset of populations from the Cerrado. Our results from molecular analyses pointed to extremely low genetic diversity and a remarkable population differentiation, supporting a major role of genetic drift. Approximately 0.3% of genotyped SNPs were flagged as differentiation outliers by at least two distinct methods, and Bayesian generalized linear mixed models revealed a signature of isolation by environment in addition to isolation by distance for high-differentiation outlier SNPs among the Cerrado populations. PST–FST comparisons suggested divergent selection on two ecophysiological traits linked to drought tolerance. We showed that these traits vary among populations, although without any particular macro-spatial pattern, suggesting local adaptation to differences in micro-habitats. Our study shows that selection might be a relevant force, particularly for traits involved in drought stress, even for populations experiencing strong drift, which improves our knowledge on eco-evolutionary processes acting on non-continuously distributed species. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Genetics Society.","<b>THE EFFECT OF MANAGEMENT REGIMES ON MAMMAL OCCUPANCY IN A CONSERVATION CORRIDOR IN THE SOUTHEASTERN PERUVIAN AMAZON<\/b><br><br>Conservation corridors are an interesting strategy considering the increasing forest conversion by agricultural areas. We used Bayesian multispecies occupancy model in order to assess the occupancy of mammal species along the Manu-Tambopata conservation corridor (4 164.06 km2), located in the southern Peruvian Amazon.We installed 102 camera traps between May and October of 2017 (8 104 camera days), in four management regimes: Río Los Amigos conservation concession, forestry concessions (ACOMAT), Tambopata National Reserve and agricultural lands. Twenty-seven species of terrestrial mammals were recorded; however, models did not reveal significant differences in species richness among management regimes, although an effect of edge density on community-level occupancy was evident. Non-significant relationships were found between commonly hunted species and management regimes, apart from the white-lipped peccary; however, short-eared dog (Atelocynus microtis) and jaguar (Panthera onca) occupancy were significantly lower on agricultural lands. Our results suggested that, in general, the management regimes and covariables (edge density and distance to roads) did not have an effect at the community level but did have species-specific effects for some species (e.g., A. microtis). MAT corridor is still a space where it is feasible to maintain healthy populations of mammals, although its long-term viability requires ensuring connectivity at both a functional and structural levels. © SAREM, 2021.","<b>The use of the Bayes factor in urology clinical research<\/b><br><br>empty","<b>An example of a bayes factor false positive finding for clinical research<\/b><br><br>empty","<b>Benefits of the Bayes factor in rheumatology research<\/b><br><br>empty","<b>The use of Bayes factor in clinical cardiology research<\/b><br><br>empty","<b>Age-at-death estimation in adults and verification of a forensic international methodology using single-rooted teeth: An approach for a Peruvian context<\/b><br><br>From a forensic perspective, age-at-death estimation in adults is a constant concern that impacts the development of investigations regarding unidentified dead bodies and the need to identify them. Several procedures for age-at-death estimation in adults have been introduced in Peru, and are used in various fields such as bioarcheology and forensics, but very little is known about the precision and accuracy levels of these procedures. Methods derived from the Lamendin technique, validated and the levels of applicability and confidence of the method, have been widely used in Peru since the year 2000 are known. However, a new estimation system using the Lamendin technique has been developed through a Bayesian model. This model stores the information measured in a Forensic International Dental Database (FIDB), which contains information of several populations and also contributes to assessing the applicability levels of this procedure, resulting in more information that can contribute to strengthen the calculation and the outcome. Results show that the Bayesian model has a homogeneous behavior when it is applied to a Peruvian population, and it shows a better adjustment than previous procedures designed for Peruvian populations. Our research recommends using the Bayesian model for forensic age estimation in this population. Lamendin's technique and its methodological derivatives may contribute to start thinking about the global standardization of the method based on forensic Quality Management criteria, which include –but are not limited to– interlaboratory measurement controls, calibration of measurement sources, and application procedure guides. © 2021 The Authors","<b>Biogeographic distribution of Cedrela spp. Genus in Peru using maxent modeling: A conservation and restoration approach<\/b><br><br>The increasing demand for tropical timber from natural forests has reduced the population sizes of native species such as Cedrela spp. because of their high economic value. To prevent the decline of population sizes of the species, all Cedrela species have been incorporated into Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The study presents information about the modeled distribution of the genus Cedrela in Peru that aims to identify potential habitat distribution of the genus, its availability in areas protected by national service of protected areas, and highlighted some areas because of their conservation relevance and the potential need for restoration. We modeled the distribution of the genus Cedrela in Peru using 947 occurrence records that included 10 species (C. odorata, C. montana, C. fissilis, C. longipetiolulata, C. angustifolia, C. nebulosa, C. kuelapensis, C. saltensis, C. weberbaueri, and C. molinensis). We aim to identify areas environmentally suitable for the occurrence of Cedrela that are legally protected by the National Service of Protected Areas (PAs) and those that are ideal for research and restoration projects. We used various environmental variables (19 bioclimatic variables, 3 topographic factors, 9 edaphic factors, solar radiation, and relative humidity) and the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) to predict the probability of occurrence. We observed that 6.7% (86,916.2 km2) of Peru presents a high distribution probability of occurrence of Cedrela, distributed in 17 departments, with 4.4% (10,171.03 km2) of the area protected by PAs mainly under the category of protection forests. Another 11.65% (21,345.16 km2) of distribution covers areas highly prone to degradation, distributed mainly in the departments Ucayali, Loreto, and Madre de Dios, and needs immediate attention for its protection and restoration. We believe that the study will contribute significantly to conserve Cedrela and other endangered species, as well as to promote the sustainable use and management of timber species as a whole. © 2021 by the authors.

While this information is crucial for informing management, information is lacking for many ecologically important species, including apex predators. In this study we examine patterns of genetic structure in the broadnose sevengill shark, Notorynchus cepedianus across its global distribution. We estimate patterns of connectivity among broadnose sevengill shark populations from three major oceanic regions (South Atlantic, Oceania and Eastern Pacific) by contrasting mitochondrial and nuclear DNA haplotype frequencies. We also produced time calibrated Bayesian Inference phylogenetic reconstructions to analyses global phylogeographic patterns and estimate divergence times among distinctive shark lineages. Our results demonstrate significant genetic differentiation among oceanic regions (ΦST = 0.9789, P < 0.0001) and a lack of genetic structuring within regions (ΦST = − 0.007; P = 0.479). Time calibrated Bayesian Inference phylogenetic reconstructions indicate that the observed patterns of genetic structure among oceanic regions are historical, with regional populations estimated to have diverged from a common ancestor during the early to mid-Pleistocene. Our results indicate significant genetic structuring and a lack of gene flow among broadnose sevengill shark populations from the South Atlantic, Oceania and Eastern Pacific regions. Evidence of deep lineage divergences coinciding with the early to mid-Pleistocene suggests historical glacial cycling has contributed to the vicariant divergence of broadnose sevengill shark populations from different ocean basins. These finding will help inform global management of broadnose sevengill shark populations, and provides new insights into historical and contemporary evolutionary processes shaping populations of this ecologically important apex predator. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>The number of species of degus (genus Octodon) is currently underestimated: An appraisal of species limits and their phylogenetic relationships (Rodentia: Hystricomorpha: Octodontidae)<\/b><br><br>As currently understood, the genus Octodon contains five species degus, lunatus, bridgesii, pacificus, and ricardojeda. Previous phylogenetic studies suggest that genus specific diversity is underestimated. In order to evaluate the taxonomic diversity of Octodon, we implemented unilocus (cytochrome-b) and multilocus (cytochrome-b + 4 nuclear genes) species delimitation methods. Octodon degus was recovered as a sister of the other species of the genus. The unilocus bGMYC and mPTP methods, based on cytochrome-b sequences, delimits 11 and 7 candidate species respectively, and both methods fail to recognize O. pacificus from O. ricardojeda. Results of the multilocus analysis (BPP) vary as a function of the dataset used. When the five genes are used 11 species are delimited, while eight species are delimited when only the nuclear genes are used. Octodon bridgesii is shown as comprising at least two species (one on the Pacific coast and the typical form found on the Andean slopes), while O. ricardojeda may comprise two species (one on the Chilean side of the Andes and the other in Argentina). Likewise, both multilocus matrices recover O. pacificus as a distinct species. This shows that species diversity of Octodon is underestimated. Remarkably, many of the delimited species based on genetic data are morphologically differentiated in cranio-dental characteristics. However, a pair of species has not achieved morphological differentiation, being cryptic species. Finally, the incongruence between mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies suggests that processes such as incomplete lineage sorting and/or introgression have been present during the radiation of the genus. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Bayesian replication: how probable is the null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis<\/b><br><br>empty","<b>The methodological contribution of the Bayes factor beyond the hypotheses of significance in clinical research.<\/b><br><br>empty","<b>Species delimitation of southeast pacific angel sharks (Squatina spp.) reveals hidden diversity through dna barcoding<\/b><br><br>Angel sharks are distributed worldwide in tropical to subtropical waters. Across the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO), two valid species are reported: The Pacific angelshark Squatina californica and the Chilean angelshark Squatina armata; however, there is still uncertainty about their geographic distribution, mainly along the northern Peru coast where the species have been reported to be sympatric. The aim of this study is to describe the genetic differences between the genus Squatina from the EPO, including samples from northern Peru, and using DNA barcoding and three species delimitation models: Poisson tree processes (PTP) model, Bayesian implementation of the PTP (bPTP) model and the general mixed Yule coalescent (GMYC) model. The three approaches summarized 19 nominal Squatina species in 23 consensus Molecular Taxonomic Units (MOTU). Only 16 of them were in accordance with taxonomic identifications. From the EPO, four Squatina MOTUs were identified, one from North America (S. californica USA/Mexico) and three sampled in northern Peru, S. californica Peru, S. armata and Squatina sp.

This study contributes to the management and conservation policies of angel sharks in Peru, suggesting the presence of an undescribed species inhabiting the northern Peruvian coast. The use of molecular approaches, such as DNA barcoding, has the potential to quickly flag undescribed species in poorly studied regions, including the Southeast Pacific, within groups of ecologically and economically important groups like angel sharks. © 2021 by the authors.

Materials and Methods: We extracted DNA from museum specimen osteocrusts and from fecal samples collected from free-ranging individuals. We sequenced the mtDNA cytochrome b gene and the control region from samples collected at 13 different sites and used Bayesian inference and Maximum Likelihood to identify distinct clades. We took measurements of the crania of a subset of these specimens (n = 26) and ran a logistic regression to determine if any of the cranial measurements (n = 22) could predict a specimen's clade. In addition, we examined the pelage patterns of the museum specimens and photographs taken of free-ranging individuals and divided them into pelage types based on coloration of the underbelly. Results: We identified two divergent clades, and two distinct groups with clear geographic boundaries within one of those clades. Two measurements of the zygomatic bone perfectly predicted a given individual's mtDNA clade. We found four distinct pelage patterns in our samples, but these patterns are variable within clades and among individuals within the same population. Conclusion: These analyses indicate that the two recognized subspecies of pygmy marmoset should be elevated to the species level (C. pygmaea and C. niveiventris) based on molecular and cranial differences but not on pelage patterns. We provide evidence on the geographic limits of the two clades and identify regions where additional sampling is required to better define the geographic distribution of the two clades. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","<b>Stochastic Volatility in Mean: Empirical evidence from Latin-American stock markets using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Riemann Manifold HMC methods<\/b><br><br>The Stochastic Volatility in Mean (SVM) model of Koopman and Uspensky (2002) is revisited.

Using 14C dating on stem pieces sequestered within the plant's cushion, which grows larger through time, we obtain ages of 15 ± 15 14C yrs BP and 165 ± 15 14C yrs BP at depths of 15 cm and 29 cm below the cushion's living surface, respectively. Applying a mixed calibration curve with a Bayesian growth model yields calendar age ranges of 1948–1958 CE and 1802–1935 CE for our 14C dates, respectively. Such ages provide sufficiently precise constraints for investigations requiring dating during the last few hundred years when individual 14C dates yield imprecise calendar age ranges. We infer a long-term growth rate of 1.3–3.5 mm yr−1, corroborating published maximum short-term growth rates. Extrapolating our growth model to the A. compacta's core suggests that it began growing as early as 1462–1830 CE. At such age it lived through myriad important geological and historical events, including regional earthquakes, volcanic unrest at Misti, decades to centuries of the Little Ice Age, and a broad transect of Peruvian history possibly beginning during the Inca Empire. A. compacta may provide another important geochronological resource in the arid Central Andes that can be applied to date volcanological, glacial, mass-movement, and archaeological features, especially where dendrochronology and lichenometry are not possible. © 2021","<b>Use of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to estimate the effective reproductive number (RT) in Peru during march – april 2020<\/b><br><br>The understanding of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, is essential to improve evidence-based public health policies.

However, the effect of severe drought and extremely wet conditions on the timing and intensity of dengue epidemics is poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to quantify the non-linear and delayed effects of extreme hydrometeorological hazards on dengue risk by level of urbanisation in Brazil using a spatiotemporal model. Methods: We combined distributed lag non-linear models with a spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical model framework to determine the exposure-lag-response association between the relative risk (RR) of dengue and a drought severity index. We fit the model to monthly dengue case data for the 558 microregions of Brazil between January, 2001, and January, 2019, accounting for unobserved confounding factors, spatial autocorrelation, seasonality, and interannual variability. We assessed the variation in RR by level of urbanisation through an interaction between the drought severity index and urbanisation. We also assessed the effect of hydrometeorological hazards on dengue risk in areas with a high frequency of water supply shortages. Findings: The dataset included 12 895 293 dengue cases reported between 2001 and 2019 in Brazil. Overall, the risk of dengue increased between 0–3 months after extremely wet conditions (maximum RR at 1 month lag 1·56 [95% CI 1·41–1·73]) and 3–5 months after drought conditions (maximum RR at 4 months lag 1·43 [1·22–1·67]). Including a linear interaction between the drought severity index and level of urbanisation improved the model fit and showed the risk of dengue was higher in more rural areas than highly urbanised areas during extremely wet conditions (maximum RR 1·77 [1·32–2·37] at 0 months lag vs maximum RR 1·58 [1·39–1·81] at 2 months lag), but higher in highly urbanised areas than rural areas after extreme drought (maximum RR 1·60 [1·33–1·92] vs 1·15 [1·08–1·22], both at 4 months lag). We also found the dengue risk following extreme drought was higher in areas that had a higher frequency of water supply shortages. Interpretation: Wet conditions and extreme drought can increase the risk of dengue with different delays. The risk associated with extremely wet conditions was higher in more rural areas and the risk associated with extreme drought was exacerbated in highly urbanised areas, which have water shortages and intermittent water supply during droughts. These findings have implications for targeting mosquito control activities in poorly serviced urban areas, not only during the wet and warm season, but also during drought periods.

In particular, several taxonomic changes in butterflies (Papilionoidea) have been made solely on the basis of molecular data without identifying morphological synapomorphies that might have aided in diagnosing taxa from butterfly collections or specimens with no accessible DNA. We here focus on the butterfly genus Pseudodebis Forster, 1964 in the so-called 'Taygetis clade', which is one of the major clades in the diverse Neotropical nymphalid subtribe Euptychiina. We inferred the evolution of a male genitalic character using the most comprehensive molecular phylogeny for the 'Taygetis clade' to date. This approach allowed us to identify a synapomorphy for Pseudodebis Forster, 1964, which can be used to morphologically diagnose this genus and to distinguish it from other genera in the 'Taygetis clade'. In addition, we describe two new species of Pseudodebis, P. nakamurai Nakahara & Willmott, sp. nov. and P. pieti Nakahara & Willmott, sp. nov., recovered as sister species based on molecular data, with an estimated time of divergence of 0.3 Ma (Bayesian confidence interval 0.03-1.61 Ma). Despite the low genetic divergence between these two Pseudodebis species, they can be readily distinguished by wing morphology. Pseudodebis nakamurai, sp. nov. and P. pieti, sp. nov. occur in partial sympatry across an elevational gradient along the western Andes, and the inferred recent speciation event might be related to a shift in elevation and possibly a change in larval hostplant preference. urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:38B4AF76-79E9-4D4D-BF16-FCD8F53A7277. © 2021 CSIRO.","<b>Evolutionary analyses of the major variant surface antigen-encoding genes reveal population structure of Plasmodium falciparum within and between continents<\/b><br><br>Malaria remains a major public health problem in many countries. Unlike influenza and HIV, where diversity in immunodominant surface antigens is understood geographically to inform disease surveillance, relatively little is known about the global population structure of PfEMP1, the major variant surface antigen of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The complexity of the var multigene family that encodes PfEMP1 and that diversifies by recombination, has so far precluded its use in malaria surveillance. Recent studies have demonstrated that cost-effective deep sequencing of the region of var genes encoding the PfEMP1 DBLα domain and subsequent classification of within host sequences at 96% identity to define unique DBLα types, can reveal structure and strain dynamics within countries. However, to date there has not been a comprehensive comparison of these DBLα types between countries. By leveraging a bioinformatic approach (jumping hidden Markov model) designed specifically for the analysis of recombination within var genes and applying it to a dataset of DBLα types from 10 countries, we are able to describe population structure of DBLα types at the global scale. The sensitivity of the approach allows for the comparison of the global dataset to ape samples of Plasmodium Laverania species. Our analyses show that the evolution of the parasite population emerging out of Africa underlies current patterns of DBLα type diversity. Most importantly, we can distinguish geographic population structure within Africa between Gabon and Ghana in West Africa and Uganda in East Africa. Our evolutionary findings have translational implications in the context of globalization. Firstly, DBLα type diversity can provide a simple diagnostic framework for geographic surveillance of the rapidly evolving transmission dynamics of P. falciparum. It can also inform efforts to understand the presence or absence of global, regional and local population immunity to major surface antigen variants. Additionally, we identify a number of highly conserved DBLα types that are present globally that may be of biological significance and warrant further characterization. © 2021 Tonkin-Hill et al.

The studied area was the periglacial zone of the snow-capped, the retreat of this glacier is adduced to the climatic variability in the last years. Two families of plants - the Asteraceae and the Poaceae-were found in the area. In the first family, the existing species are: Senecio sublutescens Cuatrec., Baccharis tricuneata (L.f) Pers., Novenia acaulis Cuatrec., Xenophyllum dactylophyllum, V.A. Funk digitatum Funk., Senecio adenophyllus, and in the second family the species identified was the Calamagrostis ef. In order to evaluate the retreat of the Pastoruri glacier, the ice-covered area in the year 2001 was taken as the base point, and it was evaluated up to April 15, 2017, in which it was noticed that the retreat reached 20.95 %, this calculation was made using historical data from the National Service of Meteorology and Hydrology of Peru (SENAMHI), and the use of MAXENT software and Geographic Information System (GIS). It is concluded that the glaciers in the Cordillera Blanca are important indicators of the climate change; and that after these changes it is begun an altitudinal migration of the autochthonous plant species of the Andes taking up the spaces left by the retreat, and that sometimes these species do not adapt to the changes and disappear.

This behavior can be different depending on the region of the country, giving rise to groups (or clusters) with similar profiles. For this kind of data, we propose a finite mixture of a random effects regression model based on the L-Logistic distribution. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is tailored to obtain posterior distributions of the unknown quantities of interest through a Bayesian approach. To illustrate the proposed method, with emphasis on analysis of clusters, we analyze the proportion of votes for a political party in presidential elections in different municipalities observed over time, and then identify groups according to electoral behavior at different levels of favorable votes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","<b>Principal component analysis for body weight prediction of corriedale ewes from Southern Peru<\/b><br><br>We aimed to verify the relationship between body measurements (BM) and body weight as well as to investigate the prediction of live weight (LW) by using original BM and principal component scores of Corriedale ewes. BM of 100 ewes collected in the Illpa Experimental Centre of the National University of Altiplano in Peru were used. Data were recorded on LW, wither height (WH), rump height (RH), thoracic perimeter (TP), abdominal perimeter (AP), fore-shank length (FSL), fore-shank width (FSW), fore-shank perimeter (FSP), tail width (TW), tail perimeter (TPe), hip width (HW), loin width (LWi), shoulder width (SW), forelimb length (FL) and body length (BL). Pear-son correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to LW and others BM. Additionally, regression equations of LW on BM and on its principal components (PC) were computed. Models were compared by using coefficients of multiple determinations (R2), Akaike information (AIC), Bayesian information (BIC) criteria and root mean squared error (RMSE). Correlations (r) for all BM with LW were positive and significant (r = 0.20-0.78), except for FSW (r = 0.18). The PCA of BM and LW extracted four components explaining 68.7% of the total variance. The prediction LW model by using four PC had the lowest RMSE, AIC and BIC values as well as the highest R2 compared to models with smaller number of PC or based on original measurements.

In order to obtain a robust model, the data was divided into validation and training sets, without overlapping. Using the validation set the model architecture and hyper-parameters were found with Bayesian optimization. Using the optimal configuration the TCN was trained with a test and forecasting window of 15 days ahead. Predictions on available data were made from March 06, 2020 until April 13, 2021, whereas forecasting from April 14 to April 29, 2021. In order to account for uncertainty, the TCN estimated the 5%, 50% and 95% prediction quantiles. Evaluation was made using the MAE, MAD, MSLE, RMSLE and PICP metrics. Results suggested some variations in the data distribution. Test results shown an improvement of 24.241, 0.704 and 0.422 for the MAD, MSLE and RMSLE metrics respectively. Finally, the prediction interval analysis shown an average of 97.886% and 97.778% obtained by the model in the train and test partitions. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>Bayesian estimation of multidimensional polytomous item response theory models with Q-matrices using Stan<\/b><br><br>The Q-matrix is commonly used in diagnostic classification models and has recently been incorporated into the multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) models to add information about the relationship between items and dimensions of the latent trait. The reformulation of the MIRT models with Q-matrix (MIRT-Q) has presented to improve the precision of the parameters of these models and to provide a simple and intuitive method for users to define the item-trait relationship. This paper aims to explore the incorporation of the Q-matrix in the formulation of MIRT models for polytomous item responses. Specifically, we introduce the incorporation of the Q-matrix into two of the polytomous MIRT models most known and used: the multidimensional graded response (MGR) model, hereinafter called MGR-Q, and the multidimensional generalized partial credit (MGPC) model, hereinafter called MGPC-Q. We provide readers the code of the MGR-Q and MGPC-Q models in Stan, a Bayesian estimation software, and we conduct a simulation study in order to evaluate the parameter recovery of the estimation method. To illustrate the use of both models in practice, we fit them to an operational dataset from 2400 individuals on 13 items and demonstrate the estimation of MGR-Q and MGPC-Q using the Stan program. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","<b>Reply to the letter: The evidence of Bayesian A/B testing in the contrast of clinical events by COVID-19<\/b><br><br>empty","<b>The evidence of Bayesian A/B testing in the contrast of clinical events by COVID-19<\/b><br><br>empty","<b>The use of the Bayes factor in clinical research of immunology and allergology<\/b><br><br>empty","<b>Residual Analysis in Rasch Counts Models<\/b><br><br>We develop and discuss residual analysis to evaluate the fit of alternative Rasch counts (RC) item response theory (IRT) models.

The main results indicate that an adverse LS shock: (i) reduces credit and real GDP growth by 372 and 75 basis points in the impact period, respectively; (ii) explains 11.2% of real GDP growth variability on average over the following 20 quarters; and (iii) explained a 180-basis point fall in real GDP growth on average during 2009Q1-2010Q1 in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Additionally, the sensitivity analysis shows that the results are robust to alternative identification schemes with sign restrictions; and that an adverse LS shock has a greater impact on non-primary real GDP growth. © 2021, Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C..

The structural simplicity and lack of distinctive phenotypic variation in this group enable the use of DNA-based species delimitation methods in combination with phylogenies (and morphology when feasible) to establish well-supported boundaries among species. Our study employed a multilocus phylogeny and four DNA-based methods (automated barcode gap discovery [ABGD], statistical parsimony [SPN], generalized mixed Yule coalescent [GMYC], and Bayesian phylogenetics and phylogeography [BPP]) for four molecular markers (acl1, act, rpb2, and tef1) to delimit species of two lineages of Trichoderma. Although incongruence among these methods was observed in our analyses, the genetic distance (ABGD) and coalescence (BPP) methods and the multilocus phylogeny strongly supported and confirmed recognition of 108 and 39 different species in the Harzianum and Longibrachiatum lineages, including three new species associated with cacao farms in northern Peru, namely, T.awajun, sp. nov., T.jaklitschii, sp. nov., and T.peruvianum, sp. nov. Morphological distinctions between the new species and their close relatives are primarily related to growth rates, colony appearance, and size of phialides and conidia. This study confirmed that an integrative approach (DNA-based methods, multilocus phylogeny, and phenotype) is more likely to reliably verify supported species boundaries in Trichoderma. © 2021 The Mycological Society of America.","<b>Genetic diversity and population structure of a peruvian coffea arabica l. Collection<\/b><br><br>Peru is an important producer of specialty coffee beans in the world, however the genetic of their coffee plant populations is unknown. Therefore, the genetic diversity and population structure of a Peruvian germplasm collection of plant coffee was analyzed to ascertain its potential use in plant breeding and conservation. In this work 54 DNA genotypes from 17 Coffea arabica L. and one C. canephora Pierre ex A. Froehner accessions were analyzed by microsatellite and sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers. In the assessment of molecular markers both systems were adequate to perform C. arabica germplasm collection genetic analysis. The obtained genetic diversity estimators were similar to germplasm assessments from other plant breeding programs. In the population structure analysis, the genetic differentiation (GST = 0.6584) and genetic flow (Nm = 0.2594) estimators were high. In analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), total variation was divided 43.05% between accessions and 56.95% within accessions. In the Bayesian analysis with STRUCTURE software using admixed model for K = 2, the C. arabica and C. canephora accessions were separated, while for K = 7, the C. arabica accessions were grouped similarly to what obtained by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) dendrogram. The high genetic differentiation and genetic structuring of the accessions would indicate that the cultivars, from which the accessions were originated, have been preserved over time. The genetic diversity of Peruvian coffee might be the consequence of a long history of introductions of cultivars from different origins. © 2021, Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias, INIA.

P300 classification pipelines based on Riemannian Geometry provide accuracies on par with state-of-the-art pipelines, without having the need for spatial filters, and also possess the ability to be calibrated with little data. In this study, five different P300 detection pipelines are compared, with three of them using Riemannian Geometry as either feature extraction or classification algorithms. The goal of this study is to assess the viability of Riemannian Geometry-based methods in non-optimal environments with sudden background noise changes, rather than maximizing classification accuracy values. For fifteen subjects, the average single-trial accuracy obtained for each pipeline was: 56.06% for Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), 72.13% for Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis (BLDA), 63.56% for Riemannian Minimum Distance to Mean (MDM), 69.22% for Riemannian Tangent Space with Logistic Regression (TS-LogR), and 63.30% for Riemannian Tangent Space with Support Vector Machine (TS-SVM). The results are higher for the pipelines based on BLDA and TS-LogR, suggesting that they could be viable methods for the detection of the P300 component when maximizing the bit rate is needed. For multiple-trial classification, the BLDA pipeline converged faster towards higher average values, closely followed by the TS-LogR pipeline. The two remaining Riemannian methods' accuracy also increases with the number of trials, but towards a lower value compared to the aforementioned ones. Single-stimulus detection metrics revealed that the TS-LogR pipeline can be a viable classification method, as its results are only slightly lower than those obtained with BLDA. P300 waveforms were also analyzed to check for evidence of the component being elicited. Finally, a questionnaire was used to retrieve the most intuitive focusing methods employed by the subjects. © 2001-2011 IEEE.","<b>Root Dentin Translucency and Forensic International Dental Database: Methodology for estimation age-at-death in adults using single-rooted teeth<\/b><br><br>Estimation of the age-at-death in adults is essential when the identification of deceased persons with unknown identity is required in both humanitarian and judicial contexts. However, the methodologies and the results obtained can be questioned. Various efforts have been developed to adjust procedures to specific populations, always seeking the precision and accuracy of the methodologies. It is known that the estimation of the age-at-death in adults coexists with wide margins of error, due to several reasons, including but not limited to statistical problems, the size of the sample or the physiological process of aging. This research focuses on a degenerative indicator of the dentin (Root Dentin Translucency) and its combination with Periodontal Height (PH) following the Lamendin's technique for estimation of the age-at-death in adults. The main objective of this research was to demonstrate the applicability of a Bayesian model based on a Forensic International Dental Database (FIDB) that include Root Translucency Height (RTH) and PH as a method to age-at-death in adults. The conclusion of this research was that the combined both indicators become a generalizable age-at-death in adults model for all human populations, where the Bayesian method would offer optimal results in any population. In this way, those populations that do not have had the possibility of validating a specific procedure, now have the opportunity to apply a valid method for estimating age-at-death in adults to global scope. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Effects of climate and land-use changes on fish catches across lakes at a global scale<\/b><br><br>Globally, our knowledge on lake fisheries is still limited despite their importance to food security and livelihoods. Here we show that fish catches can respond either positively or negatively to climate and land-use changes, by analyzing time-series data (1970–2014) for 31 lakes across five continents. We find that effects of a climate or land-use driver (e.g., air temperature) on lake environment could be relatively consistent in directions, but consequential changes in a lake-environmental factor (e.g., water temperature) could result in either increases or decreases in fish catch in a given lake. A subsequent correlation analysis indicates that reductions in fish catch was less likely to occur in response to potential climate and land-use changes if a lake is located in a region with greater access to clean water. This finding suggests that adequate investments for water-quality protection and water-use efficiency can provide additional benefits to lake fisheries and food security. © 2020, The Author(s).","<b>Fitting non-linear mixed models for the description of bovine lactation curves under grazing in El Mantaro, Junín, Peru<\/b><br><br>Conventionally, lactation curves of confined dairy cattle have been modelled using non-linear, fixed effects models (MNL). The aims of this study were (i) to assess the fit of non-linear mixedmodels(MMNL),usingtheWood(y = β1xβ2e-β3x) and Wilmink (y = β1 + β2e-0.009x+ β3x) functions to analyse lactation curves under grazing and in the context of heteroscedasticity and correlated errors, and (ii) to evaluate the effect of parity and calving season on the curve parameters for both functions. The Wood and the Wilmink functions were fitted, using MNL and MMNL to 600 milk production records corresponding to 42 lactations from 2004 to 2012 from dairy cattle with 1, 2 or >3 calvings in the wet or dry season from the herd in the IVITA-El Mantaro Research Station (Junin, Perú). For both functions, the MMNL outperformed the MNL in terms of residual standard error reduction, increasing of the likelihood, and being able to model random effects and correlations for all the parameters of both functions. The MMNL was also able to model heteroscedasticity by means of a variance function and correlated errors by means of a spatial correlation function. There were not important differences in the fitting of the Wood or Wilmink functions in terms of the residual standard error or the Akaike or bayesian information criteria. Both, parity and calving season did not have significant effects on the curve parameters of the Wood and Wilmink functions. It is concluded that the MMNL is an excellent tool to model lactation curves both at the population- or individual-level. © 2020 Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.

Additionally, rural livelihoods largely depend on short-term migrants traveling across borders via the Amazon’s river networks to work in extractive industries, such as logging. As a result, there is likely considerable spillover across country borders, particularly along the border between Peru and Ecuador. This border region exhibits a steep gradient of transmission intensity, with Peru having a much higher incidence of malaria than Ecuador. In this paper, we integrate 13 years of weekly malaria surveillance data collected at the district level in Peru and the canton level in Ecuador, and leverage hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal regression models to identify the degree to which malaria transmission in Ecuador is influenced by transmission in Peru. We find that increased case incidence in Peruvian districts that border the Ecuadorian Amazon is associated with increased incidence in Ecuador. Our results highlight the importance of coordinated malaria control across borders. © 2020 by the authors.

There is an urgent need for the conservation of spectacled bear at real time. However, the lack of knowledge about the distribution of this species is considered as one of the major limitations for decision-making and sustainable conservation. In this study, 92 geo-referenced records of the spectacled bear, 12 environmental variables and the MaxEnt entropy modelling have been used for predictive modelling for the current and future (2050 and 2070) potential distribution of the spectacled bear in Amazonas, northeastern Peru. The areas of “high”, “moderate” and “low” potential habitat under current conditions cover 1.99% (836.22 km2), 14.46% (6081.88 km2) and 20.73% (8718.98 km2) of the Amazon, respectively. “High” potential habitat will increase under all climate change scenarios, while “moderate” and “low” potential habitat, as well as total habitat, will decrease over the time. The “moderate”, “low” and total potential habitat are distributed mainly in Yunga montane forest, combined grasslands/rangelands and secondary vegetation and Yunga altimontane (rain) forest, while “high” potential habitat is also concentrated in the Jalca. The overall outcome showed that the most of the important habitats of the spectacled bear are not part of the protected natural areas of Amazonas, under current as well as under future scenarios. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the severe loss of forest cover and rapid reduction of the timber species seriously threaten this ecosystem and biodiversity. In this study, we have modeled the distribution of the ten most exploited timber forest species in Amazonas (Peru) to identify priority areas for forest conservation and restoration. Statistical and cartographic protocols were applied with 4454 species records and 26 environmental variables using a Maximum Entropy model (MaxEnt). The result showed that the altitudinal variable was the main regulatory factor that significantly controls the distribution of the species. We found that nine species are distributed below 1000 m above sea level (a.s.l.), except Cedrela montana, which was distributed above 1500 m a.s.l., covering 40.68%. Eight of 10 species can coexist, and the species with the highest percentage of potential restoration area is Cedrela montana (14.57% from Amazonas). However, less than 1.33% of the Amazon has a potential distribution of some species and is protected under some category of conservation. Our study will contribute as a tool for the sustainable management of forests and will provide geographic information to complement forest restoration and conservation plans. © 2020 by the authors.","<b>Simulation of the energy efficiency auction prices via the markov chain monte carlo method<\/b><br><br>Over the years, electricity consumption behavior in Brazil has been analyzed due to financial and social problems. In this context, it is important to simulate energy prices of the energy efficiency auctions in the Brazilian electricitymarket. TheMarkov ChainMonte Carlo (MCMC)method generated simulations; thus, several samples were generated with different sizes. It is possible to say that the larger the sample, the better the approximation to the original data. Then, the Kernel method and the Gaussian mixture model used to estimate the density distribution of energy price, and the MCMC method were crucial in providing approximations of the original data and clearly analyzing its impact. Next, the behavior of the data in each histogram was observed with 500, 1000, 5000 and 10,000 samples, considering only one scenario. The samplewhich best approximates the original data in accordancewith the generated histograms is the 10,000th sample, which consistently follows the behavior of the data. Therefore, this paper presents an approach to generate samples of auction energy prices in the energy efficiency market, using theMCMC method through theMetropolis-Hastings algorithm. The results show that this approach can be used to generate energy price samples. © 2020 by the authors.","<b>Patterns of mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA markers describe historical and contemporary dynamics of the Humboldt squid Dosidicus gigas in the Eastern Pacific Ocean<\/b><br><br>Dosidicus gigas is an economically important species distributed in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Unraveling the genetic population structure of this species is crucial to ensure its fishery sustainability and management. Mitochondrial DNA sequences and nuclear neutral loci are useful to understand how historical and contemporary factors drive the genetic population structure of species. However, most studies investigating genetic structuring of D. gigas from its northern and southern populations rely on patterns identified using mitochondrial genes. The use of both types of DNA markers is especially relevant for marine species with high dispersal capabilities such as D. gigas. Here, we describe the genetic structure of D. gigas using partial sequences of the mitochondrial gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 and nuclear microsatellite loci in populations of the northern hemisphere from the Costa Rica Thermal Dome and off Ecuador; and, of the southern hemisphere from the South Equatorial Current and off Peru. Statistical parsimony network and Bayesian analyses from mitochondrial sequences revealed three historical maternal lineages in both hemispheres, with high levels of genetic differentiation and signatures of population expansion during the late Pleistocene. Use of Discriminant Analysis of Principal Component (DAPC) with microsatellite loci of mature and immature individuals showed the presence of at least two contemporary genetic stocks homogeneously co-distributed in both northern and southern hemispheres, which can be explained by the biological characteristics of D. gigas and the variable oceanographic conditions of the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Overall, our findings indicate that cooperation between countries with intensive fishing will benefit the sustainability of D. gigas. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>The Relative Role of Climate Variation and Control Interventions on Malaria Elimination Efforts in El Oro, Ecuador: A Modeling Study<\/b><br><br>Malaria is a vector-borne disease of significant public health concern. Despite widespread success of many elimination initiatives, elimination efforts in some regions of the world have stalled. Barriers to malaria elimination include climate and land use changes, such as warming temperatures and urbanization, which can alter mosquito habitats. Socioeconomic factors, such as political instability and regional migration, also threaten elimination goals. This is particularly relevant in areas where local elimination has been achieved and consequently surveillance and control efforts are dwindling and are no longer a priority. Understanding how environmental change, impacts malaria elimination has important practical implications for vector control and disease surveillance strategies. It is important to consider climate change when monitoring the threat of malaria resurgence due to socioeconomic influences. However, there is limited assessment of how the combination of climate variation, interventions and socioeconomic pressures influence long-term trends in malaria transmission and elimination efforts. In this study, we used Bayesian hierarchical mixed models and malaria case data for a 29-year period to disentangle the impacts of climate variation and malaria control efforts on malaria risk in the Ecuadorian province of El Oro, which achieved local elimination in 2011. We found shifting patterns of malaria between rural and urban areas, with a relative increase of Plasmodium vivax in urbanized areas. Minimum temperature was an important driver of malaria seasonality and the association between warmer minimum temperatures and malaria incidence was greater for Plasmodium falciparum compared to P. vivax malaria. There was considerable heterogeneity in the impact of three chemical vector control measures on both P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria. We found statistically significant associations between two of the three measures [indoor residual spraying (IRS) and space spraying] and a reduction in malaria incidence, which varied between malaria type. We also found environmental suitability for malaria transmission is increasing in El Oro, which could limit future elimination efforts if malaria is allowed to re-establish. Our findings have important implications for understanding environmental obstacles to malaria elimination and highlights the importance of designing and sustaining elimination efforts in areas that remain vulnerable to resurgence. © Copyright © 2020 Fletcher, Stewart-Ibarra, Sippy, Carrasco-Escobar, Silva, Beltran-Ayala, Ordoñez, Adrian, Sáenz, Drakeley, Jones and Lowe.","<b>Taxonomic status of the Neotropical salamanders Bolitoglossa altamazonica and Bolitoglossa peruviana (Amphibia: Caudata: Plethodontidae), with the description of a new species from Northern Peru<\/b><br><br>We examine the phylogenetic relationships among salamanders of the genus Bolitoglossa (Eladinea) distributed in the Amazonian basin of northern Peru and southern Ecuador and assess species diversity based on morphological and phylogenetic analyses. We infer a molecular phylogeny using sequences from two mitochondrial (Cytb, 16S) and two nuclear genes (RAG-1, POMC). We find two well-supported subclades, one including [B. altamazonica + B. peruviana] + B. awajun sp. n., and the other including Bolitoglossa sp. Ituxi + Bolitoglossa sp. Jurúa. Ecuadorian lineages form divergent clades from the Peruvian lineages. Accordingly, Ecuadorian populations previously assigned to Bolitoglossa peruviana sensu lato are treated as members of a Bolitoglossa equatoriana species complex. A newly defined Bolitoglossa altamazonica species complex contains only populations from the Amazonian rainforest of Peru. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian Inference analyses confirm the phylogenetic placement of B. altamazonica and B. peruviana, and support recognition of a related new species of Bolitoglossa. The uncorrected genetic distances between the new species and B. altamazonica are 6.5% for Cytb and 4.9% for 16S; and the uncorrected genetic distances between the new species and B. peruviana are 8.0% for Cytb and 3.9% for 16S. Additionally, analyses of nuclear gene sequences show no haplotype sharing between the new species and closely related species. The new species is distinguished from its congeners by a combination of the following morphological characters: (1) Standard length mean 37.7 mm in males (range 32.0-42.2; n=5) and 41.4 mm in females (range 34.9-48.2; n=6); (2) in life, dorsal coloration uniformly brown with a dark brown triangular marking between the eyes or some irregular light cream spots or patches on the head, back and flanks; (3) iris pale golden; (4) in preservative, dark brown venter with cream mottlings or moderate-sized blotches on the gular region, belly, cloacal region and tail; (5) tips of third finger and third toe protuberant and pointed with nearly complete webbing on the hands and feet; (6) 11-26 maxillary teeth and 8-24 vomerine teeth. Given that the syntypes of B. altamazonica are lost, we designate a neotype for B. altamazonica from Allpahuayo Mishana National Reserve, Loreto department, Peru. Newly collected specimens from ~30 km NE from Moyobamba (type locality of B. peruviana) provide a better understanding of B. peruviana and enable us to show that it is the sister taxon of B. altamazonica. The new species is known from pre-montane forests in Cordillera Escalera Regional Conservation Area, Cordillera Azul National Park and Shucshuyacu, San Martin department, Peru at 485-1311 m elevation, ~75 km SE from Moyobamba.

Forest plantations can be a restoration strategy, while conserving economically important species affected by climate change and providing forestry material for markets. This study modelled the species distribution under current conditions and climate change scenarios of five Timber Forest Species (TFS) in the Amazonas Department, northeastern Peru. Modelling was conducted with Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) using 26 environmental variables. Of the total distribution under current conditions of Cedrelinga cateniformis, Ceiba pentandra, Apuleia leiocarpa, Cariniana decandra and Cedrela montana, 34.64% (2985.51 km2), 37.96% (2155.86 km2), 35.34% (2132.57 km2), 33.30% (1848.51 km2), and 35.81% (6125.44 km2), respectively, correspond to degraded areas and, therefore, there is restoration potential with these species. By 2050 and 2070, all TFS are projected to change their distribution compared to their current ranges, regardless of whether it will be an expansion and/or a contraction. Consequently, this methodology is intended to guide the economic and ecological success of forest plantations in reducing areas degraded by deforestation or similar activities. © 2020 by the authors.","<b>Vastly underestimated species richness of Amazonian salamanders (Plethodontidae: Bolitoglossa) and implications about plethodontid diversification<\/b><br><br>We present data showing that the number of salamander species in Amazonia is vastly underestimated. We used DNA sequences of up to five genes (3 mitochondrial and 2 nuclear) of 366 specimens, 189 corresponding to 89 non-Amazonian nominal species and 177 Amazonian specimens, including types or topotypes, of eight of the nine recognized species in the region. By including representatives of all known species of Amazonian Bolitoglossa, except for one, and 73% of the currently 132 recognized species of the genus, our dataset represents the broadest sample of Bolitoglossa species, specimens, and geographic localities studied to date. We performed phylogenetic analyses using parsimony with tree-alignment and maximum likelihood (ML) with similarity alignment, with indels as binary characters. Our optimal topologies were used to delimit lineages that we assigned to nominal species and candidate new species following criteria that maximize the consilience of the current species taxonomy, monophyly, gaps in branch lengths, genetic distances, and geographic distribution. We contrasted the results of our species-delimitation protocol with those of Automated Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) and multi-rate Poisson Tree Processes (mPTP). Finally, we inferred the historical biogeography of South American salamanders by dating the trees and using dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA). Our results revealed a clade including almost all Amazonian salamanders, with a topology incompatible with just the currently recognized nine species. Following our species-delimitation criteria, we identified 44 putative species in Amazonia. Both ABGD and mPTP inferred more species than currently recognized, but their numbers (23–49) and limits vary. Our biogeographic analysis suggested a stepping-stone colonization of the Amazonian lowlands from Central America through the Chocó and the Andes, with several late dispersals from Amazonia back into the Andes. These biogeographic events are temporally concordant with an early land bridge between Central and South America (~10–15 MYA) and major landscape changes in Amazonia during the late Miocene and Pliocene, such as the drainage of the Pebas system, the establishment of the Amazon River, and the major orogeny of the northern Andes. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","<b>A new class of regression model for a bounded response with application in the study of the incidence rate of colorectal cancer<\/b><br><br>Response variables in medical sciences are often bounded, e.g. proportions, rates or fractions of incidence of some disease.

To accommodate such responses, we propose a new class of regression models for bounded response by considering a new distribution in the open unit interval which includes a new parameter to make a more flexible distribution. The proposal is to obtain compound power normal distribution as a base distribution with a quantile transformation of another family of distributions with the same support and then is to study some properties of the new family. In addition, the new family is extended to regression models as an alternative to the regression model with a unit interval response.

Bayesian networks are numerical uncertainty techniques that can be used to study this problem. A set of experimental data was obtained: air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, and CO2 concentration at one and three meters above the ground in the growing space. The data set was discretized and used to develop a Bayesian Network model that describes the relationships between the studied variables. The model shows the differences that allow to identify the degree of dependence of the variables, as well as to quantify their inference. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","<b>SNP markers as a successful molecular tool for assessing species identity and geographic origin of trees in the economically important South American legume genus Dipteryx<\/b><br><br>Dipteryx timber has been heavily exploited in South America since 2000s due to the increasing international demand for hardwood. Developing tools for the genetic identification of Dipteryx species and their geographical origin can help to promote legal trading of timber. A collection of 800 individual trees, belonging to 6 different Dipteryx species, was genotyped based on 171 molecular markers. After the exclusion of markers out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or with no polymorphism or low amplification, 83 nuclear, 29 chloroplast, 13 mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and 2 chloroplast and 5 mitochondrial INDELS remained. Six genetic groups were identified using Bayesian Structure analyses of the nuclear SNPs, which corresponded to the different Dipteryx species collected in the field. Seventeen highly informative markers were identified as suitable for species identification and obtained self-assignment success rates to species level of 78-96%. An additional set of 15 molecular markers was selected to determine the different genetic clusters found in Dipteryx odorata and Dipteryx ferrea, obtaining self-assignment success rates of 91-100%. The success to assign samples to the correct country of origin using all or only the informative markers improved when using the nearest neighbor approach (69-92%) compared to the Bayesian approach (33-80%). While nuclear and chloroplast SNPs were more suitable for differentiating the different Dipteryx species, mitochondrial SNPs were ideal for determining the genetic clusters of D. odorata and D. ferrea. These 32 selected SNPs will be invaluable genetic tools for the accurate identification of species and country of origin of Dipteryx timber. © The American Genetic Association 2020.

Despite its great morphological diversity and complex taxonomic history, a robust phylogenetic estimate is still lacking for this group. Here, we study the morphological and molecular diversity of the L. montanus group and present the most complete quantitative phylogenetic hypothesis for the group to date. Our phylogeny includes 103 terminal taxa, of which 91 are members of the L. montanus group (58 are assigned to available species and 33 are of uncertain taxonomic status). Our matrix includes 306 morphological and ecological characters and 3057 molecular characters. Morphological characters include 48 continuous and 258 discrete characters, of which 70% (216) are new to the literature. The molecular characters represent five mitochondrial markers. We performed three analyses: A morphology-only matrix, a molecular-only matrix and a matrix including both morphological and molecular characters (total evidence hypothesis). Our total evidence hypothesis recovered the L. montanus group as monophyletic and included ≥ 12 major clades, revealing an unexpectedly complex phylogeny. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.","<b>Bayesian modeling and prior sensitivity analysis for zero–one augmented beta regression models with an application to psychometric data<\/b><br><br>The interest on the analysis of the zero–one augmented beta regression (ZOABR) model has been increasing over the last few years. In this work, we developed a Bayesian inference for the ZOABR model, providing some contributions, namely: we explored the use of Jeffreys-rule and inde-pendence Jeffreys prior for some of the parameters, performing a sensitivity study of prior choice, comparing the Bayesian estimates with the maximum likelihood ones and measuring the accuracy of the estimates under several scenarios of interest. The results indicate, in a general way, that: the Bayesian approach, under the Jeffreys-rule prior, was as accurate as the ML one. Also, different from other approaches, we use the predictive distribution of the response to implement Bayesian residuals. To further illustrate the advantages of our approach, we conduct an analysis of a real psychometric data set in-cluding a Bayesian residual analysis, where it is shown that misleading inference can be obtained when the data is transformed. That is, when the zeros and ones are transformed to suitable values and the usual beta regression model is considered, instead of the ZOABR model. Finally, future develop-ments are discussed. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2020.","<b>A flexible procedure for formulating probability distributions on the unit interval with applications<\/b><br><br>In this paper, we present a flexible mechanism for constructing probability distributions on a bounded intervals which is based on the composition of the baseline cumulative probability function and the quantile transformation from another cumulative probability distribution.

Additionally, codes with the procedures presented using the Stan package are made available in order to facilitate the use of these models. The work also contains a simulation study that shows how the unbalance in the response variable affects the estimation of the parameters of a logistic regression with respect to the bias, mean square error and standard deviation of the estimates, regardless of the sample size.

New regression models have been proposed in recent years by considering distributions such as the Beta, Simplex and Ku-maraswamy models for this type of data. However, to this type of dataset, it is common to observe the spatial dependence of units. For instance, municipalities or counties are organized into states. For this case, the supposition of independence among observations in the same state removes relevant relations between neighboring provinces. In this paper, we present a model of spatially bounded distribution regression with a Bayesian estimation approach where spatial relations are modeled by a spatial random variable with a particular dependence structure, such as the intrinsic conditional autoregressive model or the Leroux definition. Additionally, the Bayesian inferential method and model comparison criteria are discussed.

In urban settings where vectors are heterogeneously distributed throughout a dense housing matrix, the task of locating infestations can be challenging. Here, we present a novel stochastic compartmental model developed to help locate infested homes in urban areas. We designed the model using infestation data for the Chagas disease vector species Triatoma infestans in Arequipa, Peru. Our approach incorporates disease vector counts at each observed house, and the vector's complex spatial dispersal dynamics. We used a Bayesian method to augment the observed data, estimate the insect population growth and dispersal parameters, and determine posterior infestation probabilities of households. We investigated the properties of the model through simulation studies, followed by field testing in Arequipa. Simulation studies showed the model to be accurate in its estimates of two parameters of interest: the growth rate of a domestic triatomine bug colony and the probability of a triatomine bug successfully invading a new home after dispersing from an infested home. When testing the model in the field, data collection using model estimates was hindered by low household participation rates, which severely limited the algorithm and in turn, the model's predictive power. While future optimization efforts must improve the model's capabilities when household participation is low, our approach is nonetheless an important step toward integrating data with predictive modeling to carry out evidence-based vector surveillance in cities. © 2020 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","<b>Using satellite imagery to estimate heavy vehicle volume for ecological injury analysis in India<\/b><br><br>A major limitation of road injury research in low- and-middle income countries is the lack of consistent data across the settings, such as traffic counts, to measure traffic risk. This study presents a novel method in which traffic volume of heavy vehicles–trucks and buses–is estimated by identifying these vehicles from satellite imagery of Google Earth. For Rajasthan state in India, a total of ∼44,000 such vehicles were manually identified and geo-located on national highways (NHs), with no distinction made between trucks and buses. To estimate population living in proximity to NHs, defined as those living within 1 km buffer of NH, we geocoded ∼45,000 villages and ∼300 cities using Google Maps Geocoding Application Programming Interface (API). We fitted a spatio-temporal Bayesian regression model with the number of road deaths at the district level as the outcome variable. We found a strong Pearson correlation of 0.84 (p < 0.001) between Google Earth estimates of heavy vehicles and freight vehicle counts reported by a national-level study for different road sections. The regression results show that the volume of heavy vehicles and rural population in proximity to highways are positively associated with fatality risk in the districts. These effects have been estimated after controlling for other modes of travel. © 2020 The Author(s).

Although it has been reported in several localities of both versants of the Peruvian Andes, the potential distribution for this species has not been formally analyzed. Therefore, we describe its distributional pattern in the territory and provide comments about the possible influence of the Andes in its distribution. We gathered occurrence records from museums, acoustic surveys, literature, GBIF and Vertnet sources, and we selected localities to minimize spatial correlation. After defining a minimum-convex polygon of Peruvian records as background area, we use Maxent software with bioclimatic variables to construct species distribution models. Several models were evaluated using different metrics, and the model with the lowest AICc was selected. Then, the model was projected for Peruvian territory. Tadarida brasiliensis is reported for the first time in Cajamarca, Piura and Ica departments. The potential distribution model showed two disjunct suitable areas, one for the Pacific versant and other for the Amazonian versant of the Andes, but connected with moderate suitable conditions in the Huancabamba Depression region in northern Perú. Mean diurnal range and annual mean temperature were identified as the main limiting factors for the potential distribution of this species in this territory. Tadarida brasiliensis exhibits a discontinuous distribution in the Peruvian territory. In northern part, the Huancabamba depression zone has climatic conditions that may allow the east-west dispersal for this species. In central and southern parts, the higher crest of the Andes (> 4,500 m) has low suitable conditions due to the extreme climate. In the eastern, the lowland Amazonian forests has low suitability for this species, probably due to high temperatures. We suggest that the Andes could be acting a biogeographical barrier that limits the dispersal for this species, but population-genetic studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. We identified that temperature is the main climatic factor that limit the dispersal of this bat. In conclusion, T. brasiliensis is mainly associated with desert and Andean slopes ecosystems in Perú, and we highlight the importance of incorporating acoustic records in the analysis of its distribution patterns. © 2020 Asociación Mexicana de Mastozoología, www.mastozoologiamexicana.org.","<b>A hierarchical joint model for bounded response time and response accuracy<\/b><br><br>Response time (RT) models traditionally consider positive continuous distributions, for instance, the lognormal, gamma, exponential, and Weibull distributions, with support < 0, ∞ >.

In this study, we described a new species of sand lizard from the coastal lomas of Quilca, La Chira and Ocoña that belongs to the subgenus Eulaemus and group of Liolaemus montanus, all in the province of Camaná, department of Arequipa, Peru. To determine the taxonomic status of this new organism, we analyzed morphological, molecular and geographical characters. The morphological characters allowed the characterization and diagnosis of the new species, the molecular data was used to make a Bayesian inference, and the geographic data served to determine potential distribution areas. This lizard diverges from the other species of the Liolaemus montanus group for its small to medium size, several sets of morphological characters, folidosis and color pattern. It is also the only species of the genus where the males have a pattern of lateral spots of rounded shape with dark border and green interior, from the armpits to the middle of the body. Additionally, the molecular phylogenetic results made with the Cyt-b gene indicate that it has no direct relationship with the phenetically similar species described for the group; nevertheless, there is a relationship with geographically close populations, which has not been properly described.

Such recurring explosive activity represents a significant challenge for regions typically hosting several million people (e.g. Southern Peru, Western Bolivia and Northern Chile). With VEI 6, the 1600 CE Huaynaputina eruption is considered the largest historical eruption in South America. We have re-examined the first Plinian phase of this eruption in order to better assess critical eruption source parameters (i.e. erupted volume, plume height, mass eruption rate, eruption duration).The revised bulk volume of the tephra-fall deposit associated with the Plinian phase is approximately 13–14 km3, almost twice the previous estimate (7–8 km3 within the 1 cm isopach) based on methods including power law, Weibull function and Bayesian linear regression. Tephra was dispersed by strong winds to the WNW as far as 400 km on Peruvian territory and then in the Pacific Ocean. Seven villages were buried, killing ~ 1500 people. The revised plume height estimate, 32.2 ± 2.5 km, is consistent with the early estimations. As a result, the Huaynaputina 1600 CE first eruption phase lies in the upper part of the Plinian field close to the ultra-Plinian transition, making this event one of the largest in the past millennium which coincides with results from recent studies on palaeoclimatic impacts. © 2019, International Association of Volcanology & Chemistry of the Earth's Interior.","<b>Trends in cardiometabolic risk factors in the Americas between 1980 and 2014: A pooled analysis of population-based surveys<\/b><br><br>Background Describing the prevalence and trends of cardiometabolic risk factors that are associated with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is crucial for monitoring progress, planning prevention, and providing evidence to support policy efforts. We aimed to analyse the transition in body-mass index (BMI), obesity, blood pressure, raised blood pressure, and diabetes in the Americas, between 1980 and 2014. Methods We did a pooled analysis of population-based studies with data on anthropometric measurements, biomarkers for diabetes, and blood pressure from adults aged 18 years or older. A Bayesian model was used to estimate trends in BMI, raised blood pressure (systolic blood pressure =140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure =90 mm Hg), and diabetes (fasting plasma glucose =7.0 mmol/L, history of diabetes, or diabetes treatment) from 1980 to 2014, in 37 countries and six subregions of the Americas. Findings 389 population-based surveys from the Americas were available. Comparing prevalence estimates from 2014 with those of 1980, in the non-English speaking Caribbean subregion, the prevalence of obesity increased from 3.9% (95% CI 2.2-6.3) in 1980, to 18.6% (14.3-23.3) in 2014, in men; and from 12.2% (8.2-17.0) in 1980, to 30.5% (25.7-35.5) in 2014, in women. The English-speaking Caribbean subregion had the largest increase in the prevalence of diabetes, from 5.2% (2.1-10.4) in men and 6.4% (2.6-10.4) in women in 1980, to 11.1% (6.4-17.3) in men and 13.6% (8.2-21.0) in women in 2014). Conversely, the prevalence of raised blood pressure has decreased in all subregions; the largest decrease was found in North America from 27.6% (22.3-33.2) in men and 19.9% (15.8-24.4) in women in 1980, to 15.5% (11.1-20.9) in men and 10.7% (7.7-14.5) in women in 2014. Interpretation Despite the generally high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors across the Americas, estimates also showed a high level of heterogeneity in the transition between countries. The increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes observed over time requires appropriate measures to deal with these public health challenges. Our results support a diversification of health interventions across subregions and countries. © 2019 The Author(s).","<b>Phylogenetic relationships and systematics of the Amazonian poison frog genus Ameerega using ultraconserved genomic elements<\/b><br><br>The Amazonian poison frog genus Ameerega is one of the largest yet most understudied of the brightly colored genera in the anuran family Dendrobatidae, with 30 described species ranging throughout tropical South America. Phylogenetic analyses of Ameerega are highly discordant, lacking consistency due to variation in data types and methods, and often with limited coverage of species diversity in the genus. Here, we present a comprehensive phylogenomic reconstruction of Ameerega, utilizing state-of-the-art sequence capture techniques and phylogenetic methods. We sequenced thousands of ultraconserved elements from over 100 tissue samples, representing almost every described Ameerega species, as well as undescribed cryptic diversity. We generated topologies using maximum likelihood and coalescent methods and compared the use of maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods for estimating divergence times. Our phylogenetic inference diverged strongly from those of previous studies, and we recommend steps to bring Ameerega taxonomy in line with the new phylogeny. We place several species in a phylogeny for the first time, as well as provide evidence for six potential candidate species. We estimate that Ameerega experienced a rapid radiation approximately 7–11 million years ago and that the ancestor of all Ameerega was likely an aposematic, montane species. This study underscores the utility of phylogenomic data in improving our understanding of the phylogeny of understudied clades and making novel inferences about their evolution. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Population genetic structure and demographic history of the scallop Argopecten purpuratus from Peru and Northern Chile: implications for management and conservation of natural beds<\/b><br><br>The scallop Argopecten purpuratus is a heavily exploited resource along the coasts of Peru and north-central Chile, especially after El Niño events, when the species undergoes high increases in abundance.

We found high levels of genetic diversity in the analyzed populations. No geographical structuring was observed in the haplotype network, which consisted of a few central, widely distributed haplotypes, and many derived population-specific haplotypes separated by few mutations. This pattern suggests a recent population expansion and moderate to low current gene flow among populations.

Our objective was to examine inequalities in life expectancy in six large Latin American cities and its association with a measure of area-level socioeconomic status. Methods: In this ecological analysis, we used data from the Salud Urbana en America Latina (SALURBAL) study on six large cities in Latin America (Buenos Aires, Argentina; Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Santiago, Chile; San José, Costa Rica; Mexico City, Mexico; and Panama City, Panama), comprising 266 subcity units, for the period 2011–15 (expect for Panama city, which was for 2012–16). We calculated average life expectancy at birth by sex and subcity unit with life tables using age-specific mortality rates estimated from a Bayesian model, and calculated the difference between the ninth and first decile of life expectancy at birth (P90–P10 gap) across subcity units in cities. We also analysed the association between life expectancy at birth and socioeconomic status at the subcity-unit level, using education as a proxy for socioeconomic status, and whether any geographical patterns existed in cities between subcity units. Findings: We found large spatial differences in average life expectancy at birth in Latin American cities, with the largest P90–P10 gaps observed in Panama City (15·0 years for men and 14·7 years for women), Santiago (8·9 years for men and 17·7 years for women), and Mexico City (10·9 years for men and 9·4 years for women), and the narrowest in Buenos Aires (4·4 years for men and 5·8 years for women), Belo Horizonte (4·0 years for men and 6·5 years for women), and San José (3·9 years for men and 3·0 years for women). Higher area-level socioeconomic status was associated with higher life expectancy, especially in Santiago (change in life expectancy per P90–P10 change unit-level of educational attainment 8·0 years [95% CI 5·8–10·3] for men and 11·8 years [7·1–16·4] for women) and Panama City (7·3 years [2·6–12·1] for men and 9·0 years [2·4–15·5] for women). We saw an increase in life expectancy at birth from east to west in Panama City and from north to south in core Mexico City, and a core-periphery divide in Buenos Aires and Santiago. Whereas for San José the central part of the city had the lowest life expectancy and in Belo Horizonte the central part of the city had the highest life expectancy. Interpretation: Large spatial differences in life expectancy in Latin American cities and their association with social factors highlight the importance of area-based approaches and policies that address social inequalities in improving health in cities of the region.

Our main goal was to develop a robust habitat suitability model of Amazon-nut and to identify the most important predictor variables to support conservation and tree planting decisions. Localization: Amazon region, South America. Methods: We collected 3,325 unique Amazon-nut records and assembled >100 spatial predictor variables organized across climatic, edaphic, and geophysical categories. We compared suitability models using variables (a) selected through statistical techniques; (b) recommended by experts; and (c) integrating both approaches (a and b). We applied different spatial filtering scenarios to reduce overfitting. We additionally fine-tuned MAXENT settings to our data. The best model was selected through quantitative and qualitative assessments. Results: Principal component analysis based on expert recommendations was the most appropriate method for predictor selection. Elevation, coarse soil fragments, clay, slope, and annual potential evapotranspiration were the most important predictors. Their relative contribution to the best model amounted to 75%. Filtering of the presences within a radius of 10 km displayed lowest overfitting, a satisfactory omission rate and the most symmetric distribution curve. Our findings suggest that under current environmental conditions, suitable habitat for Amazon-nut is found across 2.3 million km2, that is, 32% of the Amazon Biome. Main conclusion: The combination of statistical techniques with expert knowledge improved the quality of our suitability model. Topographic and soil variables were the most important predictors. The combination of predictor variable selection, fine-tuning of model parameters and spatial filtering was critical for the construction of a reliable habitat suitability model. © 2019 The Authors.

The Q α-value prediction of the ten parameter Duflo-Zuker mass model has been improved from a root-mean-square deviation relative to the experimental data σ = 0.43 MeV to σ = 0.122 MeV. This correction brought to light some missing physical aspects in the DZ mass model, so as to identify some magic numbers not present in the original model. By using a phenomenological effective model to deal with alpha decay half-lives, we were able to obtain the half-life values throughout the superheavy elements region. As a main result, we found that the region of greatest stability against the alpha-decay process for superheavy elements is between 106 ≤ Z ≤ 110 and 180 ≤ N ≤ 184. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","<b>Bayesian estimation of a flexible bifactor generalized partial credit model to survey data<\/b><br><br>Item response theory (IRT) models provide an important contribution in the analysis of polytomous items, such as Likert scale items in survey data.

Using genome-wide and phylogenetic approaches, we investigated osmotin origin and diversification across plant TLP evolution. Genomic and protein in silico analysis tools were also accessed and considered for the study conclusions. Phylogenetic analysis including a total of 722 sequences from 32 Viridiplantae species allowed the identification of an osmotin group that includes all previously characterized osmotins. Based on the phylogenetic tree results, it is evident that the osmotin group emerged from spermatophytes. Phylogenetic separation and gene expansion could be accounted for by an exclusive motif composition and organization that emerged and was maintained following tandem and block duplications as well as natural selection. The TLP family conserved residues and structures that were also identified in the sequences of the osmotin group, thus suggesting their maintenance for defense responses. The gene expression of Arabidopsis and rice putative osmotins reinforces its roles during stress response. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","<b>Genome-wide Association Analysis for resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis virus identifies candidate genes involved in viral replication and immune response in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)<\/b><br><br>Infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) is a viral disease with considerable negative impact on the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) aquaculture industry. The aim of the present work was to detect genomic regions that explain resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) in rainbow trout. A total of 2,278 fish from 58 full-sib families were challenged with IPNV and 768 individuals were genotyped (488 resistant and 280 susceptible), using a 57K SNP panel Axiom, Affymetrix. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using the phenotypes time to death (TD) and binary survival (BS), along with the genotypes of the challenged fish using a Bayesian model (Bayes C). Heritabilities for resistance to IPNV estimated using genomic information, were 0.53 and 0.82 for TD and BS, respectively. The Bayesian GWAS detected a SNP located on chromosome 5 explaining 19% of the genetic variance for TD. The proximity of Sentrin-specific protease 5 (SENP5) to this SNP makes it a candidate gene for resistance against IPNV. In case of BS, a SNP located on chromosome 23 was detected explaining 9% of the genetic variance. However, the moderate-low proportion of variance explained by the detected marker leads to the conclusion that the incorporation of all genomic information, through genomic selection, would be the most appropriate approach to accelerate genetic progress for the improvement of resistance against IPNV in rainbow trout. © 2019 Genetics Society of America.

The complex geology of the Andes and paleoclimate fluctuations within the Quaternary suggest complex speciation scenarios. This, in turn, has contributed to idiosyncratic speciation modes among shallowly diverged Amazonian taxa. Many relationships among these taxa remain poorly resolved. Here we use a sequence capture approach, ultraconserved elements (UCEs), to address the phylogenetic relationships among three recently diverged Peruvian Ameerega poison frog species (A. cainarachi, A. petersi, and A. smaragdina; family Dendrobatidae)and explore a possible mode of speciation in this group. We assess concordance among concatenated phylogenetic tree inference, gene-tree based species tree inference, SNP-based species tree inference, and Bayes factor lineage delimitation to resolve species boundaries. We complement these analyses with assessments of call divergence to address the presence of a prezygotic reproductive barrier. Additionally, we further explore the phylogeographic history of these species of Ameerega with demographic inference, considering evidence for admixture and population expansions. Our results support the synonymy of A. smaragdina as a junior synonym of A. petersi and we find that speciation in this group is characterized by admixture and signatures of a population bottleneck followed by expansion. We invoke the disturbance-vicariance hypothesis to explain the observed patterns and call for more, detailed investigations of in-situ speciation in the Tropical Andes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","<b>An assessment of species limits of the South American mouse genus Oligoryzomys (Rodentia, Cricetidae) using unilocus delimitation methods<\/b><br><br>Oligoryzomys, as currently understood is formed by 25 living species, is the most diverse genus of the tribe Oryzomyini of the New World subfamily Sigmodontinae of cricetid rodents. Nonetheless, the species richness of Oligoryzomys seems to be an underestimate, given some species complex has been proposed in previous studies, at the time that large geographic areas remain to be sampled, and several taxonomic forms have not been assessed with contemporary approaches. In this study, we present a new assessment of the species diversity of Oligoryzomys based on multiple unilocus species delimitation methods (ABGD, BPP, PTP, GMYC and b GMYC), using 665 cytb gene sequences as evidence (532 gathered from Genbank and 133 obtained in this study). We sampled representatives of almost all currently known species of Oligoryzomys, at the time that extending the geographic coverage to the Central Andes, a large area that was largely unrepresented in previous studies. Phylogenetic relationships, based on a non-redundant alignment, were inferred via maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference; an ultrametric tree, used in species delimitation analyses, was obtained using multiple secondary calibration points. Results of species delimitation methods are discussed at the light of previous knowledge (e.g., taxonomic history and geographic provenance of samples in relation to type localities) and the morphological assessments of some specimens. Results of the distinct delimitation methods are mostly congruent, being BPP and PTP the most sensible to estimate species delimitation, allowing us to suggest that Oligoryzomys is composed of 30 lineages of species level. Of these, 22 correspond to forms currently considered species; some of these include in their synonymy some forms currently considered valid species (e.g., yatesi would be a synonym of longicaudatus). The remaining eight lineages are candidate species that need to be further evaluated. This study, by advancing taxonomic hypothesis that should be further tested in future studies, constitutes a stepping-stone for upcoming taxonomic and biogeographic studies centred on Oligoryzomys. © 2019 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences","<b>Dispersal and local persistence shape the genetic structure of a widespread Neotropical plant species with a patchy distribution<\/b><br><br>Background and Aims: Isolated populations constitute an ideal laboratory to study the consequences of intraspecific divergence, because intrinsic incompatibilities are more likely to accumulate under reduced gene flow. Here, we use a widespread bromeliad with a patchy distribution, Pitcairnia lanuginosa, as a model to infer processes driving Neotropical diversification and, thus, to improve our understanding of the origin and evolutionary dynamics of biodiversity in this highly speciose region. Methods: We assessed the timing of lineage divergence, genetic structural patterns and historical demography of P. lanuginosa, based on microsatellites, and plastid and nuclear sequence data sets using coalescent analyses and an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework. Additionally, we used species distribution models (SDMs) to independently estimate potential changes in habitat suitability. Key Results: Despite morphological uniformity, plastid and nuclear DNA data revealed two distinct P. lanuginosa lineages that probably diverged through dispersal from the Cerrado to the Central Andean Yungas, following the final uplift of the Andes, and passed through long-term isolation with no evidence of migration. Microsatellite data indicate low genetic diversity and high levels of inbreeding within populations, and restricted gene flow among populations, which are likely to be a consequence of bottlenecks (or founder events), and high selfing rates promoting population persistence in isolation. SDMs showed a slight expansion of the suitable range for P. lanuginosa lineages during the Last Glacial Maximum, although molecular data revealed a signature of older divergence. Pleistocene climatic oscillations thus seem to have played only a minor role in the diversification of P. lanuginosa, which probably persisted through adverse conditions in riparian forests. Conclusions: Our results imply drift as a major force shaping the evolution of P. lanuginosa, and suggest that dispersal events have a prominent role in connecting Neotropical open and forest biomes. © 2019 The Author(s).

While Agarophyton vermiculophyllum is a well known example of an algal invader worldwide, its congeneric species A. chilensis has mainly remained within its original distribution range for thousands of years, and was only engaged in a few dispersal journeys to arrive from New Zealand to Chile over 19,000 years ago. Nowadays, A. chilensis is intensively farmed along the Chilean coast and the establishment of new populations has mostly been due to intentional/planned cultivation practices. No other source of range expansion has ever been reported, since its first description. However, in 2014 it was sighted for the first time at the docking of a small artisanal port in Peru, which nowadays represents its northernmost population. We genetically assessed 60 specimens taken from Peru in 2015 and 2017, using two different types of molecular markers (the ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer 2, ITS2 and six nuclear microsatellites). Altogether, our results suggest the population in Perú to be an unattached, vegetative, single male's clonal population. This population has sustained itself successfully, reproducing asexually through fragmentation, for at least four consecutive years and seems to have expanded in the area. The ITS2 sequences from these individuals corresponds all to one haplotype, the one ubiquitous among populations from Chile, the eastern coast of New Zealand and the Chatham Islands, not allowing to narrow down the potential area of origin of the Peruvian population. Based on first the allelic frequencies of six microsatellite loci estimated for 28 Chilean and five loci for seven New Zealander populations and second the analyses of Bayesian clustering, we propose the natural or unintentional anthropogenic introduction of a single male's thallus from Chile to be the source of the Peruvian population. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Incorporating the Q-Matrix Into Multidimensional Item Response Theory Models<\/b><br><br>Multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) models use data from individual item responses to estimate multiple latent traits of interest, making them useful in educational and psychological measurement, among other areas. When MIRT models are applied in practice, it is not uncommon to see that some items are designed to measure all latent traits while other items may only measure one or two traits. In order to facilitate a clear expression of which items measure which traits and formulate such relationships as a math function in MIRT models, we applied the concept of the Q-matrix commonly used in diagnostic classification models to MIRT models. In this study, we introduced how to incorporate a Q-matrix into an existing MIRT model, and demonstrated benefits of the proposed hybrid model through two simulation studies and an applied study. In addition, we showed the relative ease in modeling educational and psychological data through a Bayesian approach via the NUTS algorithm. © The Author(s) 2018.","<b>Uncovering Value Drivers of High Performance Soccer Players<\/b><br><br>This article tries to uncover the drivers of soccer players’ market value in the five major European soccer leagues taking into account model uncertainty (variable selection) in a framework with 35 billion potential models.

Known as Brazilian pine, A. angustifolia is the only native conifer species with economic and social relevance in this country. Due to massive exploitation, it has suffered a significant population decline and currently is classified as critically endangered. This encouraged the scientific community to investigate genetic features in Brazilian pine to increase resources for management and preservation. In this work, RNA-Seq data was used to determine the complete nucleotide sequence of the A. angustifolia chloroplast genome (cpDNA). The cpDNA is 146,203 bp in length and contains 122 genes, including 80 protein-coding genes, 5 ribosomal RNA genes, and 37 tRNA genes. Coding regions comprise 45.02%, 4.96% correspond to rRNAs and tRNAs, and 50.02% of the genome encompasses non-coding regions. Genes found in the inverted repeat (IR) are present as single copy, with exception of the rrn5 and trnI-CAU loci. The typical LSC, SSC, IRa and IRb organization reported in several land-plant groups is not present in A. angustifolia cpDNA. Phylogenetic analyses using Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods clustered A. angustifolia in the Araucariaceae family, with A. heterophylla and A. columnaris as congeneric species. The screening of A. angustifolia cpDNA reveled 100 SSRs, 14 of them corresponding to tetrapolymer loci. © 2019, Brazilian Journal of Genetics.

The study provides a detailed description of the procedure to couple the system ARPS-tTEB and analyzed the simulation results of the 12 January 2015 sea-breeze event that developed a severe thunderstorm above the metropolitan area of São Paulo (MASP), Brazil. The simulation used realistic boundary and initial conditions from the Global Forecast System (GFS) and sea surface temperature (SST) from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM). The system ARPS-tTEB runs of up to 3 km horizontal resolution were carried out with high resolution topography features and land-use types currently available for Southeastern Brazil. The simulated spatial distribution of precipitation was verified against the Climate Prediction Center Morphing Technique (CMORPH), the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) and the São Paulo weather radar (SPWR) precipitation estimates by indexes scores. Time series of grid precipitation estimates (ARPS-tTEB and SPWR) and point measurements (rain gauges) were evaluated with a Bayesian statistical method. Results indicate that the urban area of the MASP modulates the precipitation spatial distribution over it. Furthermore, phase and amplitude precipitation accuracy increased with the 3D urban canyon and the urban energy budget scheme in relationship to control runs without urban environment effects. © 2019 by the authors.","<b>Performance of asymmetric links and correction methods for imbalanced data in binary regression<\/b><br><br>In binary regression, imbalanced data result from the presence of values equal to zero (or one) in a proportion that is significantly greater than the corresponding real values of one (or zero). In this work, we evaluate two methods developed to deal with imbalanced data and compare them to the use of asymmetric links. The results based on simulation study show, that correction methods do not adequately correct bias in the estimation of regression coefficients and that the models with power links and reverse power considered produce better results for certain types of imbalanced data. Additionally, we present an application for imbalanced data, identifying the best model among the various ones proposed. The parameters are estimated using a Bayesian approach, considering the Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo method, utilizing the No-U-Turn Sampler algorithm and the comparisons of models were developed using different criteria for model comparison, predictive evaluation and quantile residuals. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","<b>Deeply conserved susceptibility in a multi-host, multi-parasite system<\/b><br><br>Variation in susceptibility is ubiquitous in multi-host, multi-parasite assemblages, and can have profound implications for ecology and evolution in these systems. The extent to which susceptibility to parasites is phylogenetically conserved among hosts can be revealed by analysing diverse regional communities. We screened for haemosporidian parasites in 3983 birds representing 40 families and 523 species, spanning ~ 4500 m elevation in the tropical Andes. To quantify the influence of host phylogeny on infection status, we applied Bayesian phylogenetic multilevel models that included a suite of environmental, spatial, temporal, life history and ecological predictors. We found evidence of deeply conserved susceptibility across the avian tree; host phylogeny explained substantial variation in infection status, and results were robust to phylogenetic uncertainty. Our study suggests that susceptibility is governed, in part, by conserved, latent aspects of anti-parasite defence. This demonstrates the importance of deep phylogeny for understanding present-day ecological interactions. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","<b>Bayesian semiparametric modeling for HIV longitudinal data with censoring and skewness<\/b><br><br>In biomedical studies, the analysis of longitudinal data based on Gaussian assumptions is common practice. Nevertheless, more often than not, the observed responses are naturally skewed, rendering the use of symmetric mixed effects models inadequate. In addition, it is also common in clinical assays that the patient’s responses are subject to some upper and/or lower quantification limit, depending on the diagnostic assays used for their detection. Furthermore, responses may also often present a nonlinear relation with some covariates, such as time. To address the aforementioned three issues, we consider a Bayesian semiparametric longitudinal censored model based on a combination of splines, wavelets, and the skew-normal distribution. Specifically, we focus on the use of splines to approximate the general mean, wavelets for modeling the individual subject trajectories, and on the skew-normal distribution for modeling the random effects.

Here, we test the hypothesis that QUALIS A1 Journals in the Environmental Science area use more complex statistical analyses. We describe the tests offered by graduate programs with PhD degree in Environmental Sciences. A total of 33.5% of 1560 papers evaluated had no statistical analysis. A1 journals used more T-Test, Chi-Square and Mann-Whitney tests than B1 journals. We found no difference between the use of univariate, multivariate and Bayesian analyses. In Brazil, there are 37 graduate programs in Environmental Sciences, of which 10 do not offer statistics course. Among the 38 courses offered, 73.7% provide only univariate statistics and 34.2% provide multivariate statistics. We conclude that quality in papers is not dependable on the complexity of statistical analyses, but on their theoretical framework. © 2019 Centro Universitario de Anapolis.

These large, correlated datasets pose statistical challenges requiring advanced statistical techniques to appropriately interpret and model animal movement. We used satellite telemetry data of critically endangered Eastern Pacific leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) to develop a habitat-based model of their motility (and conversely residence time) using a hierarchical Bayesian framework, which could be broadly applied across species. To account for the spatiotemporally auto-correlated, unbalanced, and presence-only telemetry observations, in combination with dynamic environmental variables, a novel modeling approach was applied. We expanded a Poisson generalized linear model in a continuous-time discrete-space (CTDS) model framework to predict individual leatherback movement based on environmental drivers, such as sea surface temperature. Population-level movement estimates were then obtained with a Bayesian approach and used to create monthly, near real-time predictions of Eastern Pacific leatherback movement in the South Pacific Ocean. This model framework will inform the development of a dynamic ocean management model, “South Pacific TurtleWatch (SPTW),” and could be applied to telemetry data from other populations and species to predict motility and residence times in dynamic environments, while accounting for statistical uncertainties arising at multiple stages of telemetry analysis. © 2019 The Authors.","<b>Asymmetries in Volatility: An Empirical Study for the Peruvian Stock and Forex Markets<\/b><br><br>Asymmetric autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) models and asymmetric stochastic volatility (ASV) models are applied to daily data of Peruvian stock and Forex markets for the period of 5 January 1998-30 December 2011. Following the approach developed in [Omori, Y, S Chib, N Shephard and J Nakajima (2007). Stochastic volatility with leverage: Fast likelihood inference. Journal of Econometrics, 140, 425-449], Bayesian estimation tools are used with Normal and t-Student errors in both models. The results suggest the significant presence of asymmetric effects in both markets. In the stock market, negative shocks generate higher volatility than positive shocks. In the Forex market, shocks related to episodes of depreciation create higher uncertainty in comparison with episodes of appreciation. Thus, the Central Reserve Bank faces relatively major difficulties in its intention of smoothing Forex volatility in times of depreciation. The model with the best fit in both markets is the ASV model with Normal errors. The stock market returns have greater periods of volatility; however, both markets react to shocks in the economy, as they display similar patterns and have a significant correlation for the sample period studied. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Co.","<b>Sensitivity analysis and choosing between alternative polytomous IRT models using Bayesian model comparison criteria<\/b><br><br>Polytomous Item Response Theory (IRT) models are used by specialists to score assessments and questionnaires that have items with multiple response categories.

Supervised classification algorithms aim at producing a learning model from a labeled training set. Different methods and approaches have been proposed to overcome the two-class classification problem. Among the existing techniques in literature, the classifier based on Straight Line Segments (SLS Classifier) is worthy of note. This technique is based on distances between points and two sets of straight line segments, whose initial positions are obtained by applying the K-Means algorithm. Then, the gradient descent method finds its optimal positions that minimize the Mean Squared Error. This paper aims to study the impact of the initial positions on the classifier accuracy. For this purpose, we performed two experiments to demonstrate the stability of the classifier performance when the initial positions are not optimal (close to the samples): (i) random initial positions and; (ii) k-means positions displaced by adding Gaussian and uniform noises. In addition, we perform a comparison with positions obtained using different clustering algorithms. As expected, the results suggest that with an increased noise level, the classification rate decreases, however, such reduction was not significant as compared when using the random initial positions. It is worth mentioning that in most of the experiments, the classification rate of the SLS and the Bayes classifier are comparable. © 2018 IEEE.","<b>Taxonomic evaluation of the marsupial frog Gastrotheca peruana (Amphibia: Hemiphractidae) based on mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene<\/b><br><br>The taxonomic status of Gastrotheca peruana is evaluated using phylogenetic methods and 16S gene sequences.

The Qα-value prediction using a set of ten different mass models has been greatly improved for all models when compared to the available experimental data. In addition, we have used the improved Qα-value to determine the SHE α-decay half-lives with a well-succeeded model in the literature, currently employed for different hadronic nuclear decay modes of heavy nuclei, the E ffective L iquid D rop M odel (ELDM).

In the Peruvian Amazon, this vector has been expanding to rural communities over the last 10-15 years, but to date, the population genetic structure of Ae. aegypti in this region has not been characterized. To investigate the relationship between Ae. aegypti gene flow and human transportation networks, we characterized mosquito population structure using a panel of 8 microsatellite markers and linked results to various potential mechanisms for long-distance dispersal. Adult and immature Ae. aegypti (>20 individuals per site) were collected from Iquitos city and from six neighboring riverine communities, i.e., Nauta, Indiana, Mazan, Barrio Florida, Tamshiaco, and Aucayo. FST statistics indicate significant, but low to moderate differentiation for the majority of study site pairs. Population structure of Ae. aegypti is not correlated with the geographic distance between towns, suggesting that human transportation networks provide a reasonable explanation for the high levels of population mixing. Our results indicate that Ae. aegypti gene flow among sub-populations is greatest between locations with heavy boat traffic, such as Iquitos-Tamshiaco and Iquitos-Indiana-Mazan, and lowest between locations with little or no boat/road traffic between them such as Barrio Florida-Iquitos. Bayesian clustering analysis showed ancestral admixture among three genetic clusters; no single cluster was exclusive to any site. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that human transportation networks, particularly riverways, are responsible for the geographic spread of Ae. aegypti in the Peruvian Amazon. Our findings are applicable to other regions of the world characterized by networks of urban islands connected by fluvial transport routes. © 2019 This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

In this manuscript, a convenient parametrization of this distribution is proposed in order to develop regression models. This distribution, referred to here as L-Logistic distribution, provides great flexibility and includes the uniform distribution as a particular case. Several properties of this distribution are studied, and a Bayesian approach is adopted for the parameter estimation. Simulation studies, considering prior sensitivity analysis, recovery of parameters and comparison of algorithms, and robustness to outliers are all discussed showing that the results are insensitive to the choice of priors, efficiency of the algorithm MCMC adopted, and robustness of the model when compared with the beta distribution. Applications to estimate the vulnerability to poverty and to explain the anxiety are performed.

The spatial behavior of this species tends to be very dynamic at different spatial scales, influenced mostly by its biomass level and environmental factors. The aim of this study was to analyze temporal and spatial fluctuations in anchovy spatial distribution off Peru, based and modeled on acoustic data, focusing on large- and meso-scale spatial structures. We employed data from 41 scientific surveys (1994–2016) and Bayesian hierarchical spatial models to obtain the anchovy's spatial distribution, allowing us to identify spatial structures at specific scales. Our results showed similar temporal trends in the number of mesoscale structures, their areas and anchovy density, exhibiting altogether two breakpoints in the time series: ~1999 and ~2013. The last period (2013–2016) was similar to the earlier one (1994–1999), in terms of low values of mesoscale structure indicators. On the other hand, we identified four spatial scenarios differentiated by the aggregative behavior, which were highly influenced by seasons and El Niño events. Each scenario had recurrent, or fidelity, areas placed in different locations. For instance, for the ‘El Niño scenario’ a particularly coastal recurrent area was identified, which might be a refuge zone for this species during these unfavorable events. Finally, we assessed differences in biomass estimates of each scenario. The highest biomass values were estimated for the ‘Summer favorable scenario’ and the lowest ones for the ‘El Niño scenario’ which supports the MacCall's basin hypothesis for this species. This study expands the current knowledge of the Peruvian anchovy and it is a first step to understand the effects on this species of the last El Niño events (2014–2016) that occurred in the northern Humboldt Current System. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","<b>An unusual new record of Baccharis (Asteraceae) from the Peruvian Andes and its relation with the northern limit of the dry puna<\/b><br><br>Antecedentes y Objetivos: El conocimiento de la riqueza y distribución de la flora en los Andes peruanos es escaso; en la última década han habido alrededor de 70 novedades taxonómicas para esta área, siendo la familia Asteraceae la de mayor aporte.

The species was collected in the south of the Peruvian Andes. This record extends the known distribution of the species considerably to the north. Conclusions: This record suggests the need to continue studying the Andean flora, as well as the links of their distribution patterns with the phytogeographical regions. © 2018, Instituto de Ecologiao.","<b>Adaptive Serious Game as a Learning Approach for Microbiology<\/b><br><br>Multiple factors contribute to the negative experience and disinterest of medical students on the perception of the Microbiology course [1]. In this paper, an Adaptive Serious Game is proposed as a more entertaining educational approach to motivate and to improve the performance of medical students on a Microbiology subject. To achieve that, a Bayesian Network model constructed from expert knowledge and a Role-Playing game design were proposed. To validate our proposal, a playability survey was applied to 36 college students. These students were divided in two groups for evaluating their performance with and without an adaptability feature. Overall, the results suggest the game is attractive, enjoyable and useful tool for learning. Moreover, the use of Bayesian networks contributes to the success performance ratio of the students. © 2018 IEEE.","<b>A Bayesian Classifier Based on Constraints of Ordering of Variables for Fraud Detection<\/b><br><br>Fraud detection is important for financial institutions and the society. Supervised machine learning techniques were applied for fraud detection. However, mostly discriminative techniques were applied on these problems. Probabilistic graphical models can also detect fraud, providing also a graphical representation of its reasoning scheme as a graph. We proposed a method to generate a probabilistic graphical model for fraud detection, using constraints related to the domain. We achieved 99.272% of accuracy and we outperformed other baselines techniques of probabilistic graphical models. We demonstrated that constraints are important to tackle complex problem such a fraud detection. © 2018 IEEE.","<b>Comparative analysis of mosquito trap counts in the Peruvian Amazon: Effect of trap type and other covariates on counts and diversity<\/b><br><br>Efficient detection of multiple species of adult mosquitoes in various habitats using effective traps is a crucial 1st step in any disease prevention program. Novel trap types that target tropical vectors of human diseases require field testing in the habitat of the vector-disease system in question. This paper analyzes a series of mosquito trapping studies conducted at Mapacocha, San Juan Bautista District, Loreto, Peru, during August- September 2013 and April-May 2014. Six trap configurations were evaluated in forest and rural locations. Adult mosquito counts were analyzed using full Bayesian inference of multilevel generalized linear models and posterior probability point estimates of the difference of means of the combined trap catch by trap type comparisons of all species. Light traps (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] incandescent, white light-emitting diode [LED], and ultraviolet LED) caught greater numbers of mosquitoes compared with traps baited with yeast-generated CO2 and Biogents Sentinele traps (battery powered traps without light and passive box traps). However, diversity measures (species richness, evenness, and similarity) were consistently nearly equal among trap types. Arbovirus vectors were more common in forest locations, while malaria vectors were more common near human habitations. Location had a significant effect on trap effectiveness and mosquito diversity, with traps from forest locations having greater numbers and greater species richness, compared with traps set near human habitations. The results of this study will inform mosquito surveillance trap choices in remote regions of central South America, including regions with emerging tropical diseases, such and dengue and Zika virus. © 2018 by The American Mosquito Control Association, Inc.","<b>Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling of anchovy abundance through the SPDE Approach<\/b><br><br>The Peruvian anchovy is an important species from an ecological and economical perspective. Some important features to evaluate fisheries management are the relationship between the anchovy presence/abundance and covariates with spatial and temporal dependencies accounted for, the nature of the behaviour of anchovy throughout space and time, and available spatio-temporal predictions. With these challenges in mind, we propose to use flexible Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal models for zero-inflated positive continuous data. These models are able to capture the spatial and temporal distribution of the anchovies, to make spatial predictions within the temporal range of the data and predictions about the near future. To make our modelling computationally feasible we use the stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) approach combined with the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) method. After balancing goodness of fit, interpretations of spatial effects across years, prediction ability, and computational costs, we suggest to use a model with a spatio-temporal structure. Our model provides a novel method to investigate the Peruvian anchovy dynamics across years, giving solid statistical support to many descriptive ecological studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Stochastic Volatility in the Peruvian Stock Market and Exchange Rate Returns: A Bayesian Approximation<\/b><br><br>This study is one of the first to utilize the stochastic volatility (SV) model to modelling the Peruvian financial times series. We estimate and compare this model with generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models with normal and t-student errors. The analysis in this study corresponds to Peru’s stock market and exchange rate returns. The importance of this methodology is that the adjustment of the data is better than the GARCH models, using the assumptions of normality in both models. In the case of the SV model, three Bayesian algorithms have been employed where we evaluate their respective inefficiencies in the estimation of the model’s parameters—the most efficient being the integration sampler. The estimated parameters in the SV model under the various algorithms are consistent, as they display little inefficiency. The figures of the correlations of the iterations suggest that there are no problems at the time of Markov chaining in all estimations. We find that the volatilities in the exchange rate and stock market volatilities follow similar patterns over time. That is, when economic turbulence caused by the economic circumstances occurred, for example, the Asian crisis and the recent crisis in the USA, considerable volatility was generated in both markets.

Inhabiting terrestrial and aquatic environments, most are free-living saprophytes but several species cause important diseases: e.g. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, responsible for worldwide amphibian decline; and Synchytrium endobioticum, causing potato wart disease. S. endobioticum has an obligate biotrophic lifestyle and isolates can be further characterized as pathotypes based on their virulence on a differential set of potato cultivars. Quarantine measures have been implemented globally to control the disease and prevent its spread. We used a comparative approach using chytrid mitogenomes to determine taxonomical relationships and to gain insights into the evolution and recent history of introductions of this plant pathogen. RESULTS: We assembled and annotated the complete mitochondrial genome of 30 S. endobioticum isolates and generated mitochondrial genomes for five additional chytrid species. The mitochondrial genome of S. endobioticum is linear with terminal inverted repeats which was validated by tailing and PCR amplifying the telomeric ends. Surprisingly, no conservation in organisation and orientation of mitochondrial genes was observed among the Chytridiomycota except for S. endobioticum and its sister species Synchytrium microbalum. However, the mitochondrial genome of S. microbalum is circular and comprises only a third of the 72.9 Kbp found for S. endobioticum suggesting recent linearization and expansion. Four mitochondrial lineages were identified in the S. endobioticum mitochondrial genomes. Several pathotypes occur in different lineages, suggesting that these have emerged independently. In addition, variations for polymorphic sites in the mitochondrial genome of individual isolates were observed demonstrating that S. endobioticum isolates represent a community of different genotypes. Such communities were shown to be complex and stable over time, but we also demonstrate that the use of semi-resistant potato cultivars triggers a rapid shift in the mitochondrial haplotype associated with increased virulence. CONCLUSIONS: Mitochondrial genomic variation shows that S. endobioticum has been introduced into Europe multiple times, that several pathotypes emerged multiple times, and that isolates represent communities of different genotypes. Our study represents the most comprehensive dataset of chytrid mitogenomes, which provides new insights into the extraordinary dynamics and evolution of mitochondrial genomes involving linearization, expansion and reshuffling.","<b>Investigating spillover of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis from a prison: A spatial and molecular epidemiological analysis<\/b><br><br>Background: Congregate settings may serve as institutional amplifiers of tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). We analyze spatial, epidemiological, and pathogen genetic data prospectively collected from neighborhoods surrounding a prison in Lima, Peru, where inmates experience a high risk of MDR-TB, to investigate the risk of spillover into the surrounding community. Methods: Using hierarchical Bayesian statistical modeling, we address three questions regarding the MDR-TB risk: (i) Does the excess risk observed among prisoners also extend outside the prison? (ii) If so, what is the magnitude, shape, and spatial range of this spillover effect? (iii) Is there evidence of additional transmission across the region? Results: The region of spillover risk extends for 5.47km outside of the prison (95% credible interval: 1.38, 9.63km). Within this spillover region, we find that nine of the 467 non-inmate patients (35 with MDR-TB) have MDR-TB strains that are genetic matches to strains collected from current inmates with MDR-TB, compared to seven out of 1080 patients (89 with MDR-TB) outside the spillover region (p values: 0.022 and 0.008). We also identify eight spatially aggregated genetic clusters of MDR-TB, four within the spillover region, consistent with local transmission among individuals living close to the prison. Conclusions: We demonstrate a clear prison spillover effect in this population, which suggests that interventions in the prison may have benefits that extend to the surrounding community. © 2018 The Author(s).","<b>An empirical application of a stochastic volatility model with GH skew Student's t-distribution to the volatility of Latin-American stock returns<\/b><br><br>Using daily stocks returns data of a set of Latin-American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru) for the sample period 1996:01–2013:12, we estimate a stochastic volatility model incorporating both leverage effects and skewed heavy-tailed disturbances through of the GH Skew Student's t-distribution based on Bayesian estimation method proposed by Nakajima and Omori (2012). Two alternative models are estimated, one using an alternative Skew Student's t-distribution and the other using a symmetric Student's t-distribution. The results suggest the presence of leverage effects in all markets except for Peru where the evidence is unclear. In addition, there is evidence of asymmetries and heavy tails in the Argentina and S&P500 markets while in the other countries there is no robust evidence of such characteristics. Using the Bayes factor, the results indicate that the SVGHSkewt model dominates the other two models for the cases of Peru, Argentina, Brazil and S&P500 whereas the simple SVt model is preferred for the markets of Mexico and Chile. Similar findings are obtained after performing a robustness analysis regarding the priors of the parameters associated with the skewness and the tails of the distribution. © 2018 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","<b>Exploration of Plasmodium vivax transmission dynamics and recurrent infections in the Peruvian Amazon using whole genome sequencing<\/b><br><br>Background: Plasmodium vivax poses a significant challenge to malaria elimination due to its ability to cause relapsed infections from reactivation of dormant liver parasites called hypnozoites. We analyzed 69 P. vivax whole genome sequences obtained from subjects residing in three different villages along the Peruvian Amazon. This included 23 paired P. vivax samples from subjects who experienced recurrent P. vivax parasitemia following observed treatment with chloroquine and primaquine. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples collected from subjects. P. vivax DNA was enriched using selective whole genome amplification and whole genome sequencing. We used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the core P. vivax genome to determine characteristics of the parasite population using discriminant analysis of principal components, maximum likelihood estimation of individual ancestries, and phylogenetic analysis. We estimated the relatedness of the paired samples by calculating the number of segregating sites and using a hidden Markov model approach to estimate identity by descent. Results: We present a comprehensive dataset of population genetics of Plasmodium vivax in the Peruvian Amazonian. We define the parasite population structure in this region and demonstrate a novel method for distinguishing homologous relapses from reinfections or heterologous relapses with improved accuracy. The parasite population in this area was quite diverse with an estimated five subpopulations and evidence of a highly heterogeneous ancestry of some of the isolates, similar to previous analyses of P. vivax in this region. Pairwise comparison of recurrent infections determined that there were 12 homologous relapses and 3 likely heterologous relapses with highly related parasites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to evaluate recurrent P. vivax infections using whole genome sequencing. Conclusions: Whole genome sequencing is a high-resolution tool that can identify P. vivax homologous relapses with increased sensitivity, while also providing data about drug resistance and parasite population genetics. This information is important for evaluating the efficacy of known and novel antirelapse medications in endemic areas and thus advancing the campaign to eliminate malaria. © 2018 The Author(s).","<b>A beta-inflated mean regression model with mixed effects for fractional response variables<\/b><br><br>In this article we propose a new mixed-effects regression model for fractional bounded response variables. Our model allows us to incorporate covariates directly to the expected value, so we can quantify exactly the influence of these covariates in the mean of the variable of interest rather than to the conditional mean. Estimation is carried out from a Bayesian perspective. Due to the complexity of the augmented posterior distribution, we use a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm, the No-U-Turn sampler, implemented using the Stan software. A simulation study was performed showing that our model has a better performance than other traditional longitudinal models for bounded variables. Finally, we applied our beta-inflated mean mixed-effects regression model to real data which consists of utilization of credit lines in the peruvian financial system. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","<b>The transmission dynamics and diversity of human metapneumovirus in Peru<\/b><br><br>Background: The transmission dynamics of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in tropical countries remain unclear. Further understanding of the genetic diversity of the virus could aid in HMPV vaccine design and improve our understanding of respiratory virus transmission dynamics in low- and middle-income countries. Materials & Methods: We examined the evolution of HMPV in Peru through phylogenetic analysis of 61 full genome HMPV sequences collected in three ecologically diverse regions of Peru (Lima, Piura, and Iquitos) during 2008-2012, comprising the largest data set of HMPV whole genomes sequenced from any tropical country to date. Results: We revealed extensive genetic diversity generated by frequent viral introductions, with little evidence of local persistence. While considerable viral traffic between non-Peruvian countries and Peru was observed, HMPV epidemics in Peruvian locales were more frequently epidemiologically linked with other sites within Peru. We showed that Iquitos experienced greater HMPV traffic than the similar sized city of Piura by both Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods. Conclusions: There is extensive HMPV genetic diversity even within smaller and relatively less connected cities of Peru and this virus is spatially fluid. Greater diversity of HMPV in Iquitos compared to Piura may relate to higher volumes of human movement, including air traffic to this location. © 2017 The Authors.

Coupling top predators’ population studies with independent records of prey abundance suggests that prey fluctuations affect fecundity parameters and abundance of their predators. However, prey may be abundant but inaccessible to their predators and a major challenge is to determine the relative importance of prey accessibility in shaping seabird populations. In addition, disentangling the effects of prey abundance and accessibility from the effects of prey removal by fisheries, while accounting for density dependence, remains challenging for marine top predators. Here, we investigate how climate, population density, and the accessibility and removal of prey (the Peruvian anchovy Engraulis ringens) by fisheries influence the population dynamics of the largest sedentary seabird community (≈ 4 million individuals belonging to guanay cormorant Phalacrocorax bougainvillii, Peruvian booby Sula variegata and Peruvian pelican Pelecanus thagus) of the northern Humboldt Current System over the past half-century. Using Gompertz state–space models we found strong evidence for density dependence in abundance for the three seabird species. After accounting for density dependence, sea surface temperature, prey accessibility (defined by the depth of the upper limit of the subsurface oxygen minimum zone) and prey removal by fisheries were retained as the best predictors of annual population size across species. These factors affected seabird abundance the current year and with year lags, suggesting effects on several demographic parameters including breeding propensity and adult survival. These findings highlight the effects of prey accessibility and fishery removals on seabird populations in marine ecosystems. This will help refine management objectives of marine ecosystems in order to ensure sufficient biomass of forage fish to avoid constraining seabird population dynamics, while taking into account of the effects of environmental variability. © 2017 The Authors","<b>Assessing the Ability of Chloroplast and Nuclear DNA Gene Markers to Verify the Geographic Origin of Jatoba (Hymenaea courbaril L.) Timber<\/b><br><br>Deforestation-reinforced by illegal logging-is a serious problem in many tropical regions and causes pervasive environmental and economic damage. Existing laws that intend to reduce illegal logging need efficient, fraud resistant control methods. We developed a genetic reference database for Jatoba (Hymenaea courbaril), an important, high value timber species from the Neotropics. The data set can be used for controls on declarations of wood origin. Samples from 308 Hymenaea trees from 12 locations in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and French Guiana have been collected and genotyped on 10 nuclear microsatellites (nSSRs), 13 chloroplast SNPs (cpSNP), and 1 chloroplast indel marker. The chloroplast gene markers have been developed using Illumina DNA sequencing. Bayesian cluster analysis divided the individuals based on the nSSRs into 8 genetic groups. Using self-assignment tests, the power of the genetic reference database to judge on declarations on the location has been tested for 3 different assignment methods. We observed a strong genetic differentiation among locations leading to high and reliable self-assignment rates for the locations between 50% to 100% (average of 88%). Although all 3 assignment methods came up with similar mean self-assignment rates, there were differences for some locations linked to the level of genetic diversity, differentiation, and heterozygosity. Our results show that the nuclear and chloroplast gene markers are effective to be used for a genetic certification system and can provide national and international authorities with a robust tool to confirm legality of timber. © 2018 The American Genetic Association.

Estimating the potential epidemiological impact of a product requires thorough understanding of these effects and their interplay at different dosages. Volatile spatial repellent (SR) products come with an additional layer of complexity due to the potential for altered movement of affected mosquitoes and diffusion of volatile particles of the product beyond the treated house. Here, we propose a paired experimental design and statistical inference framework for estimating these nuanced effects of volatile SRs. Method: We fitted a continuous-time Markov chain model in a Bayesian framework to data on marked mosquitoes released in interconnected experimental huts conducted in Iquitos, Peru. We estimated the effects of two dosages of transfluthrin on Ae. aegypti behaviors associated with human-vector contact: repellency, exiting and knockdown in the treated space and in connected, adjacent huts. We validated the framework using simulated data. Results: The odds of a female Ae. aegypti being repelled, and thus prevented from entering a treated hut (H T), increased at both dosages (low dosage: odds = 1.64, 95% highest density interval (HDI) = 1.30-2.09; high dosage: odds = 1.35, HDI = 1.04-1.67). The relative risk of exiting from the treated hut was reduced (low: RR = 0.70, HDI = 0.62-1.09; high: RR = 0.70, HDI = 0.40-1.06), with this effect carrying over to untreated spaces two huts away from the treated hut (H 2) (low: RR = 0.79, HDI = 0.59-1.01; high: RR = 0.66, HDI = 0.50-0.87). Knockdown rates were increased in both treated and downstream huts, particularly under high dosage (H T: RR = 8.37, HDI = 2.11-17.35; H 1: RR = 1.39, HDI = 0.52-2.69; H 2: RR = 2.22, HDI = 0.96-3.86). Conclusions: Our framework is effective at elucidating multiple effects of volatile chemicals used in SR products, as well as their downstream effects. For the examined formulations of transfluthrin, we found notable dose-dependent effects on repellency, movement and knockdown that carry over to adjacent, untreated spaces. © 2018 The Author(s).","<b>Tree genetic resources at risk in South America: A spatial threat assessment to prioritize populations for conservation<\/b><br><br>Background: Humans threat the populations of tree species by overexploitation, deforestation, land use change, and climate change. We present a novel threat assessment at intraspecific level to support the conservation of genetic resources of 80 socioeconomically viable tree species in South America. In this assessment, we evaluate the threat status of Ecogeographic Range Segments (ERSs). ERSs are groups of populations of a specific species in a certain ecological zone of a particular grid cell of a species’ geographic occupancy. Methods: We used species location records to determine the species distributions and species-specific ERSs. We distinguished eight threat situations to assess the risk of extirpation of the ERSs of all 80 species. These threat situations were determined by large or little tree cover, low or high human pressure, and low or high climate change impact. Available layers of tree cover and threats were used to determine the levels of fragmentation and direct human pressure. Maxent niche modelling with two Global Circulation Models helped determining climate change impact by the 2050s. Results: When all 80 species are considered, in total, 59% of the ERSs are threatened by little tree cover or high human pressure. When climate change is also considered, then 71-73% of the ERSs are threatened. When an increased risk of extirpation of populations outside protected areas is considered, then 84–86% of the ERSs are threatened. Seven species warrant special attention because all their ERSs are threatened across their whole distribution in South America: Balfourondendron riedelianum, Cariniana legalis, Dalbergia nigra, Handroanthus pulcherrimus, Pachira quintana, Prosopis flexuosa, and Prosopis pallida. Conclusions: Our results confirm the urgency to set up a regional action plan for the conservation of tree genetic resources in South America. With this threat assessment, we aim to support governments and organizations who are taking up this task. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","<b>Magnolia mercedesiarum (Subsect. talauma, magnoliaceae): A new andean species from northern ecuador, with insights into its potential distribution<\/b><br><br>Magnolia mercedesiarum, a new species from the eastern slopes of the Andes in northern Ecuador, is described and illustrated, and a key to Ecuadorian Magnolia (subsect.

In this work, we propose an estimation method for the DINA model with the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) algorithm, an extension to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method. We conduct a simulation study in order to evaluate the parameter recovery and efficiency of this new Markov chain Monte Carlo method and to compare it with two other Bayesian methods, the Metropolis Hastings and Gibbs sampling algorithms, and with a frequentist method, using the Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm. The results indicated that NUTS algorithm employed in the DINA model properly recovers all parameters and is accurate for all simulated scenarios. We apply this methodology in the mental health area in order to develop a new method of classification for respondents to the Beck Depression Inventory. The implementation of this method for the DINA model applied to other psychological tests has the potential to improve the medical diagnostic process. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Morphological and phylogenetic evidence supports a close relationship between Nectouxia and the Andean genus Salpichroa, but the phylogenetic analyses completed to date have included very few Salpichroa species. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis including Nectouxia and all Salpichroa species was carried out to shed light on the relationship between the two genera. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference analyses were done using sequences from three markers (ITS, psbA-trnH, and ndhF-rpL32). The results of both analyses are congruent regarding the strongly supported clades while incongruences are observed in weakly supported clades that can be explained by rapid species radiation. Salpichroa species are divided in two main clades with strong support, while Nectouxia is resolved within one of them. Our results indicate that the two genera should be combined into a single genus or Salpichroa will be paraphyletic as currently circumscribed. The name Nectouxia has priority but the conservation of Salpichroa has been proposed. At the suprageneric level, the Nectouxia + Salpichroa clade is not closely related to Jaborosa, which is further evidence that the previously recognized tribe Jaboroseae is not monophyletic. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.","<b>Demographic inference and genetic diversity of Octopus mimus (Cephalopoda: Octopodidae) throughout the Humboldt Current System<\/b><br><br>Climatic and oceanographic events occurring during the last glacial cycle in the Humboldt Current System (HCS) have left genetic footprints in marine invertebrate populations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the glacial period on Octopus mimus populations found throughout the HCS. This species lays a large number of small eggs which hatch into planktonic paralarvae with the potential to undergo wide dispersal. We sequenced the COIII gene to perform phylogeographic analyses of 197 octopuses sampled from seven localities. The genetic diversity of Octopus mimus was low and decreased towards the southern end of the distribution range, which comprises a single population. The haplotype genealogy and Bayesian Skyride plot suggest that O. mimus underwent a demographic expansion after the last glacial maximum (LGM). This would imply a contraction of the range of this organism toward northern latitudes during the LGM followed by southward expansion and recolonization once the contemporary interglacial period began. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","<b>Tools for causal inference from cross-sectional innovation surveys with continuous or discrete variables: Theory and applications<\/b><br><br>This paper presents a new statistical toolkit by applying three techniques for data-driven causal inference from the machine learning community that are little- known among economists and innovation scholars: a conditional independencebased approach, additive noise models, and non-algorithmic inference by hand.

The analysis ofthe intraspecific patterns of genetic structure in plants would permit inferring theeffects of Andean uplift on the evolution and diversification of Neotropical flora. Inthis study, using microsatellite markers and Bayesian clustering analyses, we reportthe presence of four genetic clusters for the palm Oenocarpus bataua var. batauawhich are located within four biogeographic regions in northwestern South America:(a) Chocó rain forest, (b) Amotape-Huancabamba Zone, (c) northwestern Amazonianrain forest, and (d) southwestern Amazonian rain forest. We hypothesize that theseclusters developed following three genetic diversification events mainly promoted byAndean orogenic events. Additionally, the distinct current climate dynamics amongnorthwestern and southwestern Amazonia may maintain the genetic diversificationdetected in the western Amazon basin. Genetic exchange was identified betweenthe clusters, including across the Andes region, discarding the possibility of any cluster to diversify as a distinct intraspecific variety. We identified a hot spot of geneticdiversity in the northern Peruvian Amazon around the locality of Iquitos. We alsodetected a decrease in diversity with distance from this area in westward and southward direction within the Amazon basin and the eastern Andean foothills. Additionally,we confirmed the existence and divergence of O. bataua var. bataua from var. oligocarpus in northern South America, possibly expanding the distributional range of thelatter variety beyond eastern Venezuela, to the central and eastern Andean cordilleras of Colombia.

Two hundred and fifty accessions, representing paired samples consisting of original mother plants and their in vitro counterparts from the cultivated potato collection at the International Potato Center (CIP) were fingerprinted using the Infinium 12K V2 Potato Array to confirm genetic identity of the accessions and evaluate genetic diversity of the potato collection. Diploid, triploid, and tetraploid accessions were included, representing seven cultivated potato taxa (based on Hawkes, 1990). Fingerprints between voucher mother plants maintained in the field and in vitro clones of the same accession were used to evaluate identity, relatedness, and ancestry using hierarchal clustering and model-based Bayesian admixture analyses. Generally, in vitro and field clones of the same accession grouped together; however, 11 (4.4%) accessions were mismatches genetically, and in some cases the SNP data revealed the identity of the mixed accession. SNP genotypes were used to assess genetic diversity and to evaluate inter- and intraspecific relationships along with determining population structure and hybrid origins. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the triploids included in this study are genetically similar. Further, some genetic redundancies among individual accessions were also identified along with some putative misclassified accessions. Accessions generally clustered together based on taxonomic classification and ploidy level with some deviations. STRUCTURE analysis identified six populations with significant gene flow among the populations, as well as revealed hybrid taxa and accessions. Overall, the Infinium 12K V2 Potato Array proved useful in confirming identity and highlighting the diversity in this subset of the CIP collection, providing new insights into the accessions evaluated. This study provides a model for genetic identity of plant genetic resources collections as mistakes in conservation of these collections and in genebanks is a reality. For breeders and other users of these collections, confirmed identity is critical, as well as for quality management programs and to provide insights into the accessions evaluated. © 2018 Canadian Science Publishing.

To better understand the transmission dynamics of P. vivax populations in the PNC and the neighboring Ecuadorian Amazon Basin (EAB), we studied the genetic variability and population structure of P. vivax in these areas. One hundred and twenty P. vivax isolates (58 from Piura and 37 from Tumbes in thePNCcollected from 2008 to 2010 and 25 from theEAB collected in Pastaza from 2001 to 2004) were assessed by five polymorphic microsatellite markers. Genetic variability was determined by expected heterozygosity (He) and population structure by Bayesian inference cluster analysis.Wefound very low genetic diversity in the PNC (He = 0-0.32) but high genetic diversity in the EAB (He = 0.43-0.70). Population structure analysis revealed three distinct populations in the three locations. Six of 37 (16%) isolates from Tumbes had an identical haplotype to that found in Piura, suggesting unidirectional flow from Piura to Tumbes. In addition, one haplotype from Tumbes showed similarity to a haplotype found in Pastaza, suggesting that this could be an imported case from EAB. These findings strongly suggest a minimal population flow and different levels of genetic variability between these two areas divided by the Andes Mountains. This work presents molecular markers that could be used to increase our understanding of regional malaria transmission dynamics, which has implications for the development of strategies for P. vivax control.

The present study aims to provide basic information regarding the isotopic niche and trophic interactions of four pelagic elasmobranchs of commercial importance in northern Peru (Alopias spp., Galeorhinus galeus, Sphyrna zygaena, and Mobula japanica). One hundred and twenty-four samples were collected from fishing activities between January and December 2015 and processed for stable isotopes analysis (δ13C and δ15N), using Bayesian statistics to describe their isotopic niche. Differences between species were assessed using PERMANOVA and PERMDISP, allowing testing length, sex, and latitude as covariates. These combined results suggest trophic redundancy among sharks. However, unique areas of no overlap in the SEAC of all species could evidence a broad niche with a low interaction between these sharks. M. japanica had no overlap with any shark species, which indicates a trophic niche that is distinct from other elasmobranch top predators. Increasing sample size and including temporal covariates should help define these isotopic niches better, either by merging or splitting the studied elasmobranchs into more specific groupings. Further complementary studies are required to better understand trophic interactions within the pelagic community ecosystems. © 2018, Escuela de Ciencias del Mar.

Bayesian clustering and genetic distance-based methods were used based on nine microsatellite loci in 377 individuals of three main putative species of the complex. The resulting genetic clusters were assessed for ecological niche divergence and areolar morphology, particularly spination patterns. We based our species boundaries on concordance between genetic, ecological, and morphological data, and were able to resolve four species, three of them corresponding to S. pruinosus from central Mexico, S. laevigatus from southern Mexico, and S. griseus from northern South America. A fourth species, previously considered to be S. griseus and commonly misidentified as S. pruinosus in northern Mexico showed significant genetic, ecological, and morphological differentiation suggesting that it should be considered a new species, S. huastecorum, which we describe here. We show that population genetic analyses, ecological niche modeling, and morphological studies are complementary approaches for delimiting species in taxonomically challenging plant groups such as the SGSC. © 2018 Alvarado-Sizzo et al.

Further, two sets of high-frequency data are also used. The model is a parametric state-space model with an estimation framework that combines long memory and level shifts by decomposing the underlying process into a mixture model and ARFIMA dynamics. The results of the estimates are not conclusive as those obtained in Varneskov and Perron (2017a,b). In fact, the very small magnitudes of the fractional parameter estimates suggest that only the high-frequency series could be modeled as RLS-ARFIMA models. The other (daily) series would be modeled as RLS-ARMA models with measurement errors except in the case of the Forex market of Brazil where there is no evidence of measurement errors. Another possibility is to accept the small magnitudes of the estimates of the fractional parameter as evidence of genuine long memory and, in that case, a larger group of series can be modeled as RLS-ARFIMA models. The forecasts are evaluated from two perspectives: one using 10% of the Model Confidence Set of Hansen, Lunde, and Nason (2011) and the other using a recent statistic proposed by Knüppel (2015) to evaluate density forecasts. The results favor the RLS-ARMA and RLS-ARFIMA models although we found some differences between the two approaches for the cases of Brazil and Mexico (stocks) and Argentina (Forex). Finally, forecasts are used to calculate the VaR at 1%, 5% and 10%. The results support broadly the RLS-ARFIMA models with one or two exceptions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Modeling Raccoon (Procyon lotor) Habitat Connectivity to Identify Potential Corridors for Rabies Spread<\/b><br><br>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Wildlife Services National Rabies Management Program has conducted cooperative oral rabies vaccination (ORV) programs since 1997. Understanding the eco-epidemiology of raccoon (Procyon lotor) variant rabies (raccoon rabies) is critical to successful management. Pine (Pinus spp.)-dominated landscapes generally support low relative raccoon densities that may inhibit rabies spread. However, confounding landscape features, such as wetlands and human development, represent potentially elevated risk corridors for rabies spread, possibly imperiling enhanced rabies surveillance and ORV planning. Raccoon habitat suitability in pine-dominated landscapes in Massachusetts, Florida, and Alabama was modeled by the maximum entropy (Maxent) procedure using raccoon presence, and landscape and environmental data. Replicated (n = 100/state) bootstrapped Maxent models based on raccoon sampling locations from 2012–2014 indicated that soil type was the most influential variable in Alabama (permutation importance PI = 38.3), which, based on its relation to landcover type and resource distribution and abundance, was unsurprising. Precipitation (PI = 46.9) and temperature (PI = 52.1) were the most important variables in Massachusetts and Florida, but these possibly spurious results require further investigation. The Alabama Maxent probability surface map was ingested into Circuitscape for conductance visualizations of potential areas of habitat connectivity. Incorporating these and future results into raccoon rabies containment and elimination strategies could result in significant cost-savings for rabies management here and elsewhere. © 2017 by the authors.","<b>Bayesian estimation for a mixture of simplex distributions with an unknown number of components: HDI analysis in Brazil<\/b><br><br>Variables taking value in (0, 1), such as rates or proportions, are frequently analyzed by researchers, for instance, political and social data, as well as the Human Development Index (HDI). However, sometimes this type of data cannot be modeled adequately using a unique distribution. In this case, we can use a mixture of distributions, which is a powerful and flexible probabilistic tool. This manuscript deals with a mixture of simplex distributions to model proportional data. A fully Bayesian approach is proposed for inference which includes a reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure. The usefulness of the proposed approach is confirmed by using of the simulated mixture data from several different scenarios and by using the methodology to analyze municipal HDI data of cities (or towns) in the Northeast region and São Paulo state in Brazil. The analysis shows that among the cities in the Northeast, some appear to have a similar HDI to other cities in São Paulo state. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","<b>High genetic connectivity and Population Expansion of Scomber japonicus in the Northern Humboldt Current System revealed by mitochondrial control region sequences<\/b><br><br>The chub mackerel, Scomber japonicus supports an important fshery in the Southeast Pacifc, however, its population genetics is currently unknown. In the present study, we examined the genetic structure, the gene flow and the historical demography of this species in the Northern Humboldt Current System. Samples were collected during summer of years 2013-2014 from three fshing points (Paita, Ventanilla and Ilo), covering 12 degrees of latitude along the coast of Peru. A 532 bp segment of the mitochondrial control region was sequenced in 72 individuals, which allowed us to detect a total of 29 polymorphic sites, 35 haplotypes, moderate-to-high levels of haplotype diversity (0.793-0.969) and very low levels of nucleotide diversity (0.004-0.008). Gene flow analysis showed high levels of connectivity among populations in the sampling areas. Analysis of molecular variance (·ST = 0.00868, P = 0.1837), population pairwise ·ST comparisons and genetic diflerentiation tests confrmed the lack of genetic structuring among the three localities. These analyses suggest that sampling sites analyzed can be considered as a single gene pool. Migratory behavior, the high dispersal potential of early stages and the lack of oceanographic barriers may explain its genetic homogeneity along the Peruvian sea. Historical demography was also examined. Neutrality tests, mismatch distribution and Bayesian skyline plot suggested a population expansion scenario that took place during the Late Pleistocene.

We sampled nine taxa covering the whole geographical range of the group. Two mitochondrial and two nuclear genes were analysed using a Bayesian method. We established a dated phylogeny of the group using a relaxed clock method and a wide-outgroup approach. To discriminate between two hypotheses, we used a biogeographical probabilistic method. Results suggest that the ancestor of the M. sulkowskyi group originated during the Middle–Late Miocene uplift of the Eastern Cordillera in northern Peru. Biogeographical inference suggests that the M. sulkowskyi and Morpho lympharis clades diverged in the northern Peruvian Andes. The subsequent divergences, from the Late Miocene to the Late Pliocene, should have resulted from a dispersal towards the Northern Andes (M. sulkowskyi clade), after the closure of the West Andean Portal separating the Central and Northern Andes, and a southwards dispersal along the Peruvian and Bolivian Eastern Cordilleras (M. lympharis clade). Only a few divergences occurred at the very end of the Pliocene or during the Pleistocene, a period when the more recent uplifts interfered with Pleistocene glacial cycles. © 2016 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences","<b>Modeled shifts in Polylepis species ranges in the Andes from the last glacial maximum to the present<\/b><br><br>Polylepis woodlands, the dominant high-elevation woodland species of the Andes of South America, are an increasingly important focus of conservation and restoration efforts as a buffer to the regional effects of climate change. However, the natural extent of these woodlands before the arrival of human populations is still debated. One significant approach to this question is an assessment of the change in woodland extent from a hypothetical peak at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present where distributions have been altered by both Holocene climate oscillations and anthropogenic pressures of pre-Colombian and modern communities. LGM and present distributions for 21 Polylepis species were modeled using Maxent with environmental data obtained from the WorldClim database. Overall, potential woodland extent is 36% smaller today than at LGM, however a few species have experienced a projected increase in potential range of 180%. This has occurred at the interface of the southern Amazonian Basin with the Altiplano where Polylepis species richness is highest. Bioclimatically stable areas for each species averaged 20 ± 4% of the modeled range and mostly occurred in disjunct pockets from central Peru to northern Argentina and Chile. © 2017 by the authors.","<b>Ancient female philopatry, asymmetric male gene flow, and synchronous population expansion support the influence of climatic oscillations on the evolution of South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens)<\/b><br><br>The South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) is widely distributed along the southern Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America with a history of significant commercial exploitation. We aimed to evaluate the population genetic structure and the evolutionary history of South American sea lion along its distribution by analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and 10 nuclear microsatellites loci. We analyzed 147 sequences of mtDNA control region and genotyped 111 individuals of South American sea lion for 10 microsatellite loci, representing six populations (Peru, Northern Chile, Southern Chile, Uruguay (Brazil), Argentina and Falkland (Malvinas) Islands) and covering the entire distribution of the species. The mtDNA phylogeny shows that haplotypes from the two oceans comprise two very divergent clades as observed in previous studies, suggesting a long period (>1 million years) of low inter-oceanic female gene flow. Bayesian analysis of bi-parental genetic diversity supports significant (but less pronounced than mitochondrial) genetic structure between Pacific and Atlantic populations, although also suggested some inter-oceanic gene flow mediated by males. Higher male migration rates were found in the intra-oceanic population comparisons, supporting very high female philopatry in the species. Demographic analyses showed that populations from both oceans went through a large population expansion ∼10,000 years ago, suggesting a very similar influence of historical environmental factors, such as the last glacial cycle, on both regions. Our results support the proposition that the Pacific and Atlantic populations of the South American sea lion should be considered distinct evolutionarily significant units, with at least two managements units in each ocean. © 2017 Oliveira et al.

However, the discrimination capabilities of these features for ABSC could be enhanced by accounting for the vocal production mechanisms of birds, and, in particular, the spectro-temporal structure of bird sounds. In this paper, a new front-end for ABSC is proposed that incorporates this specific information through the non-negative decomposition of bird sound spectrograms. It consists of the following two different stages: short-time feature extraction and temporal feature integration. In the first stage, which aims at providing a better spectral representation of bird sounds on a frame-by-frame basis, two methods are evaluated. In the first method, cepstral-like features (NMF_CC) are extracted by using a filter bank that is automatically learned by means of the application of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on bird audio spectrograms. In the second method, the features are directly derived from the activation coefficients of the spectrogram decomposition as performed through NMF (H_CC). The second stage summarizes the most relevant information contained in the short-time features by computing several statistical measures over long segments. The experiments show that the use of NMF_CC and H_CC in conjunction with temporal integration significantly improves the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based ABSC system with respect to conventional MFCC. © 2017 Ludeña-Choez et al.

The eight currently recognized species occur in the lowlands of South and Central America. Based on the largest taxon and character sampling to date, we analyze three mitochondrial and one nuclear gene using Bayesian methods to (1) infer the phylogeny of Polychrus under both concatenated-tree and speciestree methods; (2) identify lineages that could represent putative undescribed species; and (3) estimate divergence times. Our species tree places P. acutirostris as the sister taxon to all other species of Polychrus. While the phylogenetic position of P. gutturosus and P. peruvianus is poorly resolved, P. marmoratus and P. femoralis are strongly supported as sister to P. liogaster and P. jacquelinae, respectively. Recognition of P. auduboni and P. marmoratus sensu stricto as distinct species indicates that the populations of \"P. marmoratus\" from the Amazon and the Atlantic coast in Brazil represent separate species. Similarly, populations of P. femoralis from the Tumbes region might belong to a cryptic undescribed species. Relative divergence times and published age estimates suggest that the orogeny of the Andes did not play a significant role in the early evolution of Polychrus. © 2017 Torres-Carvajal et al.

Interestingly, this mechanism is necessary for the viability of some tumor cells. Unfortunately, its molecular underpinnings are not yet completely understood. Objective: Here, we combine carefully designed non-targeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics experiments with a bioinformatics approach to characterize the ALT positive phenotype observed in yeast at the metabolomics level. Methods: We profiled the metabolome using mass spectrometry in yeast strains that have lost telomerase expression, as well as that in pre-senescence and the rescued states. To dissect unwanted technical variation from biologically relevant variation between these states, we used a two-step normalization strategy, i.e., first, an empirical Bayesian framework; and next, we corrected for second-order technical effects. Results: Our results show that ALT-positive yeast strains present two different types of metabolic responses to the genetically-induced telomerase dysfunction: (i) systemic and (ii) specific. The key-difference between these responses is that the systemic response lasts even after the yeast strains have been genetically rescued, while the specific response does not. Interestingly, these metabolic changes can be associated with generic stress responses (e.g., DNA damage) as well as specific responses like accelerated aging of early telomerase-inactivation. Conclusions: A mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach reveals two distinct types of metabolomics response to telomerase dysfunction in yeast. By identifying these changes in protein (e.g., ARG7, and ARG1), and metabolite (e.g., dATP, and dDTP) amounts, we complement the available information on ALT at the genome-wide level. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","<b>Demirjian's stages and Cameriere's third molar maturity index to estimate legal adult age in Peruvian population<\/b><br><br>Objective To compare the accuracy of Demirjian's stages (DS) and Cameriere's third molar maturity index cut-off value (I3M < 0.08) to estimate the age of majority on panoramic radiographs (OPTs) from the dental clinic of the Scientific University of the South (UCSUR), Lima, Peru. Methods An observational cross-sectional study was conducted on the sample of 208 digital panoramic radiographs of patients aged 14–22 years examined during 2015 in UCSUR. The left lower third molars were analyzed using Adobe Photoshop® CS6. An effectiveness of specific DS and I3M < 0.08 was evaluated by using accurate classification, sensitivity, specificity, positive (LR+) and negative (LR−) likelihood ratios and Bayes post-test probability (p). Results Only G and H stages were practical for classify adults and minors in the tested sample, while I3M < 0.08 showed the best performance in both sexes. For I3M < 0.08, the accurate classification, sensitivity and specificity were 0.96, 0.96, 0.96 and 0.90, 0.84 and 0.95 in males and females, respectively. Values of LR+, LR− and p were 24.96, 0.04, 0.97 and 15.68, 0.17, 0.95 in males and females, respectively. Conclusion The specific cut-off value of third molar maturity index (I3M < 0.08) showed to be more accurate in discriminating adults and minors in Peruvian sample when a test with high sensitivity and specificity is required. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","<b>A new genus of Anostomidae (Ostariophysi: Characiformes): Diversity, phylogeny and biogeography based on cytogenetic, molecular and morphological data<\/b><br><br>A new genus of Anostomidae (Characiformes) is described to include ten valid extant species previously classified in Leporinus or Hypomasticus and distributed throughout most major river basins in South America: L. brinco, L. conirostris, L. elongatus, H. garmani, L. macrocephalus, L. muyscorum, L. obtusidens, L. piavussu, L. reinhardti, and L. trifasciatus. The monophyly of Megaleporinus is well-supported in a phylogenetic analysis based on two mitochondrial and three nuclear genes, as well as its sister group relationship to Abramites. Megaleporinus is diagnosed by having the exclusive combination of three unicuspid teeth on each premaxillary and dentary bone and a color pattern composed of one to four dark midlateral blotches. Additional distinguishing features and possible synapomorphies include a unique ZZ/ZW sex chromosome system confirmed for six congeners and a drumming apparatus wherein the first rib is elongated and associated with hypertrophied intercostal muscles, which was confirmed for three congeners as exclusive to mature males. Furthermore, our study identified at least four undescribed cryptic species, emphasizing the need for further taxonomic work and genetic analyses. A time-calibrated phylogenetic and biogeographical analysis of the new genus suggests that speciation in the proto-Amazon-Orinoco lineage was primarily driven by paleogeographic processes, such as the formation of the Orinoco and Tocantins basins. Dispersal and diversification of the genus in coastal basins draining the Eastern Brazilian Shield appears to have been facilitated by connections between paleo-basins during low sea level periods and headwater captures between coastal and inland watersheds. The present contribution demonstrates the importance of integrating data from morphology, DNA sequences and cytogenetics to advance the taxonomy and systematics of any complex species group. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Modelling the volatility of commodities prices using a stochastic volatility model with random level shifts<\/b><br><br>We use the approach of Qu and Perron (Econom J 16(3):309–339, 2013) for the modeling and inference of volatility of a set of commodity prices in the presence of random level shifts of unknown timing, magnitude and frequency. Our approach contributes to the study of commodities in several aspects. First, we test for the presence of a genuine long-memory process in the volatility of commodities. Second, we determine that the random level shifts are certainly the main source of variation in the commodity price volatility. Finally, we estimate the volatility and its components as latent variables, thereby making it possible to evaluate their level of correlation with macroeconomic variables in small open economies such as Latin-American countries where the dependence on commodity price volatility is high. We use six commodity series: agriculture, livestock, gold, oil, industrial metals and a general commodity index. All series cover the period from January 1983 until December 2013 in daily frequency. The results show that although the occurrence of a level shift is rare, (about once every 1.5 or 1.8 years), this component clearly contributes most to the variation in the volatility. Furthermore, isolating the level shift component from the overall volatility indicates a strong relationship of this component with a set of business cycle indicators of several Latin American countries. © 2016, Kiel Institute.","<b>A quantile parametric mixed regression model for bounded response variables<\/b><br><br>Bounded response variables are common in many applications where the responses are percentages, proportions, or rates. New regression models have been proposed recently to model the relationship among one or more covariates and the conditional mean of a response variable based on the beta distribution or a mixture of beta distributions. However, when we are interested in knowing how covariates impact different levels of the response variable, quantile regression models play an important role. A new quantile parametric mixed regression model for bounded response variables is presented by considering the distribution introduced by [27]. A Bayesian approach is adopted for inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Model comparison criteria are also discussed. The inferential methods can be easily programmed and then easily used for data modeling. Results from a simulation study are reported showing the good performance of the proposed inferential methods. Furthermore, results from data analyses using regression models with fixed and mixed effects are given. Specifically, we show that the quantile parametric model proposed here is an alternative and complementary modeling tool for bounded response variables such as the poverty index in Brazilian municipalities, which is linked to the Gini coefficient and the human development index.","<b>Power and reversal power links for binary regressions: An application for motor insurance policyholders<\/b><br><br>In binary regression, symmetric links such as logit and probit are usually considered as standard. However, in the presence of unbalancing of ones and zeros, these links can be inappropriate and inflexible to fit the skewness in the response curve and likely to lead to misspecification. This is the case of covering some type of insurance, where it can be observed that the probability of a given binary response variable approaches zero at different rates than it approaches one. Furthermore, when usual links are considered, there is not a skewness parameter associated with the distribution chosen that, regardless of the linear predictor, is easily interpreted. In order to overcome such problems, a proposal for the construction of a set of new skew links is developed in this paper, where some of their properties are discussed. In this context, power links and their reversal versions are presented. A Bayesian inference approach using MCMC is developed for the presented models. The methodology is illustrated considering a sample of motor insurance policyholders selected randomly by gender. Results suggest that the proposed link functions are more appropriate than other alternative link functions commonly used in the literature. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Here, we contrast host and virus genetic signatures to resolve the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying geographic expansions of vampire bat rabies virus (VBRV) in Peru. Phylogenetic analysis revealed recent viral spread between populations that, according to extreme geographic structure in maternally inherited host mitochondrial DNA, appeared completely isolated. In contrast, greater population connectivity in biparentally inherited nuclear microsatellites explained the historical limits of invasions, suggesting that dispersing male bats spread VBRV between genetically isolated female populations. Host nuclear DNA further indicated unanticipated gene flow through the Andes mountains connecting the VBRV-free Pacific coast to the VBRV-endemic Amazon rainforest. By combining Bayesian phylogeography with landscape resistance models, we projected invasion routes through northern Peru that were validated by real-time livestock rabies mortality data. The first outbreaks of VBRV on the Pacific coast of South America could occur by June 2020, which would have serious implications for agriculture, wildlife conservation, and human health. Our results show that combining host and pathogen genetic data can identify sex biases in pathogen spatial spread, which may be a widespread but underappreciated phenomenon, and demonstrate that genetic forecasting can aid preparedness for impending viral invasions.","<b>Simulation of the energy efficiency auction prices in Brazil<\/b><br><br>The electricity consumption behavior in Brazil has been extensively investigated over the years due to financial and social problems.

In Peru, the Marañón dry forest, an ecoregion with little biological and ecological research, is the habitat of the species. Unfortunately, at the present time, it is being affected by agriculture, livestock and road construction, and soon will be threatened by the implementation of large scale economic activities, such as hydroelectric stations. In order to identify priority sectors for research and conservation of the Andean bear in the Marañón dry forest of Cajamarca and Amazonas regions, its habitat was modeled using MaxEnt algorithm. Sixty records of its presence as well as 6 environmental and climatic variables were used. Considering a total extension of 6,501.2 km2 of Marañón dry forest, the suitable existing habitat for the Andean bear would be only 480.7 km2 (7.4%) and the marginal existing habitat, 2,418.5 km2 (37.2%).

Phylogenetic tree analyses (maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian species tree) indicate Leporinus to be paraphyletic, with monophyly being rejected by both Kishino-Hasegawa and Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests. The sequenced species of Leporinus are distributed across five clades that are interleaved among other anostomid genera. Several taxonomic changes are suggested as being necessary to restore monophyly for the group. The clade containing the type species, Leporinus fasciatus, should be considered Leporinus sensu stricto and at least three new genera should be described for other species currently considered part of Leporinus. © 2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.","<b>Mimetic divergence and the speciation continuum in the mimic poison frog ranitomeya imitator<\/b><br><br>While divergent ecological adaptation can drive speciation, understanding the factors that facilitate or constrain this process remains a major goal in speciation research. Here, we study two mimetic transition zones in the poison frog Ranitomeya imitator, a species that has undergone a Müllerian mimetic radiation to establish four morphs in Peru. We find that mimetic morphs are strongly phenotypically differentiated, producing geographic clines with varying widths. However, distinct morphs show little neutral genetic divergence, and landscape genetic analyses implicate isolation by distance as the primary determinant of among-population genetic differentiation. Mate choice experiments suggest random mating at the transition zones, although certain allopatric populations show a preference for their own morph. We present evidence that this preference may be mediated by color pattern specifically. These results contrast with an earlier study of a third transition zone, in which a mimetic shift was associated with reproductive isolation. Overall, our results suggest that the three known mimetic transition zones in R. imitator reflect a speciation continuum, which we have characterized at the geographic, phenotypic, behavioral, and genetic levels. We discuss possible explanations for variable progress toward speciation, suggesting that multifarious selection on both mimetic color pattern and body size may be responsible for generating reproductive isolation. © 2015 by The University of Chicago.

Despite considerable efforts for its control, vivax malaria remains a major health problem in Peru. In this study, we have explored the population genetics of Plasmodium vivax isolates from Iquitos, the main city in the Peruvian Amazon, and 25 neighbouring peri-urban as well as rural villages along the Iquitos-Nauta Road. Methodology/ Results: From April to December 2008, 292 P. vivax isolates were collected and successfully genotyped using 14 neutral microsatellites. Analysis of the molecular data revealed a similar proportion of monoclonal and polyclonal infections in urban areas, while in rural areas monoclonal infections were predominant (p = 0.002). Multiplicity of infection was higher in urban (MOI = 1.5–2) compared to rural areas (MOI = 1) (p = 0.003). The level of genetic diversity was similar in all areas (He = 0.66–0.76, p = 0.32) though genetic differentiation between areas was substantial (PHIPT = 0.17, p<0.0001). Principal coordinate analysis showed a marked differentiation between parasites from urban and rural areas. Linkage disequilibrium was detected in all the areas ((Formula presented.) = 0.08–0.49, for all p<0.0001). Gene flow among the areas was stablished through Bayesian analysis of migration models. Recent bottleneck events were detected in 4 areas and a recent parasite expansion in one of the isolated areas. In total, 87 unique haplotypes grouped in 2 or 3 genetic clusters described a sub-structured parasite population. Conclusion/Significance: Our study shows a sub-structured parasite population with clonal propagation, with most of its components recently affected by bottleneck events. Iquitos city is the main source of parasite spreading for all the peripheral study areas. The routes of transmission and gene flow and the reduction of the parasite population described are important from the public health perspective as well for the formulation of future control policies. © 2016 Delgado-Ratto et al.","<b>Tobacco consumption and positive mental health: An epidemiological study from a positive psychology perspective<\/b><br><br>Background: Positive mental health (PMH) is much more than the absence of mental illnesses. For example, PMH explains that to be happy or resilient can drive us to live a full life, giving us a perception of well-being and robustness against everyday problems. Moreover, PMH can help people to avoid risky behaviours like tobacco consumption (TC). Our hypothesis was that PMH is negatively associated with TC, and this association differs across rural, urban and migrant populations. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using the PERU MIGRANT Study's dataset, including rural population from the Peruvian highlands (n = 201), urban population from the capital city Lima (n = 199) and migrants who were born in highlands but had to migrated because of terrorism (n = 589). We used an adapted version of the 12-item Global Health Questionnaire to measure PMH. The outcome was TC, measured as lifetime and recent TC. Log-Poisson robust regression, performed with a Maximum Likelihood method, was used to estimate crude prevalence ratios (PR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95%CI), adjusted by sex, age, family income and education which were the confounders. The modelling procedure included the use of LR Test, Akaike information criteria (AIC) and Bayesian information criteria (BIC). Results: Cumulative occurrence of tobacco use (lifetime TC) was 61.7 % in the rural group, 78 % in the urban group and 76.2 % in rural-to-urban migrants. Recent TC was 35.3 % in the rural group, 30.7 % in the urban group and 20.5 % in rural-to-urban migrants. After adjusting for confounders, there was evidence of a negative association between PMH and lifetime TC in the rural group (PR = 0.93; 95%CI: 0.87-0.99), and a positive association between PMH and recent TC in migrants (PR = 1.1; 95%CI: 1.0-1.3). Conclusions: PMH was negatively associated with TC in rural participants only. Urbans exhibited just a similar trend, while migrants exhibited the opposite one. This evidence represents the first step in the route of knowing the potential of PMH for fighting against TC. For rural populations, this study supplies new information that could support decisions about prevention programmes and psychotherapy for smoking cessation. However, more research in the topic is needed. © 2016 Bazo-Alvarez et al.","<b>Phylogeny, species delimitation and convergence in the South American bothriurid scorpion genus Brachistosternus Pocock 1893: Integrating morphology, nuclear and mitochondrial DNA<\/b><br><br>A phylogenetic analysis of the scorpion genus Brachistosternus Pocock, 1893 (Bothriuridae Simon, 1880) is presented, based on a dataset including 41 of the 43 described species and five outgroups, 116 morphological characters and more than 4150 base-pairs of DNA sequence from the nuclear 18S rDNA and 28S rDNA gene loci, and the mitochondrial 12S rDNA, 16S rDNA, and Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit I gene loci. Analyses conducted using parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference were largely congruent with high support for most clades. The results confirmed the monophyly of Brachistosternus, the nominal subgenus, and subgenus Ministernus Francke, 1985, as in previous analyses based only on morphology, but differed in several other respects. Species from the plains of the Atacama Desert diverged basally whereas the high altitude Andean species radiated from a more derived ancestor, presumably as a consequence of Andean uplift and associated changes in climate. Species limits were assessed among species that contain intraspecific variation (e.g., different morphs), are difficult to separate morphologically, and/or exhibit widespread or disjunct distributions. The extent of convergence in morphological adaptation to life on sandy substrata (psammophily) and the complexity of the male genitalia, or hemispermatophores, was investigated. Psammophily evolved on at least four independent occasions. The lobe regions of the hemispermatophore increased in complexity on three independent occasions, and decreased in complexity on another three independent occasions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Phylogeny of Neotropical Cercosaura (Squamata: Gymnophthalmidae) lizards<\/b><br><br>Among Neotropical lizards, the geographically widespread gymnophthalmid Cercosaura as currently defined includes lowland and highland taxa from Panama to Argentina, with some species occurring in the northern Andes. In this study we analyze three mitochondrial (12S, 16S, ND4) and one nuclear (c-mos) gene using Bayesian methods to clarify the phylogenetic relationships among most species of Cercosaura based on a well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis that also includes a large sample of other taxa within Cercosaurini. The phylogenetic tree obtained in this paper shows that Cercosaura as currently defined is not monophyletic. Two species from the northern Andes (C. dicra and C. vertebralis) are nested within Pholidobolus, which has been formerly recognized as a major radiation along the Andes of Ecuador and Colombia. Therefore, Cercosaura has probably not diversified in the northern Andes, although the phylogenetic position of C. hypnoides from the Andes of Colombia remains unknown. Tree topology and genetic distances support both recognition of C. ocellata bassleri as a distinct species, C. bassleri, and recognition of C. argula and C. oshaughnessyi as two different species. In the interest of promoting clarity and precision regarding the names of clades of gymnophthalmid lizards, we propose a phylogenetic definition of Cercosaura. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","<b>DNA barcode and evolutionary relationship within Laemolyta Cope 1872 (Characiformes: Anostomidae) through molecular analyses<\/b><br><br>The Laemolyta genus is a monophyletic group with five valid species. Phylogenetic relationships among the species of this genus are unknown. We analyzed four nominal Laemolyta species. The COI gene for all individuals was amplified and the genetic distances were estimated. We performed genetic distance analyses to determine the different MOTUs. Two mitochondrial (COI and CytB) and three nuclear (Myh6, RAG1 and RAG2) markers were amplified for one individual of each identified MOTU. Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood were conducted using concatenate alignment. In addition, multilocus Bayesian species tree was carried out. By using DNA barcode, we identified six different MOTUs. The COI inter-MOTU distances ranged from 0.92% to 5.76%. The normalized mean intra-MOTU distance was 0.13%. The DNA barcode was useful to diagnose all species. Two clades showing distinct color patterns were recovered in all molecular phylogenetic trees. Clade A joined fishes with no vertical bars (L. garmani, L. taeniata 1 and L. taeniata 2) and clade B, fishes with vertical dark bars (L. fernandezi Araguaia, L. fernandezi Xingu, and L. proxima).

Few methods create a rigorous underlying model for the antibody levels of populations consisting of a mixture of positive and negative subjects, and fewer make full use of the entirety of the available data for diagnoses. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that provides a systematic way of pooling data across different plates, and accounts for the subtle sources of variations that occur in the optical densities of typical microtiter data. In addition to our Bayesian method having good frequentist properties, we find that our method outperforms one of the standard crude approaches (the “3 SD Rule”) under reasonable assumptions, and provides more accurate disease diagnoses in terms of both sensitivity and specificity. © 2014, International Chinese Statistical Association.","<b>A Multilocus Molecular Phylogeny for Chaetostoma Clade Genera and Species with a Review of Chaetostoma (Siluriformes: Loricariidae) from the Central Andes<\/b><br><br>The rubbernose-pleco genus Chaetostoma comprises 47 currently valid and many undescribed species distributed along Atlantic and Pacific slopes of the Andes Mountains from Panama to southern Peru, the Coastal Mountains of Venezuela, and drainages of the Guiana and Brazilian shields. We present a five-locus molecular phylogeny for 21 described and six undescribed species of Chaetostoma spanning the geographic range of the genus. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses found Chaetostoma to be well supported as monophyletic and sister to a clade of central and northern Andean genera that have also been hypothesized to be closely related based on morphology (i.e., Andeancistrus, Cordylancistrus, Dolichancistrus, Leptoancistrus, and Transancistrus). Species of Chaetostoma were divided into a trichotomy consisting of: a Pacific Coast, Central American, Magdalena Basin, Lake Valencia, and Guiana Shield clade a western Orinoco, Lake Maracaibo, and Lake Valencia clade and a widespread upper Amazon/Orinoco clade inclusive of a single species on the Brazilian Shield. We also conducted a systematic review of species from the central Andes of northern Peru and Ecuador. Based on our phylogenetic results and direct examination of historical and recently collected type and non-type material, we describe two new species of Chaetostoma (C. bifurcum, from the Pacific Coast, and C. trimaculineum, from the Atlantic Slope), redescribe four species (C. breve, C. carrioni, C. dermorhynchum, and C. microps, all from the Atlantic Slope), transfer four species from Chaetostoma to Ancistrus and find two species to be junior synonyms. © 2015 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.","<b>Robustness and accuracy of Maxent niche modelling for Lactuca species distributions in light of collecting expeditions<\/b><br><br>Niche modelling software can be used to assess the probability of detecting a population of a plant species at a certain location. In this study, we used the distribution of the wild relatives of lettuce (Lactuca spp.) to investigate the applicability of Maxent species distribution models for collecting missions. Geographic origin data of genebank and herbarium specimens and climatic data of the origin locations were used as input. For Lactuca saligna, we varied the input data by omitting the specimens from different parts of the known distribution area to assess the robustness of the predicted distributions. Furthermore, we examined the accuracy of the modelling by comparing the predicted probabilities of population presence against recent expedition data for the endemic Lactuca georgica and the cosmopolitan Lactuca serriola. We found Maxent to be quite robust in its predictions, although its usefulness was higher for endemic taxa than for more widespread species. The exclusion of occurrence data from the perceived range margins of the species can result in important information about local adaptation to distinct climatic conditions. We discuss the potential for enhanced use of Maxent in germplasm collecting planning. © NIAB 2014.","<b>Spatial distribution of genetic variation of Stenocereus pruinosus (Otto) Buxb. in Mexico: analysing evidence on the origins of its domestication<\/b><br><br>We studied populations of Stenocereus pruinosus throughout Mexico, a species important for its edible fruit. The Tehuacán Valley is setting of ancient and the currently most active management of S. pruinosus; we hypothesized Tehuacán as the original area of domestication of S. pruinosus and expected to find there its highest genetic variation and original source of genes of cultivated plants. Through nuclear microsatellite loci we studied spatial distribution of genetic variation and population differentiation. We sampled wild and managed populations of the Central-western (Tehuacán, Central Valleys and Tehuantepec, Oaxaca), north-eastern (Huasteca) and south-eastern (Chiapas) regions. Differences among regions and populations were compared through homogeneity and exact test for FIS , AMOVA, Bayesian analysis, and genetic barriers. A niche analysis allowed corroborating taxonomic identity of populations. The highest genetic diversity was in Tehuantepec (HE = 0.841), decreasing towards the extremes of distribution (HE = 0.242 in Huasteca, HE = 0.254 in Chiapas). Genetic structure is significantly high among populations and regional groups, differentiating one group formed by northern and southern populations and other formed by populations of the Central-western region. Differences among groups suggested that populations from Huasteca could be species different to S. pruinosus, but the niche analysis did not support such hypothesis. Populations from Tehuantepec were different but genetically interconnected with those of Tehuacán. Tehuantepec is the main reservoir of genetic diversity of wild populations of S. pruinosus, but Tehuacán is the principal current area of domestication of S. pruinosus and probably where its domestication originated. Conclusions would be stronger by analyzing DNAc lineages. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","<b>Palm diversification in two geologically contrasting regions of western Amazonia<\/b><br><br>Aim: The subduction of the Nazca Plate and the eastward propagation of the Andean orogenic wedge in western Amazonia caused the formation of arches or ridges that have influenced the modern configuration of the upper Amazon drainage and the diversification of biota. We used a lineage of 15 palm species (Astrocaryum sect. Huicungo, Arecaceae) to test two biogeographical hypotheses for lowland plants: (1) that vicariance resulted from tectonically mediated geographical barriers (population contraction), and (2) that recurrent dispersal events (population expansion) produced geographical isolation and subsequent speciation. Location: Rain forests of South America. Methods: A total of 78 palm individuals were collected in the field, from which five chloroplast and two nuclear DNA fragments were sequenced. We reconstructed a Bayesian dated phylogeny and inferred the demographic history. We used a Bayesian phylogeographical spatial diffusion approach to propose a model of colonization. Results: We found a phylogeographical break at c. 5° S between two main clades with crown ages of c. 6.7 and 7.3 Ma located in the Fitzcarrald Arch (FA) and the subsiding northern Amazonian foreland basin (NAFB), respectively. These diversification times were close to the emergence of the FA in the late Miocene, and the coeval development of the transcontinental modern drainage and sedimentation plain of the NAFB. As expected for the recurrent-dispersal hypothesis, lineage delimitations were spatially inconsistent with the location of rivers or ridges, and we found some evidence of past ancestral population expansion supported particularly by the chloroplast sequences. Main conclusions: Our results support the biogeographical scenario whereby recurrent dispersal into western Amazonia produced spatial isolation of populations, followed by speciation within two areas of contrasting geological activity: tectonic uplift in the FA versus subsidence in the NAFB. We did not test and cannot rule out ecological speciation within western Amazonia or at finer spatial scales. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","<b>Spatiotemporal hierarchical modelling of species richness and occupancy using camera trap data<\/b><br><br>Over the last two decades, a large number of camera trap surveys have been carried out around the world and camera traps have been proposed as an ideal tool for inventorying and monitoring medium to large-sized terrestrial vertebrates. However, few studies have analysed camera trap data at the community level. We developed a multi-session multi-species occupancy model that allows us to obtain estimates for species richness and occupancy combining data from multiple camera trap surveys (sessions). By estimating species presence at the session-level and modelling detection probability and occupancy for each species and sessions as nested random effects, we could improve parameter estimates for each session, especially for species with sparse data. We developed two variants of our model: one was a binary latent states model while the other used a Royle-Nichols formulation for the relationship between detection probability and abundance. We applied both models to data from eight camera trap surveys from south-eastern Peru including six study sites, 263 camera stations and 17 423 camera days. Sites covered protected areas, a logging concession and Brazil nut concessions. We included habitat (terra firme vs. floodplain) as a covariate for occupancy and trail vs. off-trail as a covariate for detection. Among-camera heterogeneity was a serious problem for our data and the Royle-Nichols variant of our model had a much better fit than the binary-state variant. Both models resulted in similar species richness estimates showing that most of the sites contained intact large mammal communities. Detection probabilities and occupancy values were more variable across species than across sessions within species. Three species showed a habitat preference and four species showed preference or avoidance of trails. Synthesis and applications. Our multi-session multi-species occupancy model provides improved estimates for species richness and occupancy for a large data set. Our model is ideally suited for integrating large numbers of camera trap data sets to investigate regional and/or temporal patterns in the distribution and composition of mammal communities in relation to natural or anthropogenic factors or to monitor mammal communities over time. © 2015 The Authors.","<b>Defining fishing spatial strategies from VMS data: Insights from the world's largest monospecific fishery<\/b><br><br>Understanding the spatiotemporal behavior of fishermen at the fleet scale is key for defining effective strategies for fisheries management. Here we classify the spatial patterns exhibited by fishing trip trajectories in the world's largest monospecific fishery, the Peruvian anchovy fishery. Our goal is to identify spatial strategies and their possible changes over 2000-2009. The data comprise more than 350,000 fishing trips, recorded using a vessel monitoring system. On-board observers monitored a small fraction of those trips (>2000), providing data for inferring the type of activity (fishing, searching, and cruising) from the position records, for use in a state-space model. Each fishing trip was characterized by its duration, maximum distance to the coast, geographical extension, and time spent fishing, searching and cruising. Using clustering techniques, we identified four types of fishing trips, associated with differences in management among regions, fleet segments, and skippers' behavior. The methodology could be used to investigate fishing spatial strategies using VMS trajectories in other fisheries. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","<b>A Bayesian approach to estimate the biomass of anchovies off the coast of Perú<\/b><br><br>The Northern Humboldt Current System (NHCS) is the world's most productive ecosystem in terms of fish. In particular, the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens) is the major prey of the main top predators, like seabirds, fish, humans, and other mammals. In this context, it is important to understand the dynamics of the anchovy distribution to preserve it as well as to exploit its economic capacities. Using the data collected by the \"Instituto del Mar del Perú\" (IMARPE) during a scientific survey in 2005, we present a statistical analysis that has as main goals: (i) to adapt to the characteristics of the sampled data, such as spatial dependence, high proportions of zeros and big size of samples; (ii) to provide important insights on the dynamics of the anchovy population; and (iii) to propose a model for estimation and prediction of anchovy biomass in the NHCS offshore from Perú. These data were analyzed in a Bayesian framework using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) method. Further, to select the best model and to study the predictive power of each model, we performed model comparisons and predictive checks, respectively. Finally, we carried out a Bayesian spatial influence diagnostic for the preferred model. © 2014, The International Biometric Society.","<b>A comparative analysis of TRMM-rain gauge data merging techniques at the daily time scale for distributed rainfall-runoff modeling applications<\/b><br><br>This study compares two nonparametric rainfall data merging methods-the mean bias correction and double-kernel smoothing-with two geostatistical methods-kriging with external drift and Bayesian combination-for optimizing the hydrometeorological performance of a satellite-based precipitation product over a mesoscale tropical Andean watershed in Peru. The analysis is conducted using 11 years of daily time series from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) research product (also TRMM 3B42) and 173 rain gauges from the national weather station network. The results are assessed using 1) a cross-validation procedure and 2) a catchment water balance analysis and hydrological modeling. It is found that the double-kernel smoothing method delivered the most consistent improvement over the original satellite product in both the cross-validation and hydrological evaluation. The mean bias correction also improved hydrological performance scores, particularly at the subbasin scale where the rain gauge density is higher. Given the spatial heterogeneity of the climate, the size of the modeled catchment, and the sparsity of data, it is concluded that nonparametric merging methods can perform as well as or better than more complex geostatistical methods, whose assumptions may not hold under the studied conditions. Based on these results, a systematic approach to the selection of a satellite-rain gauge data merging technique is proposed that is based on data characteristics. Finally, the underperformance of an ordinary kriging interpolation of the rain gauge data, compared to TMPA and other merged products, supports the use of satellite-based products over gridded rain gauge products that utilize sparse data for hydrological modeling at large scales. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.","<b>A weibull mixture model for the votes of a Brazilian political party<\/b><br><br>Statistical modeling in political analysis is used recently to describe electoral behaviour of political party.

The tribe currently includes seven genera: Aschersoniodoxa, Brayopsis, Dactylocardamum, Delpinophytum, Eudema, Onuris, and Xerodraba, and exhibits a wide morphological diversification in growth habit, inflorescences, and fruits. However, little is known about the phylogenetic relationships and evolution of the tribe. We present here a molecular phylogeny of representative sampling of all genera, utilizing sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal ITS region and chloroplast regions trnL-F, trnH-psbA, and rps16. Additionally, climatic niches of the tribe and its main lineages, along with the evolution of diagnostic morphological characters, were studied. All analyses confirmed the monophyly of Eudemeae, with the exception of Delpinophytum that was included with genera of the lineage I of Brassicaceae. Eudemeae is divided into two main lineages differentiated by their geographical distribution and climatic niche: the primarily north-central Andean lineage included Aschersoniodoxa, Brayopsis, Dactylocardamum, and Eudema, and the Patagonian and southern Andean lineage included Onuris and Xerodraba. Finally, ancestral-state reconstructions in the tribe generally reveal multiple and independent gains or losses of diagnostic morphological characters, such as growth form, inflorescence reduction, and fruit type.

The present study provides genetic data to help clarify this taxonomic issue. DNA was extracted from 10 individuals of each taxon from the states of Florida, USA (White Ibis) and Amapá, Brazil (Scarlet Ibis). The sequences of three mitochondrial and four nuclear markers were obtained from all individuals. The Scarlet Ibis and White Ibis did not share any haplotypes in mitochondrial genes nor in one nuclear marker. Species delimitation using Bayesian analysis, the Knowles-Carstens method and the genealogical sorting index demonstrated the Scarlet Ibis and White Ibis to be two different lineages and revealed a strong signal of speciation despite the polyphyly found in three of the four nuclear markers.","<b>Bayesian posterior prediction of the patchy spatial distributions of small pelagic fish in regions of suitable habitat<\/b><br><br>Small pelagic fish aggregate within areas of suitable habitat to form patchy distributions with localized peaks in abundance. This presents challenges for geostatistical methods designed to investigate the processes underpinning the spatial distribution of stocks and simulate distributions for further analysis. In two-stage models, presence–absence is treated as separable and independent from the process explaining nonzero densities. This is appropriate where gaps in the distribution are attributable to one process and conditional abundance to another, but less so where patchiness is attributable primarily to the strong schooling tendencies of small pelagic fish within suitable habitat. We therefore developed a new modelling framework based on a truncated Gaussian random field (GRF) within a Bayesian framework. We evaluated this method using simulated test data and then applied it to acoustic survey data for Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens). We assessed the method’s performance in terms of posterior densities of spatial parameters, and the density distribution, spatial pattern, and overall spatial distribution of posterior predictions. We conclude that Bayesian posterior prediction based on a truncated GRF is effective at reproducing the patchiness of the observed spatial distribution of anchoveta. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada.

It was found that the integrated linear-neuro model can identify the dynamics of the system much more accurately than a purely linear model or a purely neuro model. It was also found that the state estimation and vibration isolation performance of the system with integrated linear-neuro output feedback control is better than the system with linear control or neuro-control. © 2014 TCCT, CAA.","<b>Validation Of sustainable development practices scale using the Bayesian approach to item response theory<\/b><br><br>There has been growing recognition of the importance of creating performance measurement tools for the economic, social and environmental management of micro and small enterprise (MSE).

Population expansion within Amazonia was tested using neutrality and mismatch distribution tests. Results: trnH-psbA sequences yielded 19 haplotypes restricted to either Mesoamerica or Amazonia; six haplotypes were found among ITS sequences. Diversification of the plastid DNA haplotypes began c. 14.6 Ma. Haplotype diversity for trnH-psbA was higher in Amazonia. Seven genetically differentiated SAMOVA groups were described for trnH-psbA, of which two were also supported by the presence of unique ITS sequences. Population expansion was suggested for both markers for the SAMOVA group that contains most Amazonian populations. Main conclusions: Our results show marked population genetic structure in F. insipida between Mesoamerica and Amazonia, implying that the Andes and seasonally dry areas of northern South America are eco-climatic barriers to its migration. This pattern is shared with other widespread pioneer species affiliated to wet habitats, indicating that the ecological characteristics of species may impact upon large-scale phylogeography. Ficus insipida also shows genetic structure in north-western Amazonia potentially related to pre-Pleistocene historical events. In contrast, evident population expansion elsewhere in Amazonia, in particular the presence of genetically uniform populations across the south-west, indicate recent colonization. Our findings are consistent with palaeoecological data that suggest recent post-glacial expansion of Amazonian forests in the south. © 2014 The Authors.

These link functions will be named power probit and reciprocal power probit due to the relation between them including the probit link as a special case. Also, the probit regressions are special cases of the models considered in this work. A Bayesian inference approach using MCMC is developed for real data suggesting that the link functions proposed here are more appropriate than other link functions used in the literature. In addition, simulation study show that the use of probit model will lead to biased estimate of the regression coefficient. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2014.","<b>Genetic structure in the Amazonian catfish Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii: Influence of life history strategies<\/b><br><br>The Dorado or Plateado (Gilded catfish) Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii (Pimelodidae, Siluriformes) is a commercially valuable migratory catfish performing the largest migration in freshwaters: from the Amazonian headwaters in the Andean foothills (breeding area) to the Amazon estuary (nursery area). In spite of its importance to inform management and conservation efforts, the genetic variability of this species has only recently begun to be studied. The aim of the present work was to determine the population genetic structure of B. rousseauxii in two regions: the Upper Madera Basin (five locations in the Bolivian Amazon) and the Western Amazon Basin (one regional sample from the Uyucalí-Napo-Marañon-Amazon basin, Peru). Length polymorphism at nine microsatellite loci (284 individuals) was used to determine genetic variability and to identify the most probable panmictic units (using a Bayesian approach), after a significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed in the overall dataset (Western Amazon + Upper Madera). Bayesian analyses revealed at least three clusters in admixture in the five locations sampled in the Bolivian Amazon, whereas only two of these clusters were observed in the Western Amazon. Considering the migratory behaviour of B. rousseauxii, different life history strategies, including homing, are proposed to explain the cluster distribution. Our results are discussed in the light of the numerous threats to the species survival in the Madera basin, in particular dam and reservoir construction. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","<b>Extensions of the skew-normal ogive item response model<\/b><br><br>We introduce new applications of the skew-probit IRT model by considering a flexible skew-normal distribution for the latent variables and by extending this model to include an additional random effect for modeling dependence between items within the same testlet. A Bayesian hierarchical structure is presented using a double data augmentation approach. This can be easily implemented in WinBUGS or SAS by considering MCMC algorithms. Several Bayesian model selection criteria, such as DIC, EAIC and EBIC, have been considered; in addition, we use posterior sum of squares of the latent residuals as a global discrepancy measure to model comparison. Two applications illustrate the methodology, one data set related to a mathematical test and another related to reading comprehension, both applied to Peruvian students. Results indicate better performance of the more flexible models proposed in this paper. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2014.","<b>Estimation methods for multivariate Tobit confirmatory factor analysis<\/b><br><br>Tobit confirmatory factor analysis is particularly useful in analysis of multivariate data with censored information. Two methods for estimating multivariate Tobit confirmatory factor analysis models with covariates from a Bayesian and likelihood-based perspectives are proposed. In contrast with previous likelihood-based developments that consider Monte Carlo simulations for maximum likelihood estimation, an exact EM-type algorithm is proposed. Also, the estimation of the parameters via MCMC techniques by considering a hierarchical formulation of the model is explored. Bayesian case deletion influence diagnostics based on the q-divergence measure and model selection criteria is also developed and considered in the analysis of a real dataset related to the education assessment field. In addition, a simulation study is conducted to compare the performance of the proposed method with the traditional confirmatory factor analysis. The results show that both methods offer more precise inferences than the traditional confirmatory factor analysis, which ignores the information about the censoring threshold. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Opinions of experts who have worked with species of interest in the field can be a valuable and independent information source to validate EEM because of their first-hand experience with species occurrence and absence. However, their use in model validation is limited because of the subjectivity of their feedback. In this study, we present a method on the basis of cultural consensus theory to formalize expert model evaluations. Methods: We developed, for five tree species, distribution models with nine different variable combinations and Maxent EEM software. Species specialists validated the generated distribution maps through an online Google Earth interface with the scores from Invalid to Excellent. Experts were also asked about the commission and omission errors of the distribution models they evaluated. We weighted expert scores according to consensus theory. These values were used to obtain a final average expert score for each of the produced distribution models. The consensus-weighted expert scores were compared with un-weighted scores and correlated to four conventional model performance parameters after cross-validation with test data: Area Under Curve (AUC), maximum Kappa, commission error and omission error. Results: The median consensus-weighted expert score of all species-variable combinations was close to Fair. In general, experts that reached more consensus with peers were more positive about the EEM outcomes, compared to those that had more opposite judgements. Both consensus-weighted and un-weighted scores were significantly correlated to corresponding AUC, maximum Kappa and commission error values, but not to omission errors. More than half of the experts indicated that the distribution model they considered best included areas where the species is known to be absent. One third also indicated areas of species presence that were omitted by the model. Conclusions: Our results indicate that experts are fairly positive about EEM outcomes. This is encouraging, but EEM application for conservation actions remains limited according to them. Methods to formalize expert knowledge allow a wider use of this information in model validation and improvement, and they complement conventional validation methods of presence-only modelling. Online GIS and survey applications facilitate the consultation of experts. © 2013 International Association for Vegetation Science.","<b>An extended exponentiated-G-negative binomial family with threshold effect<\/b><br><br>In this paper, we formulate a very flexible family of models which unifies most recent lifetime distributions. The main idea is to obtain a cumulative distribution function to transform the baseline distribution with an activation mechanism characterized by a latent threshold variable. The new family has a strong biological interpretation from the competitive risks point of view and the Box-Cox transformation provides an elegant manner to interpret the effect on the baseline distribution to obtain this alternative model. Several structural properties of the new model are investigated.

Bolivia is a centre of wild relative diversity for several crops, among them potato, which is an important staple worldwide and the principal food crop in this country. Despite their relevance for plant breeding, limited knowledge exists about their in situ conservation status. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and distribution modelling with the software Maxent to better understand geographic patterns of endemic wild potato diversity in Bolivia. In combination with threat layers, we assessed the conservation status of all endemic species, 21 in total. We prioritised areas for in situ conservation by using complementary reserve selection and excluded 25% of the most-threatened collection sites because costs to implement conservation measures at those locations may be too high compared to other areas. Some 70% (15 of 21 species) has a preliminary vulnerable status or worse according to IUCN red list distribution criteria. Our results show that four of these species would require special conservation attention because they were only observed in <15 locations and are highly threatened by human accessibility, fires and livestock pressure. Although highest species richness occurs in south-central Bolivia, in the departments Santa Cruz and Chuquisaca, the first priority area for in situ conservation according to our reserve selection exercise is central Bolivia, Cochabamba; this area is less threatened than the potato wild relatives' hotspot in south-central Bolivia. Only seven of the 21 species were observed in protected areas. To improve coverage of potato wild relatives' distribution by protected areas, we recommend starting inventories in parks and reserves with high modelled diversity. Finally, to improve ex situ conservation, we targeted areas for germplasm collection of species with <5 accessions conserved in genebanks. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.","<b>Molecular phylogeny of daucus (apiaceae)<\/b><br><br>We studied the phylogeny of 22 accessions of Daucus and seven accessions in related genera, with DNA sequences from eight nuclear orthologs and one plastid (psbA/trnH) region. Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of the concatenated data matrix of 7,212 aligned nucleotides provided excellent bootstrap support for many clades. Concordant with prior molecular results Pseudorlaya pumila was firmly imbedded within Daucus, as was Margottia gummifera, a new finding. All accessions of D. capillifolius, D. carota, and D. sahariensis formed a 2n = 18 clade with all other species within the Daucus clade with chromosome numbers of = 20, 22, and 44 (D. glochidiatus). Sister to the D. carota clade was a clade containing Margottia gummifera and Pseudorlaya pumila, sister to these species was D. crinitus, sister to all the above was D. muricatus, and sister to all of the above was a clade containing the remaining Daucus species. Bayesian analyses of individual regions analyzed separately and averaged over multiple trees with *BEAST software (a coalescent approach), however, provided a phylogeny at variance with the concatenated approach, most notably in firmly imbedding Turgenia latifolia within Daucus. © 2013 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.","<b>Multiple genetic origins of histidine-rich protein 2 gene deletion in Plasmodium falciparum parasites from Peru<\/b><br><br>The majority of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detect Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), encoded by the pfhrp2 gene. Recently, P. falciparum isolates from Peru were found to lack pfhrp2 leading to false-negative RDT results. We hypothesized that pfhrp2-deleted parasites in Peru derived from a single genetic event. We evaluated the parasite population structure and pfhrp2 haplotype of samples collected between 1998 and 2005 using seven neutral and seven chromosome 8 microsatellite markers, respectively. Five distinct pfhrp2 haplotypes, corresponding to five neutral microsatellite-based clonal lineages, were detected in 1998-2001; pfhrp2 deletions occurred within four haplotypes. In 2003-2005, outcrossing among the parasite lineages resulted in eight population clusters that inherited the five pfhrp2 haplotypes seen previously and a new haplotype; pfhrp2 deletions occurred within four of these haplotypes. These findings indicate that the genetic origin of pfhrp2 deletion in Peru was not a single event, but likely occurred multiple times.","<b>Population structure of the Chagas disease vector, Triatoma infestans, at the urban-rural interface<\/b><br><br>The increasing rate of biological invasions resulting from human transport or human-mediated changes to the environment has had devastating ecological and public health consequences. The kissing bug, Triatoma infestans, has dispersed through the Peruvian city of Arequipa. The biological invasion of this insect has resulted in a public health crisis, putting thousands of residents of this city at risk of infection by Trypanosoma cruzi and subsequent development of Chagas disease. Here, we show that populations of Tria. infestans in geographically distinct districts within and around this urban centre share a common recent evolutionary history although current gene flow is restricted even between proximal sites. The population structure among the Tria. infestans in different districts is not correlated with the geographical distance between districts. These data suggest that migration among the districts is mediated by factors beyond the short-range migratory capabilities of Tria. infestans and that human movement has played a significant role in the structuring of the Tria. infestans population in the region. Rapid urbanization across southern South America will continue to create suitable environments for Tria. infestans, and knowledge of its urban dispersal patterns may play a fundamental role in mitigating human disease risk. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","<b>Hidden Markov Models: The Best Models for Forager Movements?<\/b><br><br>One major challenge in the emerging field of movement ecology is the inference of behavioural modes from movement patterns. This has been mainly addressed through Hidden Markov models (HMMs). We propose here to evaluate two sets of alternative and state-of-the-art modelling approaches. First, we consider hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs). They may better represent the behavioural dynamics of foragers since they explicitly model the duration of the behavioural modes. Second, we consider discriminative models which state the inference of behavioural modes as a classification issue, and may take better advantage of multivariate and non linear combinations of movement pattern descriptors. For this work, we use a dataset of >200 trips from human foragers, Peruvian fishermen targeting anchovy. Their movements were recorded through a Vessel Monitoring System (∼1 record per hour), while their behavioural modes (fishing, searching and cruising) were reported by on-board observers. We compare the efficiency of hidden Markov, hidden semi-Markov, and three discriminative models (random forests, artificial neural networks and support vector machines) for inferring the fishermen behavioural modes, using a cross-validation procedure. HSMMs show the highest accuracy (80%), significantly outperforming HMMs and discriminative models. Simulations show that data with higher temporal resolution, HSMMs reach nearly 100% of accuracy. Our results demonstrate to what extent the sequential nature of movement is critical for accurately inferring behavioural modes from a trajectory and we strongly recommend the use of HSMMs for such purpose. In addition, this work opens perspectives on the use of hybrid HSMM-discriminative models, where a discriminative setting for the observation process of HSMMs could greatly improve inference performance. © 2013 Joo et al.","<b>Management of Nothofagus genetic resources: Definition of genetic zones based on a combination of nuclear and chloroplast marker data<\/b><br><br>Development of appropriate forest conservation and management measures for a given tree species includes the identification of distinct genetically homogeneous units across its overall distribution range, which depends on the availability of knowledge on genetic, morphological and adaptive variation. This has important implications for germplasm transfer within and between areas, for example in reforestation or restoration activities. Genetic zones are defined as genetically more or less homogeneous regions within which propagation material can be transferred with relative certainty not to cause changes at the genetic structure level. The main goal of this study was to define genetic zones for Nothofagus nervosa and Nothofagus obliqua within their Argentinean natural distribution range. A total of 823 individuals belonging to 24 populations (14 of N. nervosa and 10 of N. obliqua, μ=. 34. ±. 5) were genotyped by means of seven nuclear microsatellite markers. The geographic clustering encountered through the application of a Bayesian approach was analyzed in combination with additional information on diversity parameters, chloroplast DNA and isozymes. For assembling the maps showing the distribution of clusters, we averaged cluster membership values of trees in each grid cell. To visualize geographical patterns in nSRR richness and the distribution of different clusters of both species, we carried out grid-based spatial analyses using 30. s grid cells (~1. km at the equator) as the unit of analyses. We distinguished five genetic zones for N. nervosa and three for N. obliqua, consistent with the management history of the species, and displaying a certain level of geographic congruence. Higher allelic richness values were found in the surroundings of areas identified as potential glacial refugia, which suggest that the distribution pattern of allelic richness is closely associated with the glacial history of the species within the region. We expect this information to constitute a valuable tool for the identification of seed transfer zones, and to guide recruitment and plantation activities in the context of domestication programs of both species in Argentina. For assisted migration programs under progressive climate change the identification of these zones together with knowledge concerning hotspots at genetic diversity level should constitute an input for planning the activities. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Bats are a major natural reservoir for hepaciviruses and pegiviruses<\/b><br><br>Although there are over 1,150 bat species worldwide, the diversity of viruses harbored by bats has only recently come into focus as a result of expanded wildlife surveillance. Such surveys are of importance in determining the potential for novel viruses to emerge in humans, and for optimal management of bats and their habitats. To enhance our knowledge of the viral diversity present in bats, we initially surveyed 415 sera from African and Central American bats. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing revealed the presence of a highly diverse group of bat-derived viruses related to hepaciviruses and pegiviruses within the family Flaviridae. Subsequent PCR screening of 1,258 bat specimens collected worldwide indicated the presence of these viruses also in North America and Asia. A total of 83 bat-derived viruses were identified, representing an infection rate of nearly 5%. Evolutionary analyses revealed that all known hepaciviruses and pegiviruses, including those previously documented in humans and other primates, fall within the phylogenetic diversity of the bat-derived viruses described here. The prevalence, unprecedented viral biodiversity, phylogenetic divergence, and worldwide distribution of the bat-derived viruses suggest that bats are a major and ancient natural reservoir for both hepaciviruses and pegiviruses and provide insights into the evolutionary history of hepatitis C virus and the human GB viruses.","<b>Learning Bayesian network using parse trees for extraction of protein-protein interaction<\/b><br><br>Extraction of protein-protein interactions from scientific papers is a relevant task in the biomedical field. Machine learning-based methods such as kernel-based represent the state-of-the-art in this task. Many efforts have focused on obtaining new types of kernels in order to employ syntactic information, such as parse trees, to extract interactions from sentences. These methods have reached the best performances on this task. Nevertheless, parse trees were not exploited by other machine learning-based methods such as Bayesian networks. The advantage of using Bayesian networks is that we can exploit the structure of the parse trees to learn the Bayesian network structure, i.e., the parse trees provide the random variables and also possible relations among them. Here we use syntactic relation as a causal dependence between variables. Hence, our proposed method learns a Bayesian network from parse trees. The evaluation was carried out over five protein-protein interaction benchmark corpora. Results show that our method is competitive in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","<b>An Estimated Stochastic General Equilibrium Model with Partial Dollarization: A Bayesian Approach<\/b><br><br>In this paper, we develop and estimate a dynamic stochastic, general-equilibrium New Keynesian model with partial dollarization. Bayesian techniques and Peruvian data are used to evaluate two forms of dollarization: currency substitution (CS) and price dollarization (PD). The empirical results are as follow: first, it is noted that the two forms of partial dollarization are important in explaining the significance of the Peruvian data. Second, models with both forms of dollarization dominate models without dollarization. Third, a counterfactual exercise shows that by eliminating both forms of partial dollarization, the response of both output and consumption to a monetary policy shock doubles, making the interest rate channel of monetary policy more effective. Fourth, based on the variance decomposition of the preferred model (with CS and PD), it is found that demand type shocks explain almost all the fluctuation in CPI inflation, the monetary shock being the most important (39%). Remarkably, foreign disturbances account for 34% of the output fluctuations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","<b>High jaguar densities and large population sizes in the core habitat of the southwestern Amazon<\/b><br><br>Over 80% of the currently occupied range of the jaguar (Panthera onca) lies in the Amazon. However, few density estimates exist for this habitat. Between 2005 and 2010 we carried out six camera trap surveys at three different sites in the department of Madre de Dios in the Peruvian Amazon. We analyzed our data using a Bayesian spatially explicit capture recapture model (SECR) with sex covariates to account for differences in home range size and detection probabilities of male and female jaguars. As several of our camera grids where too small for reliable density estimates, we used estimates for the σ parameter from the largest camera grid to correct for the bias. Density estimates for our surveys were similar with an average density of 4.4±0.7 jaguar 100km-2. Both home range size and encounter rates varied significantly between sexes with males having a larger home range and higher encounter rate than females. Our estimated sex ratio was 1:1.5 compared to an observed ratio of 1.9:1. Not accounting for sex would have resulted in an underestimation of the true density. The densities found in this study are among the highest documented and show that the Amazon is indeed a core habitat for the jaguar. We estimate that three jaguar conservation units in our study region (areas defined by experts as having a high conservation priority) could harbor as many as 6000 jaguars (CI: 4278-8142). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","<b>Molecular evidence for the polyphyly of Bostryx (Gastropoda: Bulimulidae) and genetic diversity of Bostryx aguilari<\/b><br><br>Bostryx is largely distributed in Andean Valleys and Lomas formations along the coast of Peru and Chile. One species, Bostryx aguilari, is restricted to Lomas formations located in the Department of Lima (Peru). The use of genetic information has become essential in phylogenetic and population studies with conservation purposes. Considering the rapid degradation of desert ecosystems, which threatens the survival of vulnerable species, the aim of this study was, first, to resolve evolutionary relationships within Bostryx and to determine the position of Bostryx within the Bulimulidae, and second, to survey the genetic diversity of Bostryx aguilari, a species considered rare. Sequences of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA and nuclear rRNA regions were obtained for 12 and 11 species of Bulimulidae, respectively, including seven species of Bostryx. Sequences of the 16S rRNA gene were obtained for 14 individuals (from four different populations) of Bostryx aguilari. Phylogenetic reconstructions were carried out using Neighbor-Joining, Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference methods. The monophyly of Bostryx was not supported. In our results, B. solutus (type species of Bostryx) grouped only with B. aguilari, B. conspersus, B. modestus, B. scalariformis and B. sordidus, forming a monophyletic group that is strongly supported in all analyses. In case the taxonomy of Bostryx is reviewed in the future, this group should keep the generic name. Bostryx aguilari was found to have both low genetic diversity and small population size. We recommend that conservation efforts should be increased in Lomas ecosystems to ensure the survival of B. aguilari, and a large number of other rare species restricted to Lomas. © 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.","<b>Molecular taxonomy of Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) benarrochi (Diptera: Culicidae) and malaria epidemiology in Southern Amazonian Peru<\/b><br><br>Anopheline specimens were collected in 2011 by human landing catch, Shannon and CDC traps from the malaria endemic localities of Santa Rosa and San Pedro in Madre de Dios Department, Peru. Most specimens were either Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) benarrochi B or An.

A few specimens from Lupuna, Loreto Department, northern Amazonian Peru, were also identified as An. benarrochi B. A statistical parsimony network using ITS2 sequences confirmed that all Peruvian An. benarrochi B analyzed were identical to those in GenBank from Putumayo, southern Colombia. Sequences of the mtDNA COI BOLD region of specimens from all three Peruvian localities were connected using a statistical parsimony network, although there were multiple mutation steps between northern and southern Peruvian sequences. A Bayesian inference of concatenated Peruvian sequences of ITS2+COI detected a single clade with very high support for all An. benarrochi B except one individual from Lupuna that was excluded.

Until recently, their taxonomy was not clearly established, with discrepancies between morphological and molecular analyses. Here, Pseudoplatystoma species from the Peruvian Amazon were characterized at the molecular level from a sample representing the observed range of their color pattern variations in the study area. Analyses were performed using seven microsatellite loci for 103 specimens and, for part of them (52), using sequences of two regions of their mitochondrial genome [Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI) and Control Region (CR)]. Factorial correspondence analysis and assignment tests based on microsatellite polymorphism showed that the specimens originally identified as P. punctifer belonged to two different gene pools highly differentiated from P. tigrinum. Morphological examination identified two different morphotypes (with and without black stripes), suggesting the existence of two distinct taxa within P. punctifer. This result was corroborated by the ML tree based on CR sequences, where all individuals but four clustered in a similar way as in the FCA and Bayesian assignment tests. For these four individuals, mitochondrial introgression or retention of ancestral polymorphism was likely. In contrast, the ML tree based on COI sequences showed that reciprocal monophyly was not yet achieved for this marker for the two P. punctifer taxa. The existence of three sympatric species of Pseudoplatystoma in the Peruvian Amazon is discussed in relation to their molecular characteristics, color patterns and ecology.

We review the influence of geological events such as the Pebas system, the Andean uplift and the land connections between South and Central/North America, on the historical assembly of Neotropical palms. We present a case study of the palm genus Astrocaryum (40 species) as a model for evaluating colonization and diversification patterns of lowland Neotropical taxa. We conducted a Bayesian dated phylogenetic analysis based on four low-copy nuclear DNA regions and a biogeographical analysis using the dispersal, extinction and cladogenesis model. Cladogenesis of Western Amazonian Astrocaryum spp. (c.6Mya) post-dated the drainage of the aquatic Pebas system, supporting the constraining role of Pebas on in situ diversification and colonization. The ancestral distribution of Astrocaryum spp. in the Guiana Shield supported the hypothesis of an old formation that acted as a source area from which species colonized adjacent regions, but an earliest branching position for Guianan species was not confidently recovered. A twofold increase in diversification rate was found in a clade, the ancestor of which occupied the Guiana Shield (c.13Mya, a time of climatic change and Andean uplift). © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.","<b>Systematics and evolutionary history of butterflies in the \"Taygetis clade\" (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae: Euptychiina): Towards a better understanding of Neotropical biogeography<\/b><br><br>The so-called \"Taygetis clade\" is a group of exclusively Neotropical butterflies classified within Euptychiina, one of the largest subtribes in the subfamily Satyrinae. Since the distribution of the ten genera belonging to this group ranges throughout the entire Neotropics, from lowlands to lower montane habitats, it offers a remarkable opportunity to study the region's biogeographic history as well as different scenarios for speciation in upland areas. We inferred a robust and well-sampled phylogeny using DNA sequences from four genes (4035. bp in total) using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. We estimated divergence times using the Bayesian relaxed clock method calibrated with node ages from previous studies. Ancestral ranges of distribution were estimated using the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model as implemented in the program Lagrange. We propose several taxonomic changes and recognize nine well-supported natural genera within the \"Taygetis clade\": Forsterinaria (subsuming Guaianaza syn. nov.), Parataygetis, Posttaygetis, Harjesia (excluding Harjesia griseola and Harjesia oreba), Pseudodebis (including Taygetomorpha syn. nov.,), Taygetina (subsuming Coeruleotaygetis syn. nov., Harjesia oreba comb. nov., Taygetis weymeri comb. nov. and Taygetis kerea comb. nov.), Taygetis (excluding Taygetis ypthima, Taygetis rectifascia, Taygetis kerea and Taygetis weymeri), and two new genera, one containing Harjesia griseola, and the other Taygetis ypthima and Taygetis rectifascia. The group diversified mainly during late Miocene to Pliocene, coinciding with the period of drastic changes in landscape configuration in the Neotropics. Major dispersals inferred from the Amazon basin towards northwestern South America, the Atlantic forests and the eastern slope of the Andes have mostly shaped the evolution and diversification of the group. Furthermore, expansion of larval dietary repertoire might have aided net diversification in the two largest genera in the clade, Forsterinaria and Taygetis. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Phylogeography and Sex-Biased Dispersal across Riverine Manatee Populations (Trichechus inunguis and Trichechus manatus) in South America<\/b><br><br>Phylogeographic patterns and sex-biased dispersal were studied in riverine populations of West Indian (Trichechus manatus) and Amazonian manatees (T. inunguis) in South America, using 410bp D-loop (Control Region, Mitochondrial DNA) sequences and 15 nuclear microsatellite loci. This multi-locus approach was key to disentangle complex patterns of gene flow among populations. D-loop analyses revealed population structuring among all Colombian rivers for T. manatus, while microsatellite data suggested no structure. Two main populations of T. inunguis separating the Colombian and Peruvian Amazon were supported by analysis of the D-loop and microsatellite data. Overall, we provide molecular evidence for differences in dispersal patterns between sexes, demonstrating male-biased gene flow dispersal in riverine manatees. These results are in contrast with previously reported levels of population structure shown by microsatellite data in marine manatee populations, revealing low habitat restrictions to gene flow in riverine habitats, and more significant dispersal limitations for males in marine environments. © 2012 Satizábal et al.","<b>Intra- and interspecific tree growth across a long altitudinal gradient in the Peruvian Andes<\/b><br><br>Tree growth response across environmental gradients is fundamental to understanding species distributional ecology and forest ecosystem ecology and to predict future ecosystem services. Cross-sectional patterns of ecosystem properties with respect to climatic gradients are often used to predict ecosystem responses to global change. Across sites in the tropics, primary productivity increases with temperature, suggesting that forest ecosystems will become more productive as temperature rises. However, this trend is confounded with a shift in species composition and so may not reflect the response of in situ forests to warming. In this study, we simultaneously studied tree diameter growth across the altitudinal ranges of species within a single genus across a geographically compact temperature gradient, to separate the direct effect of temperature on tree growth from that of species compositional turnover. Using a Bayesian state space modeling framework we combined data from repeated diameter censuses and dendrometer measurements from across a 1700-m altitudinal gradient collected over six years on over 2400 trees in Weinmannia, a dominant and widespread genus of cloud forest trees in the Andes. Within species, growth showed no consistent trend with altitude, but higher-elevation species had lower growth rates than lowerelevation species, suggesting that species turnover is largely responsible for the positive correlation between productivity and temperature in tropical forests. Our results may indicate a significant difference in how low- and high-latitude forests will respond to climate change, since temperate and boreal tree species are consistently observed to have a positive relationship between growth and temperature. If our results hold for other tropical species, a positive response in ecosystem productivity to increasing temperatures in the Andes will depend on the altitudinal migration of tree species. The rapid pace of climate change, and slow observed rates of migration, suggest a slow, or even initially negative response of ecosystem productivity to warming. Finally, this study shows how the observed scale of biological organization can affect conclusions drawn from studies of ecological phenomena across environmental gradients, and calls into question the common practice in tropical ecology of lumping species at higher taxonomic levels. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","<b>Predicting Polylepis distribution: Vulnerable and increasingly important Andean woodlands<\/b><br><br>Polylepis woodlands are a vital resource for preserving biodiversity and hydrological functions, which will be altered by climate change and challenge the sustainability of local human communities. However, these high-altitude Andean ecosystems are becoming increasingly vulnerable due to anthropogenic pressure including fragmentation, deforestation and the increase in livestock. Predicting the distribution of native woodlands has become increasingly important to counteract the negative effects of climate change through reforestation and conservation. The objective of this study was to develop and analyze the distribution models of two species that form extensive woodlands along the Andes, namely Polylepis sericea and P. weberbaueri. This study utilized the program Maxent, climate and remotely sensed environmental layers at 1 Km resolution. The predicted distribution model for P. sericea indicated that the species could be located in a variety of habitats along the Andean Cordillera, while P. weberbaueri was restricted to the high elevations of southern Peru and Bolivia. For both species, elevation and temperature metrics were the most significant factors for predicted distribution. Further model refinement of Polylepis and other Andean species using increasingly available satellite data demonstrate the potential to help define areas of diversity and improve conservation strategies for the Andes. © Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas UNMSM.","<b>Global phylogeography and evolution of chelonid fibropapilloma-associated herpesvirus<\/b><br><br>A global phylogeny for chelonid fibropapilloma-associated herpesvirus (CFPHV), the most likely aetiological agent of fibropapillomatosis (FP) in sea turtles, was inferred, using dated sequences, through Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis and used to estimate the virus evolutionary rate independent of the evolution of the host, and to resolve the phylogenetic positions of new haplotypes from Puerto Rico and the Gulf of Guinea. Four phylogeographical groups were identified: eastern Pacific, western Atlantic/eastern Caribbean, mid-west Pacific and Atlantic. The latter comprises the Gulf of Guinea and Puerto Rico, suggesting recent virus gene flow between these two regions. One virus haplotype from Florida remained elusive, representing either an independent lineage sharing a common ancestor with all other identified virus variants or an Atlantic representative of the lineage giving rise to the eastern Pacific group. The virus evolutionary rate ranged from 1.62×10 -4 to 2.22×10 -4 substitutions per site per year, which is much faster than what is expected for a herpesvirus. The mean time for the most recent common ancestor of the modern virus variants was estimated at 192.90-429.71 years ago, which, although more recent than previous estimates, still supports an interpretation that the global FP pandemic is not the result of a recent acquisition of a virulence mutation(s). The phylogeographical pattern obtained seems partially to reflect sea turtle movements, whereas altered environments appear to be implicated in current FP outbreaks and in the modern evolutionary history of CFPHV. © 2012 SGM.","<b>Spatial genetic structure and demographic inference of the Patagonian squid Doryteuthis gahi in the south-eastern Pacific Ocean<\/b><br><br>Doryteuthis gahi is a small squid species that has a wide distribution in South America. This species is characterized by coastal and benthic spawning, and its ontogenetic vertical migration is associated with upwelling zones, features that may restrict its dispersal potential. It has also been proposed that populations of these neritic squid are structured by the influence of local processes which act as barriers to gene flow. Based on this background, we evaluate the geographical structure of genetic diversity in D. gahi along its distribution in the south-eastern Pacific Ocean. We used 116 COI mtDNA sequences of squid collected from different sites in Peru and Chile and calculated genetic diversity, the population structure index Fst, and performed analysis of spatial molecular variance and exact tests to detect differences among localities. To infer demographic history we carried out tests of neutrality and Bayesian skyline analysis. Although there was little molecular divergence between Peru and Chile, we detected a significant genetic differentiation of D. gahi along its geographical distribution. Squid from Chile showed higher genetic diversity than those of Peru and the results of the demographic inference analysis suggest that the population of Peru is experiencing or experienced in the recent past demographic expansion, a pattern that was not found in Chile. We think that the current genetic patterns are consequences of northward migrations in the glaciation periods and posterior re-colonization of southern Chile in the deglacial period.

This new model includes the Beta regression model introduced by Ferrari and Cribari-Neto (2004) and the variable dispersion Beta regression model introduced by Smithson and Verkuilen (2006) as particular cases. Like Branscum, Johnson, and Thurmond (2007), a Bayesian inference approach is adopted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. Simulation studies on the influence of outliers by considering contaminated data under four perturbation patterns to generate outliers were carried out and confirm that the Beta rectangular regression model seems to be a new robust alternative for modeling proportion data and that the Beta regression model shows sensitivity to the estimation of regression coeficients, to the posterior distribution of all parameters and to the model comparison criteria considered. Furthermore, two applications are presented to illustrate the robustness of the Beta rectangular model. © 2012 International Society for Bayesian Analysis.","<b>Support and surprises: Molecular phylogeny of the land snail superfamily Orthalicoidea using a three-locus gene analysis with a divergence time analysis and ancestral area reconstruction (Gastropoda: Stylommatophora)<\/b><br><br>Phylogenetic relationships of Orthalicoidea, a highly diverse and dominant element in the Neotropics, were studied using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences (ITS2/28S, CO1, H3). Specimens of various locations from the Southern Hemisphere (South America, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Solomon Islands) were analysed (74 taxa, representing 30 genera). Our results support previously presented hypotheses, but also give surprises in terms of unexpected topologies. Phylogenetic trees were estimated using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference, and compared with traditional classifications. Phylogenetic estimations using three loci gave a strong support for monophyly of Orthalicoidea, as well as for some clades within this group (Bulimulidae, Bothriembryontidae, Orthalicidae, Amphibulimulidae), but not for others (Odontostomidae and Megaspiridae). In the resulting revision of the classification scheme of the Orthalicoidea, the tribe Simpulopsini is raised to family rank. One new subfamily is recognized, the Bostrycinae. The family Bulimulidae Tryon 1867 is retained under ICZN Art. 35.5, despite the senior synonymy of Peltellinae Gray 1855. Our analysis supports an origin of the Orthalicoidea in South America, with subsequent radiations into other parts of the Neotropics and the Southern Hemisphere. The hypothesis that the distribution on the southern continents may be explained by vicariance due to break-up of Gondwana is only partially supported by divergence time analysis using fossil calibrations. Ancestral area reconstruction suggests various independent dispersals out of South America into Central America and the West Indies, and possibly two independent dispersals to explain the remaining relations between groups of taxa on the southern continents. Divergence time analysis further shows that the major diversification of extant taxa within the superfamily may have started around the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. © E.

The subgenus can be split geographically, with almost equal diversity in the Northern Hemisphere (centred in Mexico and Guatemala) and in the Southern Hemisphere (centred in Peru and Bolivia). Only a few species are known from a limited number of localities between these two hotspots. As such, Tildenia is an ideal candidate with which to test time, direction and mode of migration of high mountain taxa against the background of the 'Great American Biotic Interchange'. Location The Andes with focus on the Central Andes, and the Mexican mountain chains, especially the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Methods To elucidate the spatio-temporal origin, subsequent colonization and radiation of Tildenia, we combine Bayesian phylogenetics based on the chloroplast trnK-matK-psbA region, georeferenced distribution data, and fossil calibrated molecular dating approaches using both penalized likelihood and relaxed phylogenetics. Reconstruction of the ancestral distribution area was performed using dispersal-vicariance analysis and dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis. Results Peperomia subgenus Tildenia is subdivided into six Andean clades and one Mexican and Central American clade originating from a north/central Peruvian ancestor. Molecular dating approaches converge on a stem age of c.38Ma for Tildenia and a mostly Miocene diversification and colonization. Main conclusions We detect a strong correlation between diversification of Tildenia and orogenetic events in the respective distribution centres. In the Andes, distribution was influenced by the Altiplano-Eastern Cordillera System as well as the Amotape-Huancabamba Zone, where the latter serves as both migration barrier and migration bridge for different clades. In contrast to most studies of high-elevation taxa, we provide support for a south-north colonization towards Central America and Mexico, and provide additional, independent evidence for the latest view on the timing of the Great American Biotic Interchange. In Mexico, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt has played a major role in more recent radiations together with climatic oscillation and the formation of refugia. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","<b>Biogeographic implications of the striking discovery of a 4,000 kilometer disjunct population of the wild potato Solanum morelliforme in South America<\/b><br><br>Solanum morelliforme is an epiphytic wild potato (Solanum section Petota) species widely distributed throughout central Mexico to Honduras.

One of the most startling yet overlooked growth forms is the geophytic one, as in subgenus Tildenia. This group occurs in seasonal Neotropical habitats with its highest diversity in Mexico-Guatemala and Peru-Bolivia with few species known from in between these hot spots. Methods - Recent fieldwork in Peru and Bolivia combined with herbarium study and a Bayesian analysis of an aligned sequence matrix of the chloroplast trnK-matK-psbA gene cluster of one accession of each species resulted in new findings within this subgenus. Key results - Fourteen new species are described, discussed in a phylogenetic framework and illustrated. Two species have a wide distribution and occur from central W. Peru to S. Bolivia: the common P. cerrateae and the rare P. parvisagittata. Three endemic species are described from the Amotape-Huancabamba Zone which is particularly rich in tuberous Peperomia species: P. gigantea, P. jalcaensis and P. klopfensteinii. Two species are only known from their type locality in central W. Peru: P. ocrosensis and P. pugnicaudex. Five other Peruvian species are P. ayacuchoana from Ayacucho, P. querocochana from Ancash, P. wernerrauhii from Huánuco, Peperomia umbrosa from three distant localities, and P. pseudoverruculosa which is relatively common in SE Peru. Two species are Bolivian endemics: the rare P. purpureonervosa from La Paz and the more common P. radiatinervosa from Cochabamba and Chuquisaca. Two former varieties, both endemics of the extreme northern Central Andes, are raised to species rank: P. lilliputiana and P. pseudoperuviana.

Since 2000, there has been sustained low P. falciparum transmission. The Malaria Immunology and Genetics in the Amazon project has longitudinally followed members of the community of Zungarococha (N = 1,945, 4 villages) with active household and health center-based visits each year since 2003. We examined parasite population structure and traced the parasite genetic diversity temporally and spatially. We genotyped infections over 5 years (2003-2007) using 14 microsatellite (MS) markers scattered across ten different chromosomes. Despite low transmission, there was considerable genetic diversity, which we compared with other geographic regions. We detected 182 different haplotypes from 302 parasites in 217 infections. Structure v2.2 identified five clusters (subpopulations) of phylogenetically related clones. To consider genetic diversity on a more detailed level, we defined haplotype families (hapfams) by grouping haplotypes with three or less loci differences. We identified 34 different hapfams identified. The Fst statistic and heterozygosity analysis showed the five clusters were maintained in each village throughout this time. A minimum spanning network (MSN), stratified by the year of detection, showed that haplotypes within hapfams had allele differences and haplotypes within a cluster definition were more separated in the later years (2006-2007). We modeled hapfam detection and loss, accounting for sample size and stochastic fluctuations in frequencies overtime. Principle component analysis of genetic variation revealed patterns of genetic structure with time rather than village. The population structure, genetic diversity, appearance/disappearance of the different haplotypes from 2003 to 2007 provides a genome-wide \"real-time\" perspective of P. falciparum parasites in a low transmission region. © 2011 The Author.","<b>Genetic diversity and demographic history of Dosidicus gigas (Cephalopoda: Ommastrephidae) in the Humboldt Current System<\/b><br><br>During the late Pleistocene-Holocene, the Humboldt Current System (HCS, Peru-Chile) was subject to important oceanographic variations that may have affected the abundance and distribution of marine populations, as well as their genetic structure and diversity. The fast growth and short life span of jumbo squid Dosidicus gigas make this squid a valuable model organism for evaluating how environmental fluctuations affect the genetic diversity of marine populations. We sequenced a 657 bp fragment of the mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene of 169 jumbo squids from 6 locations in the HCS. We measured and compared genetic diversity among localities and performed neutrality tests to detect deviation from mutation-drift equilibrium. We inferred the demographic history of jumbo squids using Bayesian skyline analyses to estimate effective population size through time. A total of 23 haplotypes were found among the sequences. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity were low in all locations. D. gigas was characterized by an absence of population genetic structure and a star-like haplotype network. Neutrality test values were negative and statistically significant, and therefore consistent with a past population expansion. Similarly, Bayesian skyline analyses indicated a recent demographic expansion after the last glacial maximum. Our results suggest that D. gigas consists of a single, large population in the HCS, that may have experienced a dramatic demographic popu lation expansion consistent with the oceanographic changes associated with the last glacial- interglacial transition. © Inter-Research 2011.","<b>Dissecting Genetic Structure in Farmer Selections of Theobroma Cacao in the Peruvian Amazon: Implications for on Farm Conservation and Rehabilitation<\/b><br><br>Knowledge of genetic diversity in farmers' selections is essential for planning on-farm conservation and rehabilitation. Using 15 microsatellite loci, we analyzed parentage and population structure in 220 farmer selections of cacao from the Huallaga valley in Peruvian Amazon. A high level of allele richness and heterozygosity were detected in these selections. Coordination analysis showed that these farmer selections are mainly comprised of hybrids derived from Trinitario and Upper Amazon Forastero germplasm. Bayesian clustering analysis assigned 54 selections as Trinitario and 166 as Upper Amazon Forastero hybrids. Parentage analysis identified 15 international clones as probable parents for 96 farmer selections, which corresponded to a fraction of the known hybrid families disseminated in this region in the late 1980s. Combined analysis of demographic and molecular data revealed a significant spatial autocorrelation (r = 0.235; P = 0.006) at short geographical distances (>5. 0 km). This patch-like distribution of spatial heterogeneity suggests a significant \"neighborhood effects\" in seeds distribution or variety adoption, where closely related hybrid progenies were adopted in the neighboring farms or villages. The outcomes of this study indicate that in spite of the introgressions of exotic germplasm in the past, Upper Amazon Forastero is still the dominant component in the Huallaga valley of Peru. The high level of on-farm diversity can offer needed variability for participatory selection of superior clones in this low input, small-scale production system, where adaptability to specific environment is more preferred than in a high input, large scale production system. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).","<b>True versus apparent Malaria infection prevalence: The contribution of a Bayesian approach<\/b><br><br>Aims: To present a new approach for estimating the \"true prevalence\" of malaria and apply it to datasets from Peru, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Methods: Bayesian models were developed for estimating both the malaria prevalence using different diagnostic tests (microscopy, PCR & ELISA), without the need of a gold standard, and the tests' characteristics. Several sources of information, i.e. data, expert opinions and other sources of knowledge can be integrated into the model. This approach resulting in an optimal and harmonized estimate of malaria infection prevalence, with no conflict between the different sources of information, was tested on data from Peru, Vietnam and Cambodia. Results: Malaria sero-prevalence was relatively low in all sites, with ELISA showing the highest estimates. The sensitivity of microscopy and ELISA were statistically lower in Vietnam than in the other sites. Similarly, the specificities of microscopy, ELISA and PCR were significantly lower in Vietnam than in the other sites. In Vietnam and Peru, microscopy was closer to the \"true\" estimate than the other 2 tests while as expected ELISA, with its lower specificity, usually overestimated the prevalence. Conclusions: Bayesian methods are useful for analyzing prevalence results when no gold standard diagnostic test is available. Though some results are expected, e.g. PCR more sensitive than microscopy, a standardized and context-independent quantification of the diagnostic tests' characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) and the underlying malaria prevalence may be useful for comparing different sites. Indeed, the use of a single diagnostic technique could strongly bias the prevalence estimation. This limitation can be circumvented by using a Bayesian framework taking into account the imperfect characteristics of the currently available diagnostic tests. As discussed in the paper, this approach may further support global malaria burden estimation initiatives. © 2011 Speybroeck et al.","<b>A history of Chagas disease transmission, control, and re-emergence in peri-rural La Joya, Peru<\/b><br><br>Background:The history of Chagas disease control in Peru and many other nations is marked by scattered and poorly documented vector control campaigns. The complexities of human migration and sporadic control campaigns complicate evaluation of the burden of Chagas disease and dynamics of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission.Methodology/Principal Findings:We conducted a cross-sectional serological and entomological study to evaluate temporal and spatial patterns of T. cruzi transmission in a peri-rural region of La Joya, Peru. We use a multivariate catalytic model and Bayesian methods to estimate incidence of infection over time and thereby elucidate the complex history of transmission in the area. Of 1,333 study participants, 101 (7.6%; 95% CI: 6.2-9.0%) were confirmed T. cruzi seropositive. Spatial clustering of parasitic infection was found in vector insects, but not in human cases. Expanded catalytic models suggest that transmission was interrupted in the study area in 1996 (95% credible interval: 1991-2000), with a resultant decline in the average annual incidence of infection from 0.9% (95% credible interval: 0.6-1.3%) to 0.1% (95% credible interval: 0.005-0.3%). Through a search of archival newspaper reports, we uncovered documentation of a 1995 vector control campaign, and thereby independently validated the model estimates.Conclusions/Significance:High levels of T. cruzi transmission had been ongoing in peri-rural La Joya prior to interruption of parasite transmission through a little-documented vector control campaign in 1995. Despite the efficacy of the 1995 control campaign, T. cruzi was rapidly reemerging in vector populations in La Joya, emphasizing the need for continuing surveillance and control at the rural-urban interface.","<b>Shark tales: A molecular species-level phylogeny of sharks (Selachimorpha, Chondrichthyes)<\/b><br><br>Sharks are a diverse and ecologically important group, including some of the ocean's largest predatory animals. Sharks are also commercially important, with many species suffering overexploitation and facing extinction. However, despite a long evolutionary history, commercial, and conservation importance, phylogenetic relationships within the sharks are poorly understood. To date, most studies have either focused on smaller clades within sharks, or sampled taxa sparsely across the group. A more detailed species-level phylogeny will offer further insights into shark taxonomy, provide a tool for comparative analyses, as well as facilitating phylogenetic estimates of conservation priorities. We used four mitochondrial and one nuclear gene to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of 229 species (all eight Orders and 31 families) of sharks, more than quadrupling the number of taxon sampled in any prior study. The resulting Bayesian phylogenetic hypothesis agrees with prior studies on the major relationships of the sharks phylogeny; however, on those relationships that have proven more controversial, it differs in several aspects from the most recent molecular studies. The phylogeny supports the division of sharks into two major groups, the Galeomorphii and Squalimorphii, rejecting the hypnosqualean hypothesis that places batoids within sharks. Within the squalimorphs the orders Hexanchiformes, Squatiniformes, Squaliformes, and Pristiophoriformes are broadly monophyletic, with minor exceptions apparently due to missing data. Similarly, within Galeomorphs, the orders Heterodontiformes, Lamniformes, Carcharhiniformes, and Orectolobiformes are broadly monophyletic, with a couple of species 'misplaced'. In contrast, many of the currently recognized shark families are not monophyletic according to our results. Our phylogeny offers some of the first clarification of the relationships among families of the order Squaliformes, a group that has thus far received relatively little phylogenetic attention. Our results suggest that the genus Echinorhinus is not a squaliform, but rather related to the saw sharks, a hypothesis that might be supported by both groups sharing 'spiny' snouts. In sum, our results offer the most detailed species-level phylogeny of sharks to date and a tool for comparative analyses. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Assessing the geographic range of Black-fronted Ground-Tyrants (Muscisaxicola frontalis) using extralimital and winter range occurrence records and ecological niche modeling<\/b><br><br>Estimating the geographic range of a species can be complicated by insufficient occurrence data and a lack of information about range limit determinants. Accurate estimates of species distributions are needed to assess the impacts of anthropogenic actions and for exploring evolutionary and ecological processes that maintain biological diversity. After documenting several extralimital locations for Black-fronted Ground-Tyrants (Muscisaxicola frontalis; Tyrannidae), we questioned the accuracy of the current winter range estimate. We provide specimen and observation records from central and southern Peru that represent new information about the winter distribution of Black-fronted Ground-Tyrants. We used ecological niche models generated from new extralimital records and records from the winter range to assess the current range estimate. We also tested winter and extralimital niche models for model equivalency using a resampling technique available through Maxent and ENM Tools. Niche models developed with locations from the winter range predicted with high probability (>90%) the area of the extralimital records. Reciprocally, niche models developed with the extralimital locations predicted the majority of the winter range locations, although the probability was lower for some locations and the most southerly points were not included in the prediction. The test for model equivalency did not distinguish the two models, suggesting the possibility that the extralimital records were from poorly sampled areas of the true winter range. Smaller scale habitat associations of Black-fronted Ground-Tyrants, such as a preference for sparsely vegetated slopes, were documented that were more specific than published accounts.

We estimated dates of origin and diversification for major clades, and performed a biogeographic analysis using a dispersal-vicariance framework, in order to infer a scenario of the biogeographical history of the group. We found long-branch taxa that affected the accuracy of all three methods. Moreover, different methods produced incongruent phylogenies. We found that Satyrini appeared around 42 Mya in either the Neotropical or the Eastern Palaearctic, Oriental, and/or Indo-Australian regions, and underwent a quick radiation between 32 and 24 Mya, during which time most of its component subtribes originated. Several factors might have been important for the diversification of Satyrini: the ability to feed on grasses; early habitat shift into open, non-forest habitats; and geographic bridges, which permitted dispersal over marine barriers, enabling the geographic expansions of ancestors to new environments that provided opportunities for geographic differentiation, and diversification.'To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail'.

Suture zones, narrow regions where multiple contact zones and hybrid zones between taxa cluster, have been seen as evidence for past expansion of whole biotas that have undergone allopatric divergence in vicariant refuges. We used coalescent analysis of mutilocus sequence data to examine population split times in 22 pairs of geminate taxa in ithomiine and heliconiine butterflies. We test a hypothesis of simultaneous divergence across a suture zone in NE Peru. Our results reveal a scattered time course of diversification in this suture zone, rather than a tight cluster of split times. Additionally, we find rapid diversification within some lineages such as Melinaea contrasting with older divergence within lineages such as the Oleriina (Hyposcada and Oleria). These results strongly reject simple vicariance as a cause of the suture zone. At the same time, observed lineage effects are incompatible with a series of geographically coincident vicariant events which should affect all lineages similarly. Our results suggest that Pleistocene climatic forcing cannot readily explain this Peruvian suture zone. Lineage-specific biological traits, such as characteristic distances of gene flow or varying rates of parapatric divergence, may be of greater importance. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","<b>Are rapids a barrier for floodplain fishes of the Amazon basin?

Peru is one of the Latin American countries with the highest malaria burden, mainly due to Plasmodium vivax infections. However, little is known about P. vivax transmission dynamics in the Peruvian Amazon, where most malaria cases occur. The genetic diversity and population structure of P. vivax isolates collected in different communities around Iquitos city, the capital of the Peruvian Amazon, was determined. Methods. Plasmodium vivax population structure was determined by multilocus genotyping with 16 microsatellites on 159 P. vivax infected blood samples (mono-infections) collected in four sites around Iquitos city. The population characteristics were assessed only in samples with monoclonal infections (n = 94), and the genetic diversity was determined by calculating the expected heterozygosity and allelic richness. Both linkage disequilibrium and the genetic differentiation () were estimated. Results. The proportion of polyclonal infections varied substantially by site (11% - 70%), with the expected heterozygosity ranging between 0.44 and 0.69; no haplotypes were shared between the different populations. Linkage disequilibrium was present in all populations (IAS 0.14 - 0.61) but was higher in those with fewer polyclonal infections, suggesting inbreeding and a clonal population structure. Strong population differentiation ( = 0.45) was found and the Bayesian inference cluster analysis identified six clusters based on distinctive allele frequencies. Conclusion. The P. vivax populations circulating in the Peruvian Amazon basin are genetically diverse, strongly differentiated and they have a low effective recombination rate. These results are in line with the low and clustered pattern of malaria transmission observed in the region around Iquitos city. © 2010 Van den Eede et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","<b>Phylogenetics of Coenonymphina (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae) and the problem of rooting rapid radiations<\/b><br><br>We report a rapid radiation of a group of butterflies within the family Nymphalidae and examine some aspects of popular analytical methods in dealing with rapid radiations. We attempted to infer the phylogeny of butterflies belonging to the subtribe Coenonymphina sensu lato using five genes (4398 bp) with Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analyses. Initial analyses suggested that the group has undergone rapid speciation within Australasia. We further analyzed the dataset with different outgroup combinations the choice of which had a profound effect on relationships within the ingroup. Modelling methods recovered Coenonymphina as a monophyletic group to the exclusion of Zipaetis and Orsotriaena, irrespective of outgroup combination. Maximum Parsimony occasionally returned a polyphyletic Coenonymphina, with Argyronympha grouping with outgroups, but this was strongly dependent on the outgroups used. We analyzed the ingroup without any outgroups and found that the relationships inferred among taxa were different from those inferred when either of the outgroup combinations was used, and this was true for all methods. We also tested whether a hard polytomy is a better hypothesis to explain our dataset, but could not find conclusive evidence. We therefore conclude that the major lineages within Coenonymphina form a near-hard polytomy with regard to each other. The study highlights the importance of testing different outgroups rather than using results from a single outgroup combination of a few taxa, particularly in difficult cases where basal nodes appear to receive low support. We provide a revised classification of Coenonymphina; Zipaetis and Orsotriaena are transferred to the tribe Eritina. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Bayesian estimation of the logistic positive exponent irt model<\/b><br><br>A Bayesian inference approach using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is developed for the logistic positive exponent (LPE) model proposed by Samejima and for a new skewed Logistic Item Response Theory (IRT) model, named Reflection LPE model. Both models lead to asymmetric item characteristic curves (ICC) and can be appropriate because a symmetric ICC treats both correct and incorrect answers symmetrically, which results in a logical contradiction in ordering examinees on the ability scale. A data set corresponding to a mathematical test applied in Peruvian public schools is analyzed, where comparisons with other parametric IRT models also are conducted. Several model comparison criteria are discussed and implemented. The main conclusion is that the LPE and RLPE IRT models are easy to implement and seem to provide the best fit to the data set considered. © 2010 AERA.","<b>A framework for skew-probit links in binary regression<\/b><br><br>We review several asymmetrical links for binary regression models and present a unified approach for two skew-probit links proposed in the literature. Moreover, under skew-probit link, conditions for the existence of the ML estimators and the posterior distribution under improper priors are established. The framework proposed here considers two sets of latent variables which are helpful to implement the Bayesian MCMC approach. A simulation study to criteria for models comparison is conducted and two applications are made. Using different Bayesian criteria we show that, for these data sets, the skew-probit links are better than alternative links proposed in the literature.","<b>Evolutionary position of Peruvian land snails (Orthalicidae) among Stylommatophora (Mollusca: Gastropoda)<\/b><br><br>The genera Bostryx and Scutalus (Orthalicidae: Bulimulinae) are endemics from South America. They are mainly distributed on the western slopes of the Peruvian Andes. The goal of the present work was to assess their evolutionary position among the stylommatophoran gastropods based on the 16S rRNA mitochondrial marker. Four sequences were obtained, and along with 28 sequences of other Stylommatophora retrieved from the GenBank, were aligned with ClustalX. The phylogenetic reconstruction was carried out using the methods of Neighbor-Joining, Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference. The multiple sequence alignment had 371 sites, with indels. The two genera of the family Orthalicidae for the first time included in a molecular phylogeny (Bostryx and Scutalus), formed a monophyletic group along with another member of the superfamily Orthalicoidea (Placostylus), result that is comparable with that obtained with nuclear markers. Their evolutionary relationship with other land snails is also discussed. © 2009 Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas UNMSM.","<b>Molecular phylogeny of the genus Pseudoplatystoma (Bleeker, 1862): Biogeographic and evolutionary implications<\/b><br><br>empty","<b>A robust Bayesian approach to null intercept measurement error model with application to dental data<\/b><br><br>Measurement error models often arise in epidemiological and clinical research. Usually, in this set up it is assumed that the latent variable has a normal distribution. However, the normality assumption may not be always correct. Skew-normal/independent distribution is a class of asymmetric thick-tailed distributions which includes the skew-normal distribution as a special case. In this paper, we explore the use of skew-normal/independent distribution as a robust alternative to null intercept measurement error model under a Bayesian paradigm. We assume that the random errors and the unobserved value of the covariate (latent variable) follows jointly a skew-normal/independent distribution, providing an appealing robust alternative to the routine use of symmetric normal distribution in this type of model. Specific distributions examined include univariate and multivariate versions of the skew-normal distribution, the skew-t distributions, the skew-slash distributions and the skew contaminated normal distributions. The methods developed is illustrated using a real data set from a dental clinical trial. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Previous work suggests there may be more than one subspecies, highlighting the need for further study. Here, we combine traditional and geometric morphometric analysis of skull shape and size with genetic data to compare two populations of South American fur seals, one from Uruguay and one from Peru. As a control group we used material from the closely related species Arctocephalus gazella. Both techniques of morphometric analysis reveal pronounced geographic variation in size and shape of the skull, with Peruvian specimens (n = 102) being larger than Uruguayan skulls (n = 133) and significant shape differences concentrated in the rostral region. Similarly, seven highly polymorphic microsatellite loci reveal highly significant differences in allele frequency. Moreover, Bayesian analysis implemented using the program structure reveals two separate clusters corresponding perfectly to the two populations, with an assignment test correctly placing over 98% of specimens in their population of origin. This degree of differentiation for both genetic and morphological traits suggests complete and possibly prolonged isolation to the extent that we believe these populations should be considered distinct evolutionarily significant units. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","<b>HLA-driven convergence of HIV-1 viral subtypes B and F toward the adaptation to immune responses in human populations<\/b><br><br>Background: Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte (CTL) response drives the evolution of HIV-1 at a host-level by selecting HLA-restricted escape mutations. Dissecting the dynamics of these escape mutations at a population-level would help to understand how HLA-mediated selection drives the evolution of HIV-1. Methodology/Principal Findings: We undertook a study of the dynamics of HIV-1 CTL-escape mutations by analyzing through statistical approaches and phylogenetic methods the viral gene gag sequenced in plasma samples collected between the years 1987 and 2006 from 302 drug-naïve HIV-positive patients. By applying logistic regression models and after performing correction for multiple test, we identified 22 potential CTL-escape mutations (p-value<0.05; q-value<0.2); 10 of these associations were confirmed in samples biologically independent by a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method. Analyzing their prevalence back in time we found that escape mutations that are the consensus residue in samples collected after 2003 have actually significantly increased in time in one of either B or F subtype until becoming the most frequent residue, while dominating the other viral subtype. Their estimated prevalence in the viral subtype they did not dominate was lower than 30% for the majority of samples collected at the end of the 80's. In addition, when screening the entire viral region, we found that the 75% of positions significantly changing in time (p<0.05) were located within known CTL epitopes. Conclusions: Across HIV Gag protein, the rise of polymorphisms from independent origin during the last twenty years of epidemic in our setting was related to an association with an HLA allele. The fact that these mutations accumulated in one of either B or F subtypes have also dominated the other subtype shows how this selection might be causing a convergence of viral subtypes to variants which are more likely to evade the immune response of the population where they circulate. © 2008 Dilernia et al.","<b>Predicting species distributions in poorly-studied landscapes<\/b><br><br>Conservationists are increasingly relying on distribution models to predict where species are likely to occur, especially in poorly-surveyed but biodiverse areas. Modeling is challenging in these cases because locality data necessary for model formation are often scarce and spatially imprecise. To identify methods best suited to modeling in these conditions, we compared the success of three algorithms (Maxent, Mahalanobis Typicalities and Random Forests) at predicting distributions of eight bird and eight mammal species endemic to the eastern slopes of the central Andes. We selected study species to have a range of locality sample sizes representative of the data available for endemic species of this region and also that vary in their distribution characteristics. We found that for species that are known from moderate numbers (N = 38-94) of localities, the three methods performed similarly for species with restricted distributions but Maxent and Random Forests yielded better results for species with wider distributions. For species with small numbers of sample localities (N = 5-21), Maxent produced the most consistently successful results, followed by Random Forests and then Mahalanobis Typicalities. Because evaluation statistics for models derived from few localities can be suspect due to the poor spatial representation of the evaluation data, we corroborated these results with review by scientists familiar with the species in the field. Overall, Maxent appears to be the most capable method for modeling distributions of Andean bird and mammal species because of the consistency of results in varying conditions, although the other methods have strengths in certain situations. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","<b>Dispersal, recruitment and migratory behaviour in a hawksbill sea turtle aggregation<\/b><br><br>We investigated the dispersal, recruitment and migratory behaviour of the hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), among different life-history stages and demographic segments of the large hawksbill turtle aggregation at Mona Island, Puerto Rico. There were significant differences in both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype diversity and haplotype frequencies among the adult males, females and juveniles examined, but little evidence for temporal heterogeneity within these same groups sampled across years. Consistent with previous studies and the hypothesis of strong natal homing, there were striking mtDNA haplotype differences between nesting females on Mona Island and nesting females in other major Caribbean rookeries. Breeding males also showed strong, albeit weaker, genetic evidence of natal homing. Overall, Bayesian mixed-stock analysis suggests that Mona Island was the natal rookery for 79% (65-94%) of males in the aggregation. In contrast, the Mona Island rookery accounted for only a small subset of the new juvenile recruits to the foraging grounds or in the population of older juvenile hawksbills turtles on Mona. Instead, both new recruits and the older juvenile hawksbill turtles on Mona more likely recruited from other Caribbean rookeries, suggesting that a mechanism besides natal homing must be influencing recruitment to feeding habitats. The difference in the apparent degree of natal homing behaviour among the different life-history stages of hawksbill turtles at Mona Island underscores the complexity of the species' life-history dynamics and highlights the need for both local and regional conservation efforts. © 2008 The Authors.","<b>Targeted screening strategies to detect Trypanosoma cruzi infection in children<\/b><br><br>Background: Millions of people are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease in Latin America. Anti-trypanosomal drug therapy can cure infected individuals, but treatment efficacy is highest early in infection. Vector control campaigns disrupt transmission of T. cruzi, but without timely diagnosis, children infected prior to vector control often miss the window of opportunity for effective chemotherapy. Methods and Findings: We performed a serological survey in children 2-18 years old living in a peri-urban community of Arequipa, Peru, and linked the results to entomological, spatial and census data gathered during a vector control campaign. 23 of 433 (5.3% [95% Cl 3.4-7.9]) children were confirmed seropositive for T. cruzi infection by two methods. Spatial analysis revealed that households with infected children were very tightly clustered within looser clusters of households with parasite-infected vectors. Bayesian hierarchical mixed models, which controlled for clustering of infection, showed that a child's risk of being seropositive increased by 20% per year of age and 4% per vector captured within the child's house. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plots of best-fit models suggest that more than 83% of infected children could be identified while testing only 22% of eligible children. Conclusions: We found evidence of spatially-focal vector-borne T. cruzi transmission in peri-urban Arequipa. Ongoing vector control campaigns, in addition to preventing further parasite transmission, facilitate the collection of data essential to identifying children at high risk of T. cruzi infection. Targeted screening strategies could make integration of diagnosis and treatment of children into Chagas disease control programs feasible in lower-resource settings.","<b>Rapid diversification of colouration among populations of a poison frog isolated on sky peninsulas in the central cordilleras of Peru<\/b><br><br>Aim: Comparison of Epipedobates bassleri (Myers, 1987), which occurs on high-altitude mountain ridges ('sky peninsulas') in the Andean transition zone and demonstrates high levels of divergence in colouration among populations, and Epipedobates hahneli (Schulte, 1999), which occurs throughout the lowland regions of the Amazon basin and is morphologically conserved, using phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial sequence data and comparison of colour pattern. Location: Central cordilleras of Peru (near Tarapoto, San Martin). Methods: DNA was extracted from individuals of E. bassleri from the central cordilleras of Peru, and from individuals of E. hahneli from across Peru. The cytochrome b mitochondrial gene region was amplified and sequenced for individuals of each species, and phylogenetic analysis was carried out using Bayesian inference. Genetic distances among populations and geographic distances of each species were examined and compared using Mantel tests. Parametric bootstrapping was used to test the monophyly of E. bassleri. Results: Epipedobates bassleri formed a well-supported monophyletic group and showed higher levels of genetic divergence among populations than was shown among populations of E. hahneli from the same region. Distinct clades representing different geographic regions were recovered for E. hahneli. Levels of divergence among more geographically distant populations of E. hahneli were higher than levels of divergence among E. bassleri populations. We found a significant correlation between genetic divergence and geographic distance as measured along a 1000-m contour line, but not as measured by direct routes (crossing putative biogeographical barriers). Main conclusions: Levels of genetic divergence were higher among populations of morphologically conservative E. hahneli than among populations of morphologically variable E. bassleri, suggesting rapid divergence in colouration among populations of E. bassleri. These patterns support previous arguments concerning the role of the montane transition zone between the high mountains and lowlands in divergence and speciation. High levels of both genetic and phenotypic divergence among populations of E. bassleri indicate that ecological or behavioural factors may be responsible for the high levels of colour variation seen among E. bassleri, but not among E. hahnleli, populations. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","<b>Voice2SQL: A hybrid intelligent system for the recovery of information from databases by means of spoken natural language<\/b><br><br>In this article, it is proposed a model of recovery of information from a database through queries in Natural Language using the voice as input vector. This model incorporates a Hybrid Intelligent System based on Genetic Algorithms and a Self-Organizing Map of Kohonen (SOM) to recognize the present phonemes in a word through time, which allows us to remake up a word with speaker independence. Besides, it is proposed the use of a compiler with grammar of type 2 according to the Chomsky Hierarchy to support the syntactic and semantic structure in Spanish language. Our experiments suggest that the voice and Natural Language improve notably the Human-Computer interaction regarding with traditional methods, also that it is possible to achieve a more exact recognition of words by using neural networks SOM regarding to previous approaches as Hidden Markov Models (HMM). © 2006 IEEE.","<b>A skew item response model<\/b><br><br>We introduce a new skew-probit link for item response theory (IRT) by considering an accumulated skew-normal distribution. The model extends the symmetric probitnormal IRT model by considering a new item (or skewness) parameter for the item characteristic curve. A special interpretation is given for this parameter, and a latent linear structure is indicated for the model when an augmented likelihood is considered. Bayesian MCMC inference approach is developed and an efficiency study in the estimation of the model parameters is undertaken for a data set from (Tanner 1996, pg. 190) by using the notion of effective sample size (ESS) as defined in Kass et al. (1998) and the sample size per second (ESS/s) as considered in Sahu (2002) The methodology is illustrated using a data set corresponding to a Mathematical Test applied in Peruvian schools for which a sensitivity analysis of the chosen priors is conducted and also a comparison with seven parametric IRT models is conducted. The main conclusion is that the skew-probit item response model seems to provide the best fit. © 2006 International Society for Bayesian Analysis.","<b>Genetic diversity and structure of managed and semi-natural populations of cocoa (Theobroma cacao) in the Huallaga and Ucayali valleys of Peru<\/b><br><br>• Background and Aims: Cocoa (Theobroma cacao) is indigenous to the Amazon region of South America, and it is well known that the Peruvian Amazon harbours a large number of diverse cocoa populations. A small fraction of the diversity has been collected and maintained as an ex-situ germplasm repository in Peru. However, incorrect labelling of accessions and lack of information on genetic diversity have hindered efficient conservation and use of this germplasm. This study targeted assessment of genetic diversity and population structure in a managed and a semi-natural population. • Methods: Using a capillary electrophoresis genotyping system, 105 cocoa accessions collected from the Huallaga and Ucayali valleys of Peru were fingerprinted. Based on 15 loci SSR profiles, genetic identity was examined for each accession and duplicates identified, population structure assessed and genetic diversity analysed in these two populations. • Key Results: Ten synonymous mislabelled groups were identified among the 105 accessions. The germplasm group in the Huallaga valley was clearly separated from the group in Ucayali valley by the Bayesian assignment test. The Huallaga group has lower genetic diversity, both in terms of allelic richness and of gene diversity, than the Ucayali group. Analysis of molecular variance suggested genetic substructure in the Ucayali group. Significant spatial correlation between genetic distance and geographical distances was detected in the Ucayali group by Mantel tests. • Conclusions: These results substantiate the hypothesis that the Peruvian Amazon hosts a high level of cocoa genetic diversity, and the diversity has a spatial structure. The introduction of exotic seed populations into the Peruvian Amazon is changing the cocoa germplasm spectrum in this region. The spatial structure of cocoa diversity recorded here highlights the need for additional collecting and conservation measures for natural and semi-natural cocoa populations. © 2006 The Author(s).","<b>Optimal aperture synthesis radar imaging<\/b><br><br>Aperture synthesis radar imaging has been used to investigate coherent backscatter from ionospheric plasma irregularities at Jicamarca and elsewhere for several years. Phenomena of interest include equatorial spread F, 150-km echoes, the equatorial electrojet, range-spread meteor trails, and mesospheric echoes. The sought-after images are related to spaced-receiver data mathematically through an integral transform, but direct inversion is generally impractical or suboptimal. We instead turn to statistical inverse theory, endeavoring to utilize fully all available information in the data inversion. The imaging algorithm used at Jicamarca is based on an implementation of the MaxEnt method developed for radio astronomy. Its strategy is to limit the space of candidate images to those that are positive definite, consistent with data to the degree required by experimental confidence limits; smooth (in some sense); and most representative of the class of possible solutions. The algorithm was improved recently by (1) incorporating the antenna radiation pattern in the prior probability and (2) estimating and including the full error covariance matrix in the constraints. The revised algorithm is evaluated using new 28-baseline electrojet data from Jicamarca.

Our aim is to rationalize the molecular basis of their function by studying their evolution using computational biology techniques. Phylogenetic analysis is of primary importance for classifying cognate orthologs; profile hidden Markov models (HMM) of individual subfamilies discern functionally relevant sites by conservation probability analysis; and 3-dimensional structures display the integral protein in context. The major classifications of calcium-binding proteins, viz. EF-hand, C2 and ANX, exhibit structural diversity in their HMM fingerprints at the subfamily level, with functional consequences for protein conformation, exposure of receptor interaction sites and/or binding to membrane phospholipids. Calmodulin, S100 and annexin families were characterized in Petromyzon marinus (sea lamprey) to document genome duplication and gene creation events during the key evolutionary transition to primitive vertebrates. Novel annexins from diverse organisms revealed calcium-binding domains with accessory structural features that define their unique molecular fingerprints, protein interactivity and functional specificity. These include the first single-domain, bacterial annexin in Cytophaga hutchinsonii, the 21 tetrad annexins from the unicellular protist Giardia intestinalis, an ancestor to land plant annexins from the green alga Ostreococcus lucimarinus, invertebrate octad annexins and a critical polymorphism in human ANXA7. Receptor docking models supported the hypothesis of a potential interaction between annexin and C2 domains as a propitious mechanism for ensuring membrane translocation during signal transduction. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Information on stock structure, however, is urgently needed, as the species suffers from considerable mortality due to local fishery activities throughout its distribution range. Using mitochondrial control region sequences and 11 species-specific microsatellite loci, we assessed the genetic differentiation among 118 stranded, incidentally or directly-caught Burmeister's porpoises from different localities in Peruvian, Chilean, and Argentine waters. F-statistics and Bayesian clustering analyses indicate a major population differentiation along the South American Pacific coast, separating Peruvian from both Chilean and Argentine individuals. Interestingly, this population boundary is consistent with the population structure found in another sympatrically-occurring cetacean species: the dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus). Given that vulnerability to local depletion for South American coastal porpoises and dolphins is probably highest in the Peruvian population (due to high exploitation levels and recurrent El Niño events), the genetic data reported here considerably strengthen the need for conservation efforts focused on regulation of catches in local waters. Moreover, we discuss possible genetic differentiation among Burmeister's porpoises (i) from the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean and (ii) from different Peruvian harbors. Finally, cross-species amplifications suggest that our newly-developed microsatellite markers will be useful in population genetic studies in the five other extant porpoise species. © Springer 2005.","<b>Diversity of bat-associated Leptospira in the Peruvian Amazon inferred by Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of 16s ribosomal DNA sequences<\/b><br><br>The role of bats as potential sources of transmission to humans or as maintenance hosts of leptospires is poorly understood. We quantified the prevalence of leptospiral colonization in bats in the Peruvian Amazon in the vicinity of Iquitos, an area of high biologic diversity. Of 589 analyzed bats, culture (3 of 589) and molecular evidence (20 of 589) of leptospiral colonization was found in the kidneys, yielding an overall colonization rate of 3.4%. Infection rates differed with habitat and location, and among different bat species. Bayesian analysis was used to infer phylogenic relationships of leptospiral 16S ribosomal DNA sequences. Tree topologies were consistent with groupings based on DNA-DNA hybridization studies. A diverse group of leptospires was found in peri-Iquitos bat populations including Leptospira interrogans (5 clones), L. kirschneri (1), L. borgpetersenii (4), L. fainei (1), and two previously undescribed leptospiral species (8). Although L. kirschenri and L. interrogans have been previously isolated from bats, this report is the first to describe L. borgpetersenii and L. fainei infection of bats. A wild animal reservoir of L. fainei has not been previously described. The detection in bats of the L. interrogans serovar Icterohemorrhagiae, a leptospire typically maintained by peridomestic rats, suggests a rodent-bat infection cycle. Bats in Iquitos maintain a genetically diverse group of leptospires. These results provide a solid basis for pursuing molecular epidemiologic studies of bat-associated Leptospira, a potentially new epidemiologic reservoir of transmission of leptospirosis to humans.

As an initial test, measurements have been made in the troposphere (5-10 km) and in the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) (95-105 km). Even though the EEJ irregularities are aligned with the magnetic field, i.e., only a two-dimensional approach is needed, we decided to make these observations (1) to calibrate our eight-module configuration, and (2) to study the performance of different imaging methods. These two goals are feasible, given the fact that we have a good knowledge of the EEJ's mean position, orientation, and aspect sensitivity. Four different methods have been implemented to solve for the inverse problem, i.e., to get the atmospheric brightness from the visibility samples on the ground. We used Fourier-based, Capon, and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) methods that were originally used in radar astronomy. In addition, we implemented a fitting technique where a brightness distribution, characterized by a number of anisotropic Gaussian blobs, is assumed. From the EEJ results, (1) there is good agreement between Capon and MaxEnt methods, particularly when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high, (2) under low SNR, MaxEnt works better than the other techniques, and (3) our fitting technique using two Gaussian blobs seems to work very well, but it is very sensitive to the initial parameters needed to start the fitting procedure. Finally, the tropospheric images indicate that the troposphere over Jicamarca was too homogeneous and no significant gain in information was attained by using more than three-receiving antennas, particularly when long integration times were used (>2 min). The situation could be different in a troposphere less stable than the one at Jicamarca, where the Peruvian coast temperature inversion and stability are prevalent. In the future, efforts will be made to extend the three-dimensional approach to the tropopause and lower stratosphere, where we expect to get more interesting images. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

essential aspect in the operation and expansion of the electricity infrastructure is to ensure a reliable power supply, despite uncertainty (mainly caused by random failures, variability of renewable sources, and load growth). Reliability evaluation of composite power systems is a valuable tool for identifying possible deficiencies in operation. Power systems operation is becoming more variable and stochastic. Consequently, there is an urgent need to update the tools used to analyze their reliability. This article presents a novel method based on cluster-based stratified sampling (CBSS) and sequential Monte Carlo simulations (SMCS) to improve the reliability evaluation of composite power systems. Here, clustering algorithms are applied to reduce the number of observations required by traditional SMCS. The proposed approach is applied to RTS-79, RTS-96, and RTS-GMLC electrical networks to verify its accuracy and speed. The results obtained demonstrate that CBSS increase calculation speed in highly reliable networks, while preserving information on the probability distribution of the reliability indices. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Peru is one of the world’s leading exporters of cocoa beans, which directly impacts the household economy of millions of small farmers. Currently, the expansion and modernization of the cocoa-growing area require the zoning of the territory with suitable biophysical and infrastructural conditions to facilitate optimizing productivity factors. Therefore, we analyzed land suitability for cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) production on the Peruvian mainland as a support measure for sustainable agriculture. To this end, the climatological, edaphological, orographic, and socioeconomic criteria determining sustainable cocoa cultivation were identified and mapped. Three modeling approaches (Analytic Hierarchy Process—AHP, Maximum Entropy—MaxEnt, and AHP—MaxEnt combined) were further used to hierarchize the importance of the criteria and to model the potential territory for sustainable cocoa cultivation. In all three modeling approaches, climatological criteria stood out among the five most important criteria. Elevation (orographic criteria) is also featured in this group. On the other hand, San Martin and Amazonas emerged as the five regions with the largest area ‘Highly suitable’ for cocoa cultivation in all three modeling approaches, followed by Loreto, Ucayali, Madre de Dios, Cusco, Junín, and Puno, which alternated according to modeling approach. From most to least restrictive, the AHP, MaxEnt, and AHP–MaxEnt modeling approaches indicate that 1.5%, 5.3%, and 23.0% of the Peruvian territory is ‘Highly suitable’ for cocoa cultivation, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.","Eugenia uniflora is a Brazilian native plant species with great ecological and economic importance. It is distributed throughout the Atlantic forest, where two distinct populations show local adaptation to the contrasting conditions of restinga and riparian forest. Among various TFs described in plants, the DOF TF family has been reported to affect flowering and vascular development, making them promising candidates for characterization in E. uniflora. In this study, 28 DOF genes were identified by a genome-wide analysis, of which 20 were grouped into 11 MCOGs by Bayesian phylogeny, suggesting a shared functionallity between members. Based on RNA-seq experiments, we have detected eight drought responsive genes, and SNPs identification revealed population unique polymorphisms, implying a role in local adapatation mechanisms. Finally, analysis of conserved motifs through MEME revealed 15 different protein motifs, and a promoter region analysis returned 40 enriched TF binding motifs, both reporting novel biological functions circa the DOF gene family. In general, the DOF family is found to be conserved both in sequence and expression. Furthermore, this study contributes to both DOF literature and the genetic exploration of native species, elucidating their genetic potential and bringing to light new research topics, paving the way to future studies. © 2022 by the authors.","Species distribution models (SDMs) provide conservationist with spatial distributions estimations of priority species. Lagothrix flavicauda (Humboldt, 1812), commonly known as the Yellow-tailed Woolly Monkey, is one of the largest primates in the New World. This species is endemic to the montane forests of northern Peru, in the departments of Amazonas, San Martín, Huánuco, Junín, La Libertad, and Loreto at elevation from1,000 to 2,800 m. It is classified as “Critically Endangered” (CR) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as well as by Peruvian legislation. Furthermore, it is listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Research on precise estimates of its potential distribution are scare. Therefore, in this study we modeled the potential distribution area of this species in Peru, the model was generated using the MaxEnt algorithm, along with 80 georeferenced occurrence records and 28 environmental variables. The total distribution (high, moderate, and low) for L. flavicauda is 29,383.3 km2, having 3,480.7 km2 as high potential distribution. In effect, 22.64 % (6,648.49 km2) of the total distribution area of L. flavicauda is found within Natural Protected Areas (NPAs), with the following categories representing the largest areas of distribution: Protected Forests (1,620.41 km2), Regional Conservation Areas (1,976.79 km2), and Private Conservation Areas (1,166.55 km2). After comparing the predicted distribution with the current NPAs system, we identified new priority areas for the conservation of the species. We, therefore, believe that this study will contribute significantly to the conservation of L. flavicauda in Peru. © 2022","Background: The composite coverage index (CCI) provides an integrated perspective towards universal health coverage in the context of reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health. Given the sample design of most household surveys does not provide coverage estimates below the first administrative level, approaches for achieving more granular estimates are needed. We used a model-based geostatistical approach to estimate the CCI at multiple resolutions in Peru. Methods: We generated estimates for the eight indicators on which the CCI is based for the departments, provinces, and areas of 5 × 5 km of Peru using data from two national household surveys carried out in 2018 and 2019 plus geospatial covariates. Bayesian geostatistical models were fit using the INLA-SPDE approach. We assessed model fit using cross-validation at the survey cluster level and by comparing modelled and direct survey estimates at the department-level. Results: CCI coverage in the provinces along the coast was consistently higher than in the remainder of the country. Jungle areas in the north and east presented the lowest coverage levels and the largest gaps between and within provinces. The greatest inequalities were found, unsurprisingly, in the largest provinces where populations are scattered in jungle territory and are difficult to reach. Conclusions: Our study highlighted provinces with high levels of inequality in CCI coverage indicating areas, mostly low-populated jungle areas, where more attention is needed. We also uncovered other areas, such as the border with Bolivia, where coverage is lower than the coastal provinces and should receive increased efforts. More generally, our results make the case for high-resolution estimates to unveil geographic inequities otherwise hidden by the usual levels of survey representativeness. © 2022, The Author(s).","Peru is a megadiverse country in neotropical flora and is home to an important genus of plants called Cinchona and commonly all its individual species are called Cinchona Tree (Cinchona spp.), which represents the national tree for this nation. This country has 18 species, a group of these species are listed as vulnerable, endangered, and their population trend is currently unknown. This genus is at risk of extinction due to overexploitation for its medicinal, constructive and food uses. The IUCN also mentions that increased species assessments and records will help make the IUCN Red List a “barometer of life”. Based on the fact that understanding the effects of environmental change on ecosystems requires the identification of historical and current baselines, which can act as reference conditions, this research generated georeferenced global historical maps of Cinchona spp. and then determined the appropriate sites based on environmental variables using the MaxEnt software and established the probabilities of occurrence of this genus in Peru to establish priority areas for its conservation and restoration. Four maps were obtained, one for each centennial, from 1737 to the present, with 10 860 occurrences of Cinchona. In the MaxEnt modeling, 10.30 % (13 3172.56 km2) and 19.20 % (24 7371.32 km2) of Peru's surface area had high ( > 0.6) and moderate (0.4–0.6) probabilities, respectively, of hosting Cinchona. Only 7.6 % (17 305.32 km2) and 22.0 % (50 153.73 km2) of the areas with high and moderate distribution potential, respectively, were covered by natural protected areas. Likewise, 11.90 % (21 738.75 km2) and 33.20 % (60 789.17 km2) of the high and moderate probability lands, respectively, correspond to degraded areas (DAs) and, therefore, are considered a priority for restoration with Cinchona spp. The results may stimulate the rethinking of decision making for the National Action Plan for Reforestation with Species of the Genus Cinchona and other plans or tools for Cinchona conservation in Peru. © 2022 The Author(s)","Bounded continuous data are encountered in many applications of item response theory, including the measurement of mood, personality, and response times and in the analyses of summed item scores. Although different item response theory models exist to analyze such bounded continuous data, most models assume the data to be in an open interval and cannot accommodate data in a closed interval. As a result, ad hoc transformations are needed to prevent scores on the bounds of the observed variables. To motivate the present study, we demonstrate in real and simulated data that this practice of fitting open interval models to closed interval data can majorly affect parameter estimates even in cases with only 5% of the responses on one of the bounds of the observed variables. To address this problem, we propose a zero and one inflated item response theory modeling framework for bounded continuous responses in the closed interval. We illustrate how four existing models for bounded responses from the literature can be accommodated in the framework. The resulting zero and one inflated item response theory models are studied in a simulation study and a real data application to investigate parameter recovery, model fit, and the consequences of fitting the incorrect distribution to the data. We find that neglecting the bounded nature of the data biases parameters and that misspecification of the exact distribution may affect the results depending on the data generating model. © 2022 The Author(s).","Highly mobile odontocetes need habitats with environmental conditions with the potential of aggregating enough and high-quality prey, to maximize foraging success. Until now, the characterization of those habitats was in terms of physical and biological indicators of high production, capable of attracting and sustaining prey. Nevertheless, there has been no approach to quantifying the effects of a biophysical characteristic of the ocean with proven effects on the vertical distribution of prey for cetaceans: The oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) depth. In the northern branch of the Humboldt Current System off Peru (~6-18° S), a shallow OMZ (30-50 m) affects the distribution of the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens), main prey for several marine predators, including dolphins. We hypothesized these predators would aggregate in productive areas, but with preference for places where the relative OMZ depth can constrain prey vertically, making it more accessible and maximizing foraging success. We fitted Bayesian habitat models for three dominant odontocete species in this region, with multiple combinations of environmental covariates, smoothing techniques, and temporal and spatial random effects. Cetacean data came from 23 dedicated surveys spanning 2001-2019. Habitat predictors included the spatial anomalies of sea surface temperature, surface chlorophyl-a, pycnocline depth and OMZ depth. Dusky (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) and common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) preferred productive, cold areas with a very shallow OMZ, regardless of the season, while bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) aggregated in both cold and warm waters, also with shallow OMZ. The former two species of higher metabolic demands would maximize energy intake by selecting areas with highly aggregated prey, while the latter, of more moderate metabolic needs and more diverse prey, would exploit less restricted habitats.

The low genetic diversity observed in the Chilean populations has been associated with the over-exploitation of natural beds and/or the founder effect that occurred during post-glacial colonization from New Zealand. How these processes have affected its evolutionary trajectory before farming and incipient domestication is poorly understood. In this study, we used 2232 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to assess how the species' evolutionary history in New Zealand (its region of origin), the founder effect linked to transoceanic dispersion and colonization of South America, and the recent over-exploitation of natural populations have influenced the genetic architecture of G. chilensis in Chile. The contrasting patterns of genetic diversity and structure observed between the two main islands in New Zealand attest to the important effects of Quaternary glacial cycles on G. chilensis. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) analyses indicated that Chatham Island and South America were colonized independently near the end of the Last Glacial Maximum and emphasized the importance of coastal and oceanic currents during that period. Furthermore, ABC analyses inferred the existence of a recent and strong genetic bottleneck in Chile, matching the period of over-exploitation of the natural beds during the 1970s, followed by rapid demographic expansion linked to active clonal propagation used in farming. Recurrent genetic bottlenecks strongly eroded the genetic diversity of G. chilensis prior to its cultivation, raising important challenges for the management of genetic resources in this incipiently domesticated species. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Telmatobius is the most diverse group of anurans in the Andean Altiplano (highlands) Morphologically, these amphibians have a generally conserved morphology but in turn present large intraspecific variation, which has led to a complex taxonomy and systematics. T. marmoratus has the widest distribution of the genus and forms a complex composed of at least two Telmatobius species. Partial systematic studies based on molecular evidence reveal the existence of three lineages with a complex spatial distribution. However, these studies did not include the entire distribution of T. marmoratus. Our study aims to reassess the current systematic scenario including the complete distribution of the complex. For this, we used a multilocus approach based on mitochondrial (16S, Cytb) and nuclear (RAG1-1, BFIB) DNA sequences to build a phylogenetic hypothesis based on Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony. Subsequently, we performed single-locus (ABGD and PTP) and multilocus (STACEY) species delimitation analyses to verify the diversity of nominal species within the complex. The analyses suggest seven non-sibling lineages and 6–10 candidate species within the marmoratus complex. Only one of the two lineages restricted to the central northern plateau correspond to T. marmoratus sensu stricto. South-central marbled water frogs belong to completely new lineages closer to T. gigas and T. culeus, evidencing the polyphyletic condition of the marmoratus complex. The findings of several sympatric lineages in some localities reveal a complex history of ancient water connections in south-central Altiplano. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Regression models with probit and logit link functions are the most frequently used for binary response variables. However, traditional approaches may not be adequate when data are unbalanced. This paper deals with standard skew-probit regression models. Parameters were estimated through a new Bayesian approach which consists of the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and the original likelihood function. Simulation studies assessed the efficiency of the estimation method and the sensitivity of prior distributions for parameters related to asymmetry calculating the RMSE (root mean square error). The proposed estimation method was compared when used for detecting outliers. The results show that the proposed method is more efficient than INLA and is successful in the recovery of true parameter values. The sensitivity study enabled the proposal of a new prior distribution configuration for the asymmetry parameter, and the randomized quantile residual proved to be more suitable for detecting outliers. The methodology was applied to a diabetes dataset towards illustrating the results. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2022.","The present-day population structure of a species reflects the combination of oceanographic currents, life-history traits, and historical events. However, little is known about the mechanisms that have shaped the gene lineage distribution of marine species inhabiting the Southeast Pacific. Here, we provide a comprehensive phylogeographical study of a species distributed along the Southeast Pacific coastal region by analyzing the endemic gastropod Thaisella chocolata (Duclos, 1832). Sequencing of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) and 16S rRNA revealed strikingly high haplotypic nucleotide and genetic diversity but a lack of significant population differentiation within the survey area. In addition, a star-shaped phylogeny and significantly negative Tajima's D and Fu's Fs tests of neutrality suggested historical occurrence of rapid demographic expansion. Mismatch distributions and Bayesian inference analyses also confirmed T. chocolata to have undergone two ancestral demographic expansions. Calculations suggested that these expansions began in the lower and middle Pleistocene epoch, likely due to continental shelf development and climatic conditions. These findings could help establish a genetic baseline for T. chocolata as the first step toward sustainable spatial management of this species, as well as understand this species’ response to future climate change. © 2022 The Authors.

In this study, we found six additional species of host plants for D. (A.) dodona belonging to the genus Malesherbia (Passifloraceae). We used mitochondrial DNA sequences (COI) and microsatellites to screen genetic variation and investigate population structure in six geographic disjointed populations of D. (A.) dodona associated with distinct Malesherbia species. The PCoA analysis based on allele frequencies evidenced a lack of differentiation among populations and a low FST. The Bayesian cluster analyses revealed the existence of three genetically distinct groups, but almost all individuals present an admixture ancestry. An absence of isolation by distance pattern was observed. Possible scenarios are discussed: a bottleneck or recent colonization from interconnected populations from the south, and ongoing gene flow among local populations by high dispersal through a landscape formed of isolated populations of Malesherbia. © 2022 by the authors.","The objective of this research was to analyze the relationship between social support and resilience with prosocial behavior before and during the confinement caused by COVID-19. Materials and Methods: The participants were divided into a confined group (228 women and 84 men) and an unconfined group (153 women and 105 men), all of whom were university students. Instruments were applied to measure the variables proposed. Results: Social support predicted 24.4% of the variance in prosocial behavior among women and 12% among men in the confined group; no evidence of this relationship was found in the unconfined groups. Resilience predicted 7% of the variance in prosocial behavior among confined women, 8.4% among confined men, 8.8% among unconfined women, and 5.1% in unconfined men. Discussion and Conclusion: The results show the importance of social support and resilience in prosocial behaviors, which are key elements for the proper functioning of society, especially in the face of a crisis such as COVID-19. © 2022 by the authors.","The spread of non-native fish species is increasing globally and threatening aquatic ecosystems. Identifying the origins, the pathways, and vectors is crucial for managing biological invasions. We conducted a genetic characterization of Arapaima gigas from the Madeira River, considering native and non-native populations, to elucidate the invasion of the upper and middle Madeira River basin by A. gigas. We analyzed 9 microsatellite loci of 141 individuals from native (lower Madeira) and invasive (upper Madeira) populations, in addition to a locality from Peru outside the Madeira River basin drainage area, that previously was suggested to be one of the possible origins of the invasion. The results of discriminant analysis of principal components, Bayesian modeling of population structure, clustering and assignment tests (using microsatellite data from other Amazon locations) showed a clear separation between native and invasive populations and revealed a mixture of individuals from upper and middle Madeira and Peru. We confirm that the invasive population originates from Peru and was introduced by fish escapees from farms. Multiple secondary introductions may have advanced the invasion speed. Such a scenario represents a conservation paradox, because in its native habitat, A. gigas is endangered, whereas it has become invasive in non-native areas. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","The chromosphere is a highly dynamic outer plasma layer of the Sun. Its physical processes accounting for the variability are poorly understood. We reconstructed the solar chromospheric flare index (SFI) to study the solar chromospheric variability from 1937 to 2020. The new SFI database is a composite record of the Astronomical Institute Ondřejov Observatory of the Czech Academy of Sciences from 1937 – 1976 and the records of the Kandilli Observatory of Istanbul, Turkey from 1977 – 2020. The SFI records are available in daily, monthly, and yearly resolutions. We carried out the time-frequency analyses of the new 84-year long SFI records using the wavelet transform. We report the periodicities of 21.88 (Hale cycle), 10.94 (Schwabe cycle), 5.2 (quasi-quinquennial cycle), 3.5, 1.7, 1, 0.41 (or 149.7 days, Rieger cycle), 0.17 (62.1 days), 0.07 (25.9 days, solar rotational modulation) years. All these periodicities seem always present and persistent throughout the observational interval. Thus, we suggest that there is no reason to assume these solar periodicities are absent from other solar cycles. Time variations of the amplitude of each oscillation or periodicity were also studied using the inverse wavelet transform. We found that for the SFI the most active flare cycles over the record were Cycles 17, 19, and 21, while Cycles 20, 22, 23, and 24 were the weakest ones with Cycle 18 was intermediate in flare activity. This shows several differences to the equivalent relationships for solar activity implied by sunspot number records. Furthermore, this confirms that solar activity trends and variability in the chromosphere as captured by SFI are not necessarily the same as those of the Sun’s photosphere, as implied by the sunspot number activity records, for instance. We have also introduced a new signal/noise wavelet coherence metric to analyze two different chromospheric indices available (i.e. the SFI and the disk-integrated chromospheric Ca ii K activity indices) and to quantify the differences and similarities of the oscillations within the solar chromosphere. Our findings suggest the importance of carrying out additional co-analyses with other solar activity records to find physical inter-relations and connections between the different solar layers from the photosphere, the chromosphere to the corona. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Accurate prediction of machine tool wear is an essential part of modern and efficient manufacturing. In recent years, many studies have been carried out using machine learning algorithms, both traditional and deep learning; with the latter ones reporting the highest precisions. The present work aims to show that, in the tool wear prediction problem, traditional methods can have a performance similar to the state of the art, obtained using deep learning methods. The data used here is presented in the form of time series, which cannot be used directly by traditional machine learning algorithms, such as the ones used in this work. To link the raw data and the learning algorithm, it is first necessary to extract a set of features from the time series. In addition, some preprocessing techniques, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization and forward feature selection are applied. In this work, two freely accessible databases are used with two different but related objectives, the first is used to predict machine tool wear, while the second is used to predict the remaining useful life of machine tools. For the first case, errors (RMSE) of less than 10 were obtained, while in the second case scores above 85% were achieved. In both cases, these results are comparable to the state of the art. Using the methodology presented here makes it possible to obtain very accurate tool wear predictions at a lower computational cost, both due to the use of less complex models and to a reduced set of features. © 2021, German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP).","The impact of human population movement (HPM) on the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, has been described. However, there are limited data on the use of new technologies for the study of HPM in endemic areas with difficult access such as the Amazon. In this study conducted in rural Peruvian Amazon, we used self-reported travel surveys and GPS trackers coupled with a Bayesian spatial model to quantify the role of HPM on malaria risk. By using a densely sampled population cohort, this study highlighted the elevated malaria transmission in a riverine community of the Peruvian Amazon. We also found that the high connectivity between Amazon communities for reasons such as work, trading or family plausibly sustains such transmission levels. Finally, by using multiple human mobility metrics including GPS trackers, and adapted causal inference methods we identified for the first time the effect of human mobility patterns on malaria risk in rural Peruvian Amazon. This study provides evidence of the causal effect of HPM on malaria that may help to adapt current malaria control programmes in the Amazon. © 2022 The Authors.","The IUCN has listed the long-whiskered owlet (Xenoglaux loweryi) as vulnerable due to the presence of few geographic records, its restricted range, and anthropogenic threats. Its natural history and ecology are largely unknown, and its distribution is widely debated; therefore, there is an urgent need for the real-time conservation of X. loweryi. In this study, 66 geo-referenced records of X. loweryi, 18 environmental variables, and the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) have been used to predict the current and future (2050 and 2070) potential distribution of X. loweryi in the Amazonas and San Martin regions of northwestern Peru. In fact, under current conditions, areas of “high”, “moderate”, and “low” potential habitat suitability cover 0.16% (140.85 km2), 0.46% (416.88 km2), and 1.16% (1048.79 km2) of the study area, respectively. Moreover, under future conditions, the “high”, “moderate”, and “low” probability areas present profits and losses in terms of habitat suitability. Based on the environmental variables, this species mostly inhabits areas with a forest fraction with presence of trees with an emergent tree canopy of ~10–30 metres and depends on Yunga montane forest habitats with high humidity but it is not dependent on bare cover area, crops, or grasslands. Nevertheless, most of the current and future distribution areas are not part of the protected natural areas of Amazonas and San Martin. Additionally, the combination of climate change and anthropogenic activities contribute to further losses of this species habitat. Therefore, from the management point of view, corrective and preventive actions will help to preserve this species over time. © 2022 by the authors.","To better understand the recent internal structure of Misti volcano, we determined a 3D S-wave velocity model applying Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT). We used data from 23 broadband and short-period seismic stations temporarily installed at Misti volcano between March and December 2011. This dataset allowed us to obtain empirical Green's functions by cross-correlating seismic ambient noise signals. Then, we retrieved 104 dispersion curves using the frequency-time analysis (FTAN) and, through a non-linear multiscale inversion, we obtained nine 2-D Rayleigh waves group velocity maps for periods in the range 0.7 s - 2 s. Finally, we carried out the depth inversion through a Bayesian transdimensional inversion to obtain a 3-D S-wave velocity model down to 3 km depth. Our study highlights five relevant seismic velocity anomalies. We observed the presence of three high-velocity zones located in the west-northwest, southwest and southeast parts of the crater, that could be related to intrusive bodies possibly associated with the formation of Misti volcano. We also observed two low-velocity anomalies in the volcano's western and central parts, which coincide with previous studies' findings and are related to fractured and weakened materials associated with the external caldera collapse and recent eruption episodes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Tree diversity in Asia's tropical and subtropical forests is central to nature-based solutions. Species vulnerability to multiple threats, which affect provision of ecosystem services, is poorly understood. We conducted a region-wide, spatially explicit assessment of the vulnerability of 63 socioeconomically important tree species to overexploitation, fire, overgrazing, habitat conversion, and climate change. Trees were selected for assessment from national priority lists, and selections were validated by an expert network representing 20 countries. We used Maxent suitability modeling to predict species distribution ranges, freely accessible spatial data sets to map threat exposures, and functional traits to estimate threat sensitivities. Species-specific vulnerability maps were created as the product of exposure maps and sensitivity estimates. Based on vulnerability to current threats and climate change, we identified priority areas for conservation and restoration. Overall, 74% of the most important areas for conservation of these trees fell outside protected areas, and all species were severely threatened across an average of 47% of their native ranges. The most imminent threats were overexploitation and habitat conversion; populations were severely threatened by these factors in an average of 24% and 16% of their ranges, respectively. Our model predicted limited overall climate change impacts, although some study species were likely to lose over 15% of their habitat by 2050 due to climate change. We pinpointed specific natural areas in Borneo rain forests as hotspots for in situ conservation of forest genetic resources, more than 82% of which fell outside designated protected areas. We also identified degraded areas in Western Ghats, Indochina dry forests, and Sumatran rain forests as hotspots for restoration, where planting or assisted natural regeneration will help conserve these species, and croplands in southern India and Thailand as potentially important agroforestry options. Our results highlight the need for regionally coordinated action for effective conservation and restoration. © 2021 The Authors.

However, these models can be severely affected by outlying observations that the beta distribution does not handle well. A robust alternative to the modeling with the beta distribution is considering the rectangular beta (RB) distribution, which is an extension of the former one. The RB distribution can deal with heavy tails and is therefore more flexible than the beta distribution. Regression modeling where covariates are measured with error is a frequent issue in different areas. This paper derives robust regression modeling for proportions with errors-in-variables using the RB distribution under a new parametrization recently proposed in the literature. We use a Bayesian approach to estimate the model parameters with a specification of prior distributions and a computational implementation carried out via the Gibbs sampling. Monte Carlo simulations allow us to conduct numerical evaluation to detect the statistical performance of the approach considered. Then, an illustration with real-world data is presented to show its potential uses. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","empty","The mountain tapir Tapirus pinchaque is one of the largest and most threatened mammals of the northern South American Andes. It is distributed in montane forests and paramos mainly above 2000 m, from Colombia to north Peru. The species is categorised as globally Endangered and is mainly threatened by habitat degradation, habitat loss and fragmentation. Although up-to-date information is lacking in Peru on its distribution, population and conservation status, this population could play an important part in the global persistence of the species. We compiled all known recent occurrence records for the species from Peru, as well as data from camera traps with an effort of over 10,000 camera/days between 2016 and 2018. We modelled the tapir's distribution using remote-sensed vegetation indices, topographic and bioclimatic variables in MaxEnt, followed by post-processing steps to remove unoccupied areas, to produce a current range map for the species in Peru. We overlaid this with spatial information on threats and protected areas. We estimate a range of almost 183,000 ha in Peru, in two main regions, north and south of the Huancabamba river, of which approximately 60% is within protected areas. However, protection gaps still exist, especially in the south of its range. Mining concessions cover 27% of its current range and we estimate 28,000 ha of forest loss within its extent of occurrence between 2001 and 2020. We provide recommendations for its conservation, including priority areas for increased protection, binational initiatives to ensure connectivity with populations in Ecuador and to use the tapir as a flagship species in efforts to protect montane ecosystems for water conservation. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH","empty","Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictability and accuracy of the Short-Form Fonseca Anamnestic Index (SFAI) in relation to the modified Helkimo Index for the diagnosis of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, prospective, and analytical predictive study was conducted in 240 students of a public institute of higher technological education in Ica, Peru during the months of February to May 2018. The SFAI of 10 closed questions and the Helkimo Index modified by Maglione (gold standard) were used as instruments to diagnose TMDs. For the analysis of concordance between both instruments, Cohen's Kappa Index was applied. To evaluate the association according to gender and age group, Pearson's chi-square test was used. For validity of the SFAI in relation to accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were calculated, and they were verified by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) to determine the best cutoff points (area under the curve [AUC]) considering a P value 0.05. Regarding the predictability of the SFAI, the positive and negative predictive value was calculated by applying Bayes' theorem. Results: The SFAI was highly significantly associated with the modified Helkimo Index according to gender (P 0.001), age group (P 0.001), and overall (P 0.001) moderate overall agreement (k = 0.416; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.287-0.545); better concordance was obtained in individuals older than 20 years (k = 0.490, CI = 0.302-0.679) and women (k = 0.565, CI = 0.371-0.759). The ROC curve analysis of the SFAI showed good accuracy (0.852, CI = 0.800-0.905) and was highly significant (P 0.001), with an optimal cutoff point of 17.5 and good sensitivity (80.10%) and specificity (74.36%). In addition, a very good positive predictive value (PPV) (94.15%) and a fair negative predictive value (NPV) (42.02%) were obtained. Conclusions: Although there was moderate concordance between the SFAI and the modified Helkimo Index for the diagnosis of TMDs, the SFAI obtained good accuracy in the overall analysis of sensitivity and specificity. In addition, it demonstrated a high predictive efficacy for detecting positive TMD cases, whereas its ability to rule out positive cases was fair. © 2022 Journal of International Society of Preventive and Community Dentistry | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","The genus Proctoporus comprises cursorial and semifossorial lizards that inhabit the Andes of Argentina, Bolivia, and Peru. The taxonomy is complex, and many undescribed species and geographic gaps remain to be addressed. In this study, we use molecular phylogenetics and examine voucher museums to describe two new species of gymnophthalmid lizards from the montane forests of Cusco, on the eastern slopes of the Andes of Peru. We inferred phylogenetic relationships from concatenated sequences of four mitochondrial (12S, 16S, ND4, and Cytb) and one nuclear (c-mos) gene fragments, using a Maximum Likelihood approach and Bayesian Inference. We also examined and compared meristic traits of the specimens deposited in herpetological collections in Peru and Bolivia. Our molecular phylogeny had strong support for the monophyly of the subfamily Cercosaurinae, low support for the genus Proctoporus, and revealed two new taxa of Proctoporus. The two new species, which we name P. katerynae sp. nov. and P. optimus sp. nov., are characterized as having two rows of pregular scales and three anterior infralabials. Furthermore, we re-identified specimens assigned to P. laudahnae as P. guentheri, and we comment on the taxonomy of P. guentheri. Finally, we discuss how global climate change and human-caused habitat loss may threaten P. katerynae sp. nov. and P. optimus sp. nov. by the mechanism known as “Escalator to extinction”. © 2022 by the authors.

The main empirical results are: (i) the VAR coefficients and volatilities change more gradually than the contemporaneous coefficients over time; (ii) the volatility of MP shocks was higher under the pre-Inflation Targeting (IT) regime; (iii) a surprise increase in the interest rate produces gross domestic product (GDP) growth falls and reduces inflation in the long run; (iv) the interest rate reacts more quickly to aggregate supply shocks than to aggregate demand shocks; (v) MP shocks explain a high percentage of domestic variables behavior under the pre-IT regime but their contribution decreases under the IT regime. Overall, these results show that MP has contributed in Peru to lower macroeconomic volatility by (i) reducing average long-term inflation, (ii) increasing the response of GDP growth rate to interest rate, and (iii) by becoming more predictable.

However, there is still no consensus on the causes of their demise. Here, we use the fossil record and Bayesian diversification models to infer the origination and extinction rates for Sparassodonta. Then, we evaluate if their demise can be attributed to global temperature changes, Andean uplift, biotic interactions with their competitor and prey clades, and body mass evolution. That is biotic aspects in the context of the Red Queen model, abiotic aspects in the context of the Court Jester model, and an intrinsic lineage attribute. Our results show that this lineage is characterized by a positive near-zero net diversification rate indicating that the clade maintained a relatively low but stable diversity until the Middle Miocene when an increase in extinction rate drove them to decline and eventual extinction. Moreover, our results support the idea that a drastic regional landscape change triggered by the Andean uplift process affected their diversification dynamics, eventually driving them to extinction. These environmental changes could explicitly affect Sparassodonta lineages due to their ever-present vulnerability to extinction by near-zero net diversification rate and their highly specialized ecology that could have constrained adaptation to new South American landscapes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","empty","The phylogenetic position of the \"Upper yungas inca hocicudo\"Oxymycterus juliacae, one of the lesser-known species of the genus Oxymycterus, is still unresolved. Several authors considered it a subspecies or synonym of Oxymycterus inca, but more recently, it was recognized as a valid species based on morphometric analysis and morphological traits. The objectives of this study were then to substantiate the morphological distinction of O. juliacae and evaluate its phylogenetic position using cytochrome b sequences. We evaluated the morphology of O. juliacae and compared it with congeneric species. In addition, a Cytochrome b gene matrix was subjected to analyses of maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Our results support the morphometric and morphological distinction of O. juliacae and found that this species is more closely related to Oxymycterus willkaurco than to O. inca. Therefore, the recognition of O. juliacae as a full species is supported and a rediagnosis is provided. In addition, we found O. inca is more related to other lowland species from Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, than to central Andean species. More efforts are needed to secure genetic material of Oxymycterus species, mainly the Andean species, for a better understanding of their phylogenetic relationship. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","empty","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effects of corruption on economic growth, human development and natural resources in Latin American and Nordic countries. Design/methodology/approach: Using the hierarchical prior of Gelman et al. (2003), a Bayesian panel Vector AutoRegression (VAR) model is estimated. In addition, two alternative approaches are considered, namely, a panel error correction VAR model and an asymmetric panel VAR model. Findings: The results reveal some relevant contrasts: (1) in Latin America there is support for the sand the wheels hypothesis in Bolivia and Chile, support for the grease the wheels hypothesis in Colombia and no significant impact of corruption on growth in Brazil and Peru, while in Nordic countries the response of growth to shocks in corruption is negative in all cases; (2) corruption negatively affects human development in all countries from both regions; (3) corruption tends to spur natural resources sector in Latin American countries, while it is detrimental for natural resources sector in Nordic countries. Research limitations/implications: The panel VAR approach uses recursive scheme identification. The authors have analyzed robustness using alternative ordering of the variables. The authors also have followed two alternatives suggested by the Referee: a panel error correction VAR model and a panel asymmetric VAR model. However, another more sophisticated identification scheme could be used. Also other variables could be introduced in the VAR model. Practical implications: Regardless of the issue of the “grease” vs the “sand the wheels” debate, corruption should be reduced because it is anyway harmful for human development. The differences in the results for Latin American and Nordic countries show that the effects of corruption have to be assessed considering the different institutional and economic conditions of the countries analyzed. Social implications: Governments should seek to reduce corruption because, despite corruption can have mixed effects on economic growth in some contexts, it is anyway harmful for human development. Besides, the finding that in some Latin American countries more activity in the extractive industries is generated by means of corruption confirm the association between corruption and extractivism found by Gudynas (2017) and can explain why there are issues of environmental damage and social conflict linked to natural resources in those countries. Originality/value: The present study contributes to the literature by presenting evidence on the effects of corruption on growth, human development and natural resources sector in Latin American and Nordic countries. It is the first study on economics of corruption which directly compares Latin American and Nordic countries. This is relevant because there are important differences between both regions since Latin American countries tend to suffer from widespread corruption, while the Nordic ones have a high level of transparency. It is also the first in using a Bayesian panel VAR approach in order to evaluate the effects of corruption. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","The complementary log-log link was originally introduced in 1922 to R. A. Fisher, long before the logit and probit links. While the last two links are symmetric, the complementary log-log link is an asymmetrical link without a parameter associated with it. Several asymmetrical links with an extra parameter were proposed in the literature over last few years to deal with imbalanced data in binomial regression (when one of the classes is much smaller than the other); however, these do not necessarily have the cloglog link as a special case, with the exception of the link based on the generalized extreme value distribution. In this paper, we introduce flexible cloglog links for modeling binomial regression models that include an extra parameter associated with the link that explains some unbalancing for binomial outcomes. For all cases, the cloglog is a special case or the reciprocal version loglog link is obtained. A Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo inference approach is developed. Simulations study to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm is conducted and prior sensitivity analysis for the extra parameter shows that a uniform prior is the most convenient for all models. Additionally, two applications in medical data (age at menarche and pulmonary infection) illustrate the advantages of the proposed models. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","Tongue classification is a method for identifying and classifying the vernacular employed in a speech or material.

The use of bounded response variables is also very common when there are data containing percentages, rates, or proportions. In this work, with the generalized Gompertz distribution as the baseline distribution, we derive two new two-parameter distributions with bounded support, and new quantile parametric mixed regression models are proposed based on these distributions, which consider bounded response variables with heavy tails. Estimation of the parameters using the Bayesian approach is considered for both models, relying on the No-U-Turn sampler algorithm. The inferential methods can be implemented and then easily used for data analysis. Simulation studies with different quantiles (q= 0.1 , q= 0.5 and q= 0.9) and sample sizes (n= 100 , n= 200 , n= 500 , n= 2000 , n= 5000) were conducted for 100 replicas of simulated data for each combination of settings, in the (0, 1) and [0, 1), showing the good performance of the recovery of parameters for the proposed inferential methods and models, which were compared to Beta Rectangular and Kumaraswamy regression models. Furthermore, a dataset on extreme poverty is analyzed using the proposed regression models with fixed and mixed effects. The quantile parametric models proposed in this work are an alternative and complementary modeling tool for the analysis of bounded data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Traffic accidents are a problem that affects the State and society, because they cause material damage, injuries and even the death of a person. This has led countries such as China, Switzerland and Australia to carry out studies using Bayesian networks to determine the main causes and, based on them, propose measures to reduce the number of traffic accidents. Following this trend, we, without having any expert knowledge on the subject, decided to analyze the data of traffic accidents on the Pan-American Highway in Lima, Peru. This analysis was done by means of directed graph learning with the Hill Climbing Search, Chow-Liu, K2, BIC and BDEU. In addition, we used a Bayesian estimator to calculate the conditional probability distribution for our dataset. This dataset contains observations from the years 2017 to 2019 and approximately 16 km of this highway. Our results show that it is possible to identify the possible causes of excess accidents in specific areas of the Pan-American Highway in certain shifts i.e., 32% of fatal accidents occur between 12 am and 7 pm in the Rimac district and of these 20% are due to pedestrians on the highway.

Despite the poverty in Peru has declined in the last decades, there is still poor districts in risk to become extremely poor, even in its capital, Lima. In this context, it is relevant to study the incidence of extreme poverty at district levels. In this paper, we propose to estimate the quantiles of the incidence of extreme poverty of districts in Lima by using spatial quantile models based on the Kumaraswamy distribution and spatial random effects for areal data. Furthermore, in order to deal with spatial confounding random effects we used the Spatial Orthogonal Centroid “K”orrection approach. Bayesian inference for these hierarchical models is conveniently performed based on the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. Our modeling is flexible and able to describe the quantiles of incidence of extreme poverty in Lima. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","empty","Emotion recognition is a strategy for social robots used to implement better Human-Robot Interaction and model their social behaviour. Since human emotions can be expressed in different ways (e.g., face, gesture, voice), multimodal approaches are useful to support the recognition process. However, although there exist studies dealing with multimodal emotion recognition for social robots, they still present limitations in the fusion process, dropping their performance if one or more modalities are not present or if modalities have different qualities. This is a common situation in social robotics, due to the high variety of the sensory capacities of robots; hence, more flexible multimodal models are needed. In this context, we propose an adaptive and flexible emotion recognition architecture able to work with multiple sources and modalities of information and manage different levels of data quality and missing data, to lead robots to better understand the mood of people in a given environment and accordingly adapt their behaviour. Each modality is analyzed independently to then aggregate the partial results with a previous proposed fusion method, called EmbraceNet+, which is adapted and integrated to our proposed framework. We also present an extensive review of state-of-the-art studies dealing with fusion methods for multimodal emotion recognition approaches. We evaluate the performance of our proposed architecture by performing different tests in which several modalities are combined to classify emotions using four categories (i.e., happiness, neutral, sadness, and anger). Results reveal that our approach is able to adapt to the quality and presence of modalities. Furthermore, results obtained are validated and compared with other similar proposals, obtaining competitive performance with state-of-the-art models. © 2013 IEEE.","The Heliconiini genera Agraulis and Dryas are widely distributed throughout the Neotropics and into adjacent temperate regions, and although they are currently treated as monotypic, both show significant geographic phenotypic variation. In this work, we employ six genetic markers (4199 bp), two mitochondrial and four nuclear, to perform coalescent species delimitation analyses in Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BPP) and in integrated BPP (iBPP), the latter also includes linear measurements and wings landmarks. We also analyze cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) barcode sequences for each genus using genetic distances, haplotype networks and a character-based approach. Based on the model testing results, complemented with data from previous studies, we performed morphometric analyses to compare fore and hindwing size, aspect ratio and shape among the new species. In addition, we compared the forewing spot pattern of hypothesizes species using the r package patternize and, for Dryas, compared the colour patterns of mature larvae. Model testing of the molecular species delimitation outputs favoured a seven species hypothesis for Agraulis and a four species hypothesis for Dryas. Average distances among COI barcode sequences of these groups were from 1.09 to 5.81% in Agraulis and from 1.09 to 3.44% in Dryas. Within-group distances ranged from 0 to 1.11% and between 0 and 2.43%, respectively. NeighborNet haplotype networks showed that all but one of the species are monophyletic, and the character-based approach found exclusive diagnostic positions for most species, while the rest can be recognized by unique combinations of the 44 informative nucleotide positions analysed. Morphometric analysis supported all species of Agraulis and Dryas based on wing shape, and also in several cases on wing sizes and aspect ratio (hindwing length–forewing length), including A. v. galapagensis, which was absent from the molecular study. The analysis of the forewing spot pattern also revealed differences among most species hypothesis. The colour pattern of the last instar larva is also diagnostic for each Dryas species hypothesis. Locality data for species in both genera show that most of them are allopatric albeit a few have contact zones being parapatric at some locations. Based on the observed genetic differences, which covary with morphology and geographical distribution, we recommend the recognition of eight species of Agraulis: A. incarnata, A. vanillae, A. forbesi new status, A. insularis reinstated status, A. maculosa new status, A. lucina reinstated status, A. galapagensis new status and one undescribed species, and four species of Dryas: D. iulia, D. dominicana revised status, D. lucia revised status and D. alcionea reinstated status. Further work is needed to investigate, which selective forces have led to the current configurations of venation and wing shape, the probable gene flow among species with a focus on Agraulis and gather more data on species ecology.

We tested the machine learning algorithm Maxent to predict deforestation across the Peruvian Amazon. We used official annual 2001-2019 deforestation data to develop a predictive model and to test the model's accuracy using near-real-time forest loss data for 2020. Distance from agricultural land and distance from roads were the predictor variables that contributed most to the final model, indicating that a narrower set of variables contribute nearly 80% of the information necessary for prediction at scale. The permutation importance indicating variable information not present in the other variables was also highest for distance from agricultural land and distance from roads, at 40.5% and 14.3%, respectively. The predictive model registered 73.2% of the 2020 early alerts in a high or very high risk category; less than 1% of forest cover in national protected areas were registered as very high risk, but buffer zones were far more vulnerable, with 15% of forest cover being in this category. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use 19 years of annual data for deforestation risk. The open-source machine learning method could be applied to other forest regions, at scale, to improve strategies for reducing future deforestation. © The Author(s) 2021.","Two Peruvian strains of the genus Brachionus were isolated from impacted coastal wet-lands. With an integrative taxonomic view, we described their taxonomic status, morphological characters, productive parameters, and phylogenetic position. In the case of both strains, the relationship between biometrics and productive parameters obtained with Principal Components Analysis indicated that the lorica length was associated with longevity, progeny, egg production, and reproductive age, while the lorica width and aperture were associated with the maximum number of eggs carried. Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference analysis carried out with mtDNA COI gene and rDNA ITS1 region showed that both strains were clustered in two clades with distinct phylogenetic positioning from what is currently known for Brachionus plicatilis s.l. One of the strains, Z010-VL, is proposed to be a subspecies of L4 (B. paranguensis), and the other strain, Z018-SD, is proposed as a sub species of SM2 (B. koreanus). In addition, 33 and 31 aquaculture production lineages are proposed, delimited by COI and concatenated COI+ITS1 sequences, respectively. Finally, this study provides new tools that enhance the traceability of the origin of each sub-species throughout the world. © 2021 by the authors.

To combat against deforestation and landscape change, the Peru government has created Protected Areas (PAs) to maintain floral diversity, conserve forests and environmental services. Along with tremendous anthropogenic pressures, billions of dollars have been spent every year to promote and save the PAs, yet rigorous quantified evaluation and interpretation of such PAs are lacking. Considering such knowledge gap, we have quantified the forest loss under the PAs and their buffer areas over the last 20 years (2001–2019) have been performed using Google Earth Engine. Furthermore, the potential deforestation risk zones were identified using the Maximum Entropy based predictive modelling. Outcome showed that the forest cover losses within the PAs were 114,463 ha and 782,781 ha within the buffer zones in the last 20 years. Additionally, high deforestation risk zones were mainly found in the central and southwestern parts of the Peruvian Amazon and interestingly close to the navigable riverbanks. We have received high prediction accuracy (AUC 0.964) and further validated with high-resolution PlanetScope imageries. This study will be useful for policy interventions and conservation measures. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","empty","Background: Several conventional genomic Bayesian (or no Bayesian) prediction methods have been proposed including the standard additive genetic effect model for which the variance components are estimated with mixed model equations. In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods have been considered in the context of genomic prediction. The DL methods are nonparametric models providing flexibility to adapt to complicated associations between data and output with the ability to adapt to very complex patterns. Main body: We review the applications of deep learning (DL) methods in genomic selection (GS) to obtain a meta-picture of GS performance and highlight how these tools can help solve challenging plant breeding problems. We also provide general guidance for the effective use of DL methods including the fundamentals of DL and the requirements for its appropriate use. We discuss the pros and cons of this technique compared to traditional genomic prediction approaches as well as the current trends in DL applications. Conclusions: The main requirement for using DL is the quality and sufficiently large training data. Although, based on current literature GS in plant and animal breeding we did not find clear superiority of DL in terms of prediction power compared to conventional genome based prediction models. Nevertheless, there are clear evidences that DL algorithms capture nonlinear patterns more efficiently than conventional genome based. Deep learning algorithms are able to integrate data from different sources as is usually needed in GS assisted breeding and it shows the ability for improving prediction accuracy for large plant breeding data. It is important to apply DL to large training-testing data sets. © 2021, The Author(s).","In this paper, we developed a full set of Bayesian inference tools, for zero-and/or-one augmented beta rectangular regression models to analyze limited-augmented data, under a new parameterization. This parameterization: facilitates the development of both regression models and inferential tools as well as make simplifies the respective computational implementations. The proposed Bayesian tools were parameter estimation, model fit assessment, model comparison (information criteria), residual analysis and case influence diagnostics, developed through MCMC algorithms. In addition, we adapted available methods of posterior predictive checking, using appropriate discrepancy measures. We conducted several simulation studies, considering some situations of practical interest, aiming to evaluate: prior sensitivity choice, parameter recovery of the proposed model and estimation method, the impact of transforming the observed zeros and ones, along with the use of non-augmented models, and the behavior of the proposed model fit assessment and model comparison tools. A psychometric real data set was analyzed to illustrate the performance of the developed tools, illustrating the advantages of the developed analysis framework. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2021.","Genomic selection (GS) is revolutionizing conventional ways of developing new plants and animals. However, because it is a predictive methodology, GS strongly depends on statistical and machine learning to perform these predictions. For continuous outcomes, more models are available for GS. Unfortunately, for count data outcomes, there are few efficient statistical machine learning models for large datasets or for datasets with fewer observations than independent variables. For this reason, in this paper, we applied the univariate version of the Poisson deep neural network (PDNN) proposed earlier for genomic predictions of count data. The model was implemented with (a) the negative log-likelihood of Poisson distribution as the loss function, (b) the rectified linear activation unit as the activation function in hidden layers, and (c) the exponential activation function in the output layer. The advantage of the PDNN model is that it captures complex patterns in the data by implementing many nonlinear transformations in the hidden layers. Moreover, since it was implemented in Tensorflow as the back-end, and in Keras as the front-end, the model can be applied to moderate and large datasets, which is a significant advantage over previous GS models for count data. The PDNN model was compared with deep learning models with continuous outcomes, conventional generalized Poisson regression models, and conventional Bayesian regression methods. We found that the PDNN model outperformed the Bayesian regression and generalized Poisson regression methods in terms of prediction accuracy, although it was not better than the conventional deep neural network with continuous outcomes. © 2021 The Authors.

In adults, one of the most widely used indicators of skeletal age is the Root Dentin Translucency (RDT), mainly through the Lamendin technique, which is used in various Latin American contexts. Recently, Parra et al. (2020) have developed a Bayesian regression model using the Lamendin technique to establish standardized criteria for estimating age-at-death in adults in various forensic contexts. In this study, we evaluate the applicability of this proposal together with the proposal by Lamendin et al. (1992) and Prince and Ubelaker (2002) in Latin American contexts. A sample of single-rooted teeth belonging to 805 individuals from six Latin American countries was used. The results of the three proposals considered were analyzed taking into account factors such as age, sex, origin, and the tooth surface on which the variables were surveyed. Of the factors that would affect the estimates, it was found that the age of the individuals had the greatest influence. However, it was confirmed that the sex and surface of the teeth on which the measurements were taken did not influence the final result. On the other hand, as we expected, the application of the analyzed proposals would also be possible in other forensic contexts, as shown by the results obtained according to the origin. This research expands the FIDB with more information on Latino contexts. © 2021 American Academy of Forensic Sciences","empty","The Penaeidae family includes some of the most economic and ecological important marine shrimp, comprising hundreds of species. Despite this importance and diversity, the taxonomic classification for penaeid shrimp has constantly been revised, and issues related to the species identification are common. In this study, we implemented DNA barcoding analyses in addition to single-gene species delimitation analyses in order to identify molecular operational taxonomy units (MOTUs) and to generate robust molecular information for penaeid shrimp based on the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) mitochondrial gene. Our final data set includes COI sequences from 112 taxa distributed in 23 genera of penaeids. We employed the general mixed Yule coalescent (GMYC) model, the Poisson tree processes (PTP), and the Bayesian PTP model (bPTP) for MOTUs delimitation. Intraspecific and interspecific genetic distances were also calculated. Our findings evidenced a high level of hidden diversity, showing 143 MOTUs, with 27 nominal species not agreeing with the genetic delimitation obtained here. These data represent potential new species or highly structured populations, showing the importance of including a non-distance-based species delimitation approach in biodiversity studies. The results raised by this study shed light on the Penaeidae biodiversity, addressing important issues about taxonomy and mislabeling in databases and contributing to a better comprehension of the group, which can certainly help management policies for shrimp fishery activity in addition to conservation programs. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we explored the species-level taxonomy, phylogenetic relationships, and geographic distributions of the tritoniid nudibranchs. During numerous expeditions, specimens from southern South America, Sub-Antarctic Islands, and Antarctica were collected, documented alive, and fixed for anatomical descriptions and genetic sequencing. DNA from 167 specimens were extracted and sequenced for mitochondrial (COI, 16S) and nuclear (H3) markers. An additional 109 sequences of all available tritoniids plus additional outgroups were downloaded from GenBank for comparative purposes. Maximum Likelihood under the GHOST model of evolution and Bayesian inference using the GTR + GAMMA model produced congruent topologies from concatenated alignments. The results of ABGD, GMYC, bPTP, and mPTP species delimitation analyses suggest many separately evolving units that do not coincide with traditionally recognized species limits. Southern Ocean Tritoniella and Tritonia species split into several previously unrecognized species. This result is in accordance with the limited dispersal abilities of some southern tritoniids. Along with the most complete phylogeny of Tritoniidae to date, we also provided many taxonomic notes at the species and genus level. Tritoniidae species are yet another example of under-recognized diversity in the Southern Ocean. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","High sulfur emissions in the Central Andes have in the past been attributed to active volcanoes and numerous copper smelting facilities in the region. This study evaluates the contribution of these sources on Arequipa, Peru through an evaluation of aerosol sulfate δ34S values and water-soluble ions (WSI). The anthropogenic and natural sources of particulate pollution were determined by aerosol filter sampling from four different locations (urban, suburban, industrial, and rural) providing a view of the spatial variability of aerosols within the city. Sulfate (avg. 2.97 μm/m3) is the most abundant ion species in the aerosols sampled contributing on average 20% of the molar mass. Ion composition profiles between sampling sites are very similar indicating common sources and high contributions of mobilized local surface salt to the aerosols in this desert region. The regional atmospheric chemistry model (RACM) 0-D run for the area confirms that emissions from fuel combustion sources alone cannot account for the high concentrations of sulfate observed. A combination of the RACM results, WSI data, and a Bayesian δ34S isotope mixing model determined that the majority of aerosol sulfates in the area are from mineral dust adding to fossil fuel combustion sources. Mineral dust entrainment in the region is likely elevated by the close proximity of open-pit mining and unpaved roads near the city. Marine organic aerosols and smelting located along the Pacific contribute little to Arequipa's aerosol sulfate concentration. While the influence of volcanic sulfate (9% on average) is low, overall natural sulfate (dust, volcanic, and DMS) accounts for 43% of the aerosol sulfate. Therefore, even though the local environment creates high sulfate background levels, a reduction of sulfate aerosol pollution would be possible if fossil fuel emissions were reduced. © 2021 The Author(s)","Regional earthquake early warning (EEW) alerts and related risk-mitigation actions are often triggered when the expected value of a ground-motion intensity measure (IM), computed from real-time magnitude and source location estimates, exceeds a predefined critical IM threshold. However, the shaking experienced in mid- to high-rise buildings may be significantly different from that on the ground, which could lead to sub-optimal decision-making (i.e., increased occurrences of false and missed EEW alarms) with the aforementioned strategy. This study facilitates an important advancement in EEW decision-support, by developing empirical models that directly relate earthquake source parameters to resulting approximate responses in multistory buildings. The proposed models can leverage real-time earthquake information provided by a regional EEW system, to provide rapid predictions of structure-specific engineering demand parameters that can be used to more accurately determine whether or not an alert is triggered. We use a simplified continuum building model consisting of a flexural/shear beam combination and vary its parameters to capture a wide range of deformation modes in different building types. We analyse the approximate responses for the building model variations, using Italian accelerometric data and corresponding source parameter information from 54 earthquakes. The resulting empirical prediction equations are incorporated in a real-time Bayesian framework that can be used for building-specific EEW applications, such as (1) early warning of floor-shaking sensed by occupants; and (2) elevator control. Finally, we demonstrate the improvement in EEW alert accuracy that can be achieved using the proposed models. © 2021, The Author(s).","The catfish family Heptapteridae is ubiquitous across a range of freshwater habitats from southern Mexico to northern Argentina and contains 23 genera and 228 valid species. After a century of mostly morphology-based systematic analyses of these fishes, we provide the first molecular phylogenetic hypothesis spanning most valid Heptapteridae genera (16 of 23). We examined eight of 14 valid genera in the Nemuroglanis-subclade (Heptapterini), all valid genera in the Brachyglanis-subclade (Brachyglaniini) and most valid Brachyglaniini species (11 of 15). Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of a 4156-base alignment of five gene regions (three mitochondrial: COI, Cyt b, and ND2; two nuclear: RAG2, Glyt) yielded thoroughly resolved and statistically robust phylogenies that were largely congruent with each other and with previous morphology-based hypotheses. We propose a revised phylogenetic classification consisting of two subfamilies (Rhamdiinae, Heptapterinae) each with two tribes. Dense taxonomic sampling of Brachyglaniini, including type species of Brachyglanis, Gladioglanis, Leptorhamdia, and Myoglanis, revealed widespread paraphyly. Newly recovered clades within Brachyglaniini are closely associated with either the upper Orinoco or the Essequibo suggesting repeated dispersals and/or range expansions/contractions across the western Guiana Shield highlands and from there to the upper Amazon and Brazilian Shield. These biogeographical processes appear to have been an important driver of allopatric diversification in the clade. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Both genetic drift and divergent selection are predicted to be drivers of population differentiation across patchy habitats, but the extent to which these forces act on natural populations to shape traits is strongly affected by species’ ecological features. In this study, we infer the genomic structure of Pitcairnia lanuginosa, a widespread herbaceous perennial plant with a patchy distribution. We sampled populations in the Brazilian Cerrado and the Central Andean Yungas and discovered and genotyped SNP markers using double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing. In addition, we analyzed ecophysiological traits obtained from a common garden experiment and compared patterns of phenotypic and genetic divergence (PST–FST comparisons) in a subset of populations from the Cerrado. Our results from molecular analyses pointed to extremely low genetic diversity and a remarkable population differentiation, supporting a major role of genetic drift. Approximately 0.3% of genotyped SNPs were flagged as differentiation outliers by at least two distinct methods, and Bayesian generalized linear mixed models revealed a signature of isolation by environment in addition to isolation by distance for high-differentiation outlier SNPs among the Cerrado populations. PST–FST comparisons suggested divergent selection on two ecophysiological traits linked to drought tolerance. We showed that these traits vary among populations, although without any particular macro-spatial pattern, suggesting local adaptation to differences in micro-habitats. Our study shows that selection might be a relevant force, particularly for traits involved in drought stress, even for populations experiencing strong drift, which improves our knowledge on eco-evolutionary processes acting on non-continuously distributed species. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Genetics Society.","Conservation corridors are an interesting strategy considering the increasing forest conversion by agricultural areas. We used Bayesian multispecies occupancy model in order to assess the occupancy of mammal species along the Manu-Tambopata conservation corridor (4 164.06 km2), located in the southern Peruvian Amazon.We installed 102 camera traps between May and October of 2017 (8 104 camera days), in four management regimes: Río Los Amigos conservation concession, forestry concessions (ACOMAT), Tambopata National Reserve and agricultural lands. Twenty-seven species of terrestrial mammals were recorded; however, models did not reveal significant differences in species richness among management regimes, although an effect of edge density on community-level occupancy was evident. Non-significant relationships were found between commonly hunted species and management regimes, apart from the white-lipped peccary; however, short-eared dog (Atelocynus microtis) and jaguar (Panthera onca) occupancy were significantly lower on agricultural lands. Our results suggested that, in general, the management regimes and covariables (edge density and distance to roads) did not have an effect at the community level but did have species-specific effects for some species (e.g., A. microtis). MAT corridor is still a space where it is feasible to maintain healthy populations of mammals, although its long-term viability requires ensuring connectivity at both a functional and structural levels. © SAREM, 2021.","empty","empty","empty","empty","From a forensic perspective, age-at-death estimation in adults is a constant concern that impacts the development of investigations regarding unidentified dead bodies and the need to identify them. Several procedures for age-at-death estimation in adults have been introduced in Peru, and are used in various fields such as bioarcheology and forensics, but very little is known about the precision and accuracy levels of these procedures. Methods derived from the Lamendin technique, validated and the levels of applicability and confidence of the method, have been widely used in Peru since the year 2000 are known. However, a new estimation system using the Lamendin technique has been developed through a Bayesian model. This model stores the information measured in a Forensic International Dental Database (FIDB), which contains information of several populations and also contributes to assessing the applicability levels of this procedure, resulting in more information that can contribute to strengthen the calculation and the outcome. Results show that the Bayesian model has a homogeneous behavior when it is applied to a Peruvian population, and it shows a better adjustment than previous procedures designed for Peruvian populations. Our research recommends using the Bayesian model for forensic age estimation in this population. Lamendin's technique and its methodological derivatives may contribute to start thinking about the global standardization of the method based on forensic Quality Management criteria, which include –but are not limited to– interlaboratory measurement controls, calibration of measurement sources, and application procedure guides. © 2021 The Authors","The increasing demand for tropical timber from natural forests has reduced the population sizes of native species such as Cedrela spp. because of their high economic value. To prevent the decline of population sizes of the species, all Cedrela species have been incorporated into Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The study presents information about the modeled distribution of the genus Cedrela in Peru that aims to identify potential habitat distribution of the genus, its availability in areas protected by national service of protected areas, and highlighted some areas because of their conservation relevance and the potential need for restoration. We modeled the distribution of the genus Cedrela in Peru using 947 occurrence records that included 10 species (C. odorata, C. montana, C. fissilis, C. longipetiolulata, C. angustifolia, C. nebulosa, C. kuelapensis, C. saltensis, C. weberbaueri, and C. molinensis). We aim to identify areas environmentally suitable for the occurrence of Cedrela that are legally protected by the National Service of Protected Areas (PAs) and those that are ideal for research and restoration projects. We used various environmental variables (19 bioclimatic variables, 3 topographic factors, 9 edaphic factors, solar radiation, and relative humidity) and the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) to predict the probability of occurrence. We observed that 6.7% (86,916.2 km2) of Peru presents a high distribution probability of occurrence of Cedrela, distributed in 17 departments, with 4.4% (10,171.03 km2) of the area protected by PAs mainly under the category of protection forests. Another 11.65% (21,345.16 km2) of distribution covers areas highly prone to degradation, distributed mainly in the departments Ucayali, Loreto, and Madre de Dios, and needs immediate attention for its protection and restoration. We believe that the study will contribute significantly to conserve Cedrela and other endangered species, as well as to promote the sustainable use and management of timber species as a whole. © 2021 by the authors.

While this information is crucial for informing management, information is lacking for many ecologically important species, including apex predators. In this study we examine patterns of genetic structure in the broadnose sevengill shark, Notorynchus cepedianus across its global distribution. We estimate patterns of connectivity among broadnose sevengill shark populations from three major oceanic regions (South Atlantic, Oceania and Eastern Pacific) by contrasting mitochondrial and nuclear DNA haplotype frequencies. We also produced time calibrated Bayesian Inference phylogenetic reconstructions to analyses global phylogeographic patterns and estimate divergence times among distinctive shark lineages. Our results demonstrate significant genetic differentiation among oceanic regions (ΦST = 0.9789, P < 0.0001) and a lack of genetic structuring within regions (ΦST = − 0.007; P = 0.479). Time calibrated Bayesian Inference phylogenetic reconstructions indicate that the observed patterns of genetic structure among oceanic regions are historical, with regional populations estimated to have diverged from a common ancestor during the early to mid-Pleistocene. Our results indicate significant genetic structuring and a lack of gene flow among broadnose sevengill shark populations from the South Atlantic, Oceania and Eastern Pacific regions. Evidence of deep lineage divergences coinciding with the early to mid-Pleistocene suggests historical glacial cycling has contributed to the vicariant divergence of broadnose sevengill shark populations from different ocean basins. These finding will help inform global management of broadnose sevengill shark populations, and provides new insights into historical and contemporary evolutionary processes shaping populations of this ecologically important apex predator. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","As currently understood, the genus Octodon contains five species degus, lunatus, bridgesii, pacificus, and ricardojeda. Previous phylogenetic studies suggest that genus specific diversity is underestimated. In order to evaluate the taxonomic diversity of Octodon, we implemented unilocus (cytochrome-b) and multilocus (cytochrome-b + 4 nuclear genes) species delimitation methods. Octodon degus was recovered as a sister of the other species of the genus. The unilocus bGMYC and mPTP methods, based on cytochrome-b sequences, delimits 11 and 7 candidate species respectively, and both methods fail to recognize O. pacificus from O. ricardojeda. Results of the multilocus analysis (BPP) vary as a function of the dataset used. When the five genes are used 11 species are delimited, while eight species are delimited when only the nuclear genes are used. Octodon bridgesii is shown as comprising at least two species (one on the Pacific coast and the typical form found on the Andean slopes), while O. ricardojeda may comprise two species (one on the Chilean side of the Andes and the other in Argentina). Likewise, both multilocus matrices recover O. pacificus as a distinct species. This shows that species diversity of Octodon is underestimated. Remarkably, many of the delimited species based on genetic data are morphologically differentiated in cranio-dental characteristics. However, a pair of species has not achieved morphological differentiation, being cryptic species. Finally, the incongruence between mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies suggests that processes such as incomplete lineage sorting and/or introgression have been present during the radiation of the genus. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","empty","empty","Angel sharks are distributed worldwide in tropical to subtropical waters. Across the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO), two valid species are reported: The Pacific angelshark Squatina californica and the Chilean angelshark Squatina armata; however, there is still uncertainty about their geographic distribution, mainly along the northern Peru coast where the species have been reported to be sympatric. The aim of this study is to describe the genetic differences between the genus Squatina from the EPO, including samples from northern Peru, and using DNA barcoding and three species delimitation models: Poisson tree processes (PTP) model, Bayesian implementation of the PTP (bPTP) model and the general mixed Yule coalescent (GMYC) model. The three approaches summarized 19 nominal Squatina species in 23 consensus Molecular Taxonomic Units (MOTU). Only 16 of them were in accordance with taxonomic identifications. From the EPO, four Squatina MOTUs were identified, one from North America (S. californica USA/Mexico) and three sampled in northern Peru, S. californica Peru, S. armata and Squatina sp. (a potential new species). This study contributes to the management and conservation policies of angel sharks in Peru, suggesting the presence of an undescribed species inhabiting the northern Peruvian coast. The use of molecular approaches, such as DNA barcoding, has the potential to quickly flag undescribed species in poorly studied regions, including the Southeast Pacific, within groups of ecologically and economically important groups like angel sharks. © 2021 by the authors.

Materials and Methods: We extracted DNA from museum specimen osteocrusts and from fecal samples collected from free-ranging individuals. We sequenced the mtDNA cytochrome b gene and the control region from samples collected at 13 different sites and used Bayesian inference and Maximum Likelihood to identify distinct clades. We took measurements of the crania of a subset of these specimens (n = 26) and ran a logistic regression to determine if any of the cranial measurements (n = 22) could predict a specimen's clade. In addition, we examined the pelage patterns of the museum specimens and photographs taken of free-ranging individuals and divided them into pelage types based on coloration of the underbelly. Results: We identified two divergent clades, and two distinct groups with clear geographic boundaries within one of those clades. Two measurements of the zygomatic bone perfectly predicted a given individual's mtDNA clade. We found four distinct pelage patterns in our samples, but these patterns are variable within clades and among individuals within the same population. Conclusion: These analyses indicate that the two recognized subspecies of pygmy marmoset should be elevated to the species level (C. pygmaea and C. niveiventris) based on molecular and cranial differences but not on pelage patterns. We provide evidence on the geographic limits of the two clades and identify regions where additional sampling is required to better define the geographic distribution of the two clades. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","The Stochastic Volatility in Mean (SVM) model of Koopman and Uspensky (2002) is revisited. An empirical study of five Latin American indexes in order to see the impact of the volatility in the mean of the returns is performed. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Hamiltonian dynamics is used to estimate latent volatilities and parameters. Our findings show that volatility has a negative impact on returns, indicating that volatility feedback effect is stronger than the effect related to the expected volatility.

Using 14C dating on stem pieces sequestered within the plant's cushion, which grows larger through time, we obtain ages of 15 ± 15 14C yrs BP and 165 ± 15 14C yrs BP at depths of 15 cm and 29 cm below the cushion's living surface, respectively. Applying a mixed calibration curve with a Bayesian growth model yields calendar age ranges of 1948–1958 CE and 1802–1935 CE for our 14C dates, respectively. Such ages provide sufficiently precise constraints for investigations requiring dating during the last few hundred years when individual 14C dates yield imprecise calendar age ranges. We infer a long-term growth rate of 1.3–3.5 mm yr−1, corroborating published maximum short-term growth rates. Extrapolating our growth model to the A. compacta's core suggests that it began growing as early as 1462–1830 CE. At such age it lived through myriad important geological and historical events, including regional earthquakes, volcanic unrest at Misti, decades to centuries of the Little Ice Age, and a broad transect of Peruvian history possibly beginning during the Inca Empire. A. compacta may provide another important geochronological resource in the arid Central Andes that can be applied to date volcanological, glacial, mass-movement, and archaeological features, especially where dendrochronology and lichenometry are not possible. © 2021","The understanding of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, is essential to improve evidence-based public health policies. The effective reproductive number (Rt) in Peru was estimated using information from 113 complete genomes sequenced by the Instituto Nacional de Salud del Perú (INS), available in the GISAID public database. The Rt trend during March and April of 2020 was found to be similar to results from other epidemiological reports. The Rt decreased during the first two weeks of March. Its lowest value was reported during the week after the quarantine began. The Rt increased moderately after the second week of April. The implication of early decisions taken to mitigate the transmission are discussed.

However, the effect of severe drought and extremely wet conditions on the timing and intensity of dengue epidemics is poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to quantify the non-linear and delayed effects of extreme hydrometeorological hazards on dengue risk by level of urbanisation in Brazil using a spatiotemporal model. Methods: We combined distributed lag non-linear models with a spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical model framework to determine the exposure-lag-response association between the relative risk (RR) of dengue and a drought severity index. We fit the model to monthly dengue case data for the 558 microregions of Brazil between January, 2001, and January, 2019, accounting for unobserved confounding factors, spatial autocorrelation, seasonality, and interannual variability. We assessed the variation in RR by level of urbanisation through an interaction between the drought severity index and urbanisation. We also assessed the effect of hydrometeorological hazards on dengue risk in areas with a high frequency of water supply shortages. Findings: The dataset included 12 895 293 dengue cases reported between 2001 and 2019 in Brazil. Overall, the risk of dengue increased between 0–3 months after extremely wet conditions (maximum RR at 1 month lag 1·56 [95% CI 1·41–1·73]) and 3–5 months after drought conditions (maximum RR at 4 months lag 1·43 [1·22–1·67]). Including a linear interaction between the drought severity index and level of urbanisation improved the model fit and showed the risk of dengue was higher in more rural areas than highly urbanised areas during extremely wet conditions (maximum RR 1·77 [1·32–2·37] at 0 months lag vs maximum RR 1·58 [1·39–1·81] at 2 months lag), but higher in highly urbanised areas than rural areas after extreme drought (maximum RR 1·60 [1·33–1·92] vs 1·15 [1·08–1·22], both at 4 months lag). We also found the dengue risk following extreme drought was higher in areas that had a higher frequency of water supply shortages. Interpretation: Wet conditions and extreme drought can increase the risk of dengue with different delays. The risk associated with extremely wet conditions was higher in more rural areas and the risk associated with extreme drought was exacerbated in highly urbanised areas, which have water shortages and intermittent water supply during droughts. These findings have implications for targeting mosquito control activities in poorly serviced urban areas, not only during the wet and warm season, but also during drought periods.

Refrigeration systems are widely used in the food industry and are essentially important for the Perú's agro-export sector, the main products in this sector are mango, banana, and grape. Advanced control strategies offer the potential to increase the energy efficiency of refrigeration processes while ensuring the quality required for agro-export products.

In particular, several taxonomic changes in butterflies (Papilionoidea) have been made solely on the basis of molecular data without identifying morphological synapomorphies that might have aided in diagnosing taxa from butterfly collections or specimens with no accessible DNA. We here focus on the butterfly genus Pseudodebis Forster, 1964 in the so-called 'Taygetis clade', which is one of the major clades in the diverse Neotropical nymphalid subtribe Euptychiina. We inferred the evolution of a male genitalic character using the most comprehensive molecular phylogeny for the 'Taygetis clade' to date. This approach allowed us to identify a synapomorphy for Pseudodebis Forster, 1964, which can be used to morphologically diagnose this genus and to distinguish it from other genera in the 'Taygetis clade'. In addition, we describe two new species of Pseudodebis, P. nakamurai Nakahara & Willmott, sp. nov. and P. pieti Nakahara & Willmott, sp. nov., recovered as sister species based on molecular data, with an estimated time of divergence of 0.3 Ma (Bayesian confidence interval 0.03-1.61 Ma). Despite the low genetic divergence between these two Pseudodebis species, they can be readily distinguished by wing morphology. Pseudodebis nakamurai, sp. nov. and P. pieti, sp. nov. occur in partial sympatry across an elevational gradient along the western Andes, and the inferred recent speciation event might be related to a shift in elevation and possibly a change in larval hostplant preference. urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:38B4AF76-79E9-4D4D-BF16-FCD8F53A7277. © 2021 CSIRO.","Malaria remains a major public health problem in many countries. Unlike influenza and HIV, where diversity in immunodominant surface antigens is understood geographically to inform disease surveillance, relatively little is known about the global population structure of PfEMP1, the major variant surface antigen of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The complexity of the var multigene family that encodes PfEMP1 and that diversifies by recombination, has so far precluded its use in malaria surveillance. Recent studies have demonstrated that cost-effective deep sequencing of the region of var genes encoding the PfEMP1 DBLα domain and subsequent classification of within host sequences at 96% identity to define unique DBLα types, can reveal structure and strain dynamics within countries. However, to date there has not been a comprehensive comparison of these DBLα types between countries. By leveraging a bioinformatic approach (jumping hidden Markov model) designed specifically for the analysis of recombination within var genes and applying it to a dataset of DBLα types from 10 countries, we are able to describe population structure of DBLα types at the global scale. The sensitivity of the approach allows for the comparison of the global dataset to ape samples of Plasmodium Laverania species. Our analyses show that the evolution of the parasite population emerging out of Africa underlies current patterns of DBLα type diversity. Most importantly, we can distinguish geographic population structure within Africa between Gabon and Ghana in West Africa and Uganda in East Africa. Our evolutionary findings have translational implications in the context of globalization. Firstly, DBLα type diversity can provide a simple diagnostic framework for geographic surveillance of the rapidly evolving transmission dynamics of P. falciparum. It can also inform efforts to understand the presence or absence of global, regional and local population immunity to major surface antigen variants. Additionally, we identify a number of highly conserved DBLα types that are present globally that may be of biological significance and warrant further characterization. © 2021 Tonkin-Hill et al.

These can be achieved through the use of analytical tools, which depend on the collection of large amounts of data, in this particular case in the form of time series. During the last few years, various conventional and neural network-based methods have shown great promise in problems related to estimating milling cutter wear. Among neural networks, recurrent networks are especially promising due to the memory mechanism they use. In the present work, a comparison is made between a CNN network and a CNN-LSTM network. Both networks extract information directly from the time series of a widely used database. Unlike similar works in the existing literature, two simple preprocessing techniques are used: to remove the tendency of the time series and to equalize the initial values of the tool wear. Additionally, Bayesian optimization of hyperparameters is used. Mean square errors are obtained that are consistently around 10, results equivalent to the state of the art. © 2021 IEEE.","The study was about the pioneer plant species which arise from the glacial retreat of the Pastoruri snow-capped as a result of the thaw that fluctuates between 10 and 12 meters per year. The studied area was the periglacial zone of the snow-capped, the retreat of this glacier is adduced to the climatic variability in the last years. Two families of plants - the Asteraceae and the Poaceae-were found in the area. In the first family, the existing species are: Senecio sublutescens Cuatrec., Baccharis tricuneata (L.f) Pers., Novenia acaulis Cuatrec., Xenophyllum dactylophyllum, V.A. Funk digitatum Funk., Senecio adenophyllus, and in the second family the species identified was the Calamagrostis ef. In order to evaluate the retreat of the Pastoruri glacier, the ice-covered area in the year 2001 was taken as the base point, and it was evaluated up to April 15, 2017, in which it was noticed that the retreat reached 20.95 %, this calculation was made using historical data from the National Service of Meteorology and Hydrology of Peru (SENAMHI), and the use of MAXENT software and Geographic Information System (GIS). It is concluded that the glaciers in the Cordillera Blanca are important indicators of the climate change; and that after these changes it is begun an altitudinal migration of the autochthonous plant species of the Andes taking up the spaces left by the retreat, and that sometimes these species do not adapt to the changes and disappear.

An example is the behavior of the proportion of voters favorable to a political party in municipalities (or cities) of a country over time. This behavior can be different depending on the region of the country, giving rise to groups (or clusters) with similar profiles. For this kind of data, we propose a finite mixture of a random effects regression model based on the L-Logistic distribution. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is tailored to obtain posterior distributions of the unknown quantities of interest through a Bayesian approach. To illustrate the proposed method, with emphasis on analysis of clusters, we analyze the proportion of votes for a political party in presidential elections in different municipalities observed over time, and then identify groups according to electoral behavior at different levels of favorable votes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","We aimed to verify the relationship between body measurements (BM) and body weight as well as to investigate the prediction of live weight (LW) by using original BM and principal component scores of Corriedale ewes. BM of 100 ewes collected in the Illpa Experimental Centre of the National University of Altiplano in Peru were used. Data were recorded on LW, wither height (WH), rump height (RH), thoracic perimeter (TP), abdominal perimeter (AP), fore-shank length (FSL), fore-shank width (FSW), fore-shank perimeter (FSP), tail width (TW), tail perimeter (TPe), hip width (HW), loin width (LWi), shoulder width (SW), forelimb length (FL) and body length (BL). Pear-son correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to LW and others BM. Additionally, regression equations of LW on BM and on its principal components (PC) were computed. Models were compared by using coefficients of multiple determinations (R2), Akaike information (AIC), Bayesian information (BIC) criteria and root mean squared error (RMSE). Correlations (r) for all BM with LW were positive and significant (r = 0.20-0.78), except for FSW (r = 0.18). The PCA of BM and LW extracted four components explaining 68.7% of the total variance. The prediction LW model by using four PC had the lowest RMSE, AIC and BIC values as well as the highest R2 compared to models with smaller number of PC or based on original measurements. Our results suggested that this approach is a feasible alternative to predict LW. © 2021 Canaza-Cayo et al.","The current spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had put all the scientific community in alert.

In order to account for uncertainty, the TCN estimated the 5%, 50% and 95% prediction quantiles. Evaluation was made using the MAE, MAD, MSLE, RMSLE and PICP metrics. Results suggested some variations in the data distribution. Test results shown an improvement of 24.241, 0.704 and 0.422 for the MAD, MSLE and RMSLE metrics respectively.

The structural simplicity and lack of distinctive phenotypic variation in this group enable the use of DNA-based species delimitation methods in combination with phylogenies (and morphology when feasible) to establish well-supported boundaries among species. Our study employed a multilocus phylogeny and four DNA-based methods (automated barcode gap discovery [ABGD], statistical parsimony [SPN], generalized mixed Yule coalescent [GMYC], and Bayesian phylogenetics and phylogeography [BPP]) for four molecular markers (acl1, act, rpb2, and tef1) to delimit species of two lineages of Trichoderma. Although incongruence among these methods was observed in our analyses, the genetic distance (ABGD) and coalescence (BPP) methods and the multilocus phylogeny strongly supported and confirmed recognition of 108 and 39 different species in the Harzianum and Longibrachiatum lineages, including three new species associated with cacao farms in northern Peru, namely, T.awajun, sp. nov., T.jaklitschii, sp. nov., and T.peruvianum, sp. nov. Morphological distinctions between the new species and their close relatives are primarily related to growth rates, colony appearance, and size of phialides and conidia.

Therefore, the genetic diversity and population structure of a Peruvian germplasm collection of plant coffee was analyzed to ascertain its potential use in plant breeding and conservation. In this work 54 DNA genotypes from 17 Coffea arabica L. and one C. canephora Pierre ex A. Froehner accessions were analyzed by microsatellite and sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers. In the assessment of molecular markers both systems were adequate to perform C. arabica germplasm collection genetic analysis. The obtained genetic diversity estimators were similar to germplasm assessments from other plant breeding programs. In the population structure analysis, the genetic differentiation (GST = 0.6584) and genetic flow (Nm = 0.2594) estimators were high. In analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), total variation was divided 43.05% between accessions and 56.95% within accessions. In the Bayesian analysis with STRUCTURE software using admixed model for K = 2, the C. arabica and C. canephora accessions were separated, while for K = 7, the C. arabica accessions were grouped similarly to what obtained by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) dendrogram. The high genetic differentiation and genetic structuring of the accessions would indicate that the cultivars, from which the accessions were originated, have been preserved over time. The genetic diversity of Peruvian coffee might be the consequence of a long history of introductions of cultivars from different origins. © 2021, Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias, INIA.

P300 classification pipelines based on Riemannian Geometry provide accuracies on par with state-of-the-art pipelines, without having the need for spatial filters, and also possess the ability to be calibrated with little data. In this study, five different P300 detection pipelines are compared, with three of them using Riemannian Geometry as either feature extraction or classification algorithms. The goal of this study is to assess the viability of Riemannian Geometry-based methods in non-optimal environments with sudden background noise changes, rather than maximizing classification accuracy values. For fifteen subjects, the average single-trial accuracy obtained for each pipeline was: 56.06% for Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), 72.13% for Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis (BLDA), 63.56% for Riemannian Minimum Distance to Mean (MDM), 69.22% for Riemannian Tangent Space with Logistic Regression (TS-LogR), and 63.30% for Riemannian Tangent Space with Support Vector Machine (TS-SVM). The results are higher for the pipelines based on BLDA and TS-LogR, suggesting that they could be viable methods for the detection of the P300 component when maximizing the bit rate is needed. For multiple-trial classification, the BLDA pipeline converged faster towards higher average values, closely followed by the TS-LogR pipeline. The two remaining Riemannian methods' accuracy also increases with the number of trials, but towards a lower value compared to the aforementioned ones. Single-stimulus detection metrics revealed that the TS-LogR pipeline can be a viable classification method, as its results are only slightly lower than those obtained with BLDA. P300 waveforms were also analyzed to check for evidence of the component being elicited. Finally, a questionnaire was used to retrieve the most intuitive focusing methods employed by the subjects. © 2001-2011 IEEE.","Estimation of the age-at-death in adults is essential when the identification of deceased persons with unknown identity is required in both humanitarian and judicial contexts. However, the methodologies and the results obtained can be questioned. Various efforts have been developed to adjust procedures to specific populations, always seeking the precision and accuracy of the methodologies. It is known that the estimation of the age-at-death in adults coexists with wide margins of error, due to several reasons, including but not limited to statistical problems, the size of the sample or the physiological process of aging. This research focuses on a degenerative indicator of the dentin (Root Dentin Translucency) and its combination with Periodontal Height (PH) following the Lamendin's technique for estimation of the age-at-death in adults. The main objective of this research was to demonstrate the applicability of a Bayesian model based on a Forensic International Dental Database (FIDB) that include Root Translucency Height (RTH) and PH as a method to age-at-death in adults. The conclusion of this research was that the combined both indicators become a generalizable age-at-death in adults model for all human populations, where the Bayesian method would offer optimal results in any population. In this way, those populations that do not have had the possibility of validating a specific procedure, now have the opportunity to apply a valid method for estimating age-at-death in adults to global scope. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Globally, our knowledge on lake fisheries is still limited despite their importance to food security and livelihoods. Here we show that fish catches can respond either positively or negatively to climate and land-use changes, by analyzing time-series data (1970–2014) for 31 lakes across five continents. We find that effects of a climate or land-use driver (e.g., air temperature) on lake environment could be relatively consistent in directions, but consequential changes in a lake-environmental factor (e.g., water temperature) could result in either increases or decreases in fish catch in a given lake. A subsequent correlation analysis indicates that reductions in fish catch was less likely to occur in response to potential climate and land-use changes if a lake is located in a region with greater access to clean water. This finding suggests that adequate investments for water-quality protection and water-use efficiency can provide additional benefits to lake fisheries and food security. © 2020, The Author(s).","Conventionally, lactation curves of confined dairy cattle have been modelled using non-linear, fixed effects models (MNL). The aims of this study were (i) to assess the fit of non-linear mixedmodels(MMNL),usingtheWood(y = β1xβ2e-β3x) and Wilmink (y = β1 + β2e-0.009x+ β3x) functions to analyse lactation curves under grazing and in the context of heteroscedasticity and correlated errors, and (ii) to evaluate the effect of parity and calving season on the curve parameters for both functions. The Wood and the Wilmink functions were fitted, using MNL and MMNL to 600 milk production records corresponding to 42 lactations from 2004 to 2012 from dairy cattle with 1, 2 or >3 calvings in the wet or dry season from the herd in the IVITA-El Mantaro Research Station (Junin, Perú). For both functions, the MMNL outperformed the MNL in terms of residual standard error reduction, increasing of the likelihood, and being able to model random effects and correlations for all the parameters of both functions. The MMNL was also able to model heteroscedasticity by means of a variance function and correlated errors by means of a spatial correlation function. There were not important differences in the fitting of the Wood or Wilmink functions in terms of the residual standard error or the Akaike or bayesian information criteria. Both, parity and calving season did not have significant effects on the curve parameters of the Wood and Wilmink functions. It is concluded that the MMNL is an excellent tool to model lactation curves both at the population- or individual-level. © 2020 Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.

Additionally, rural livelihoods largely depend on short-term migrants traveling across borders via the Amazon’s river networks to work in extractive industries, such as logging. As a result, there is likely considerable spillover across country borders, particularly along the border between Peru and Ecuador. This border region exhibits a steep gradient of transmission intensity, with Peru having a much higher incidence of malaria than Ecuador. In this paper, we integrate 13 years of weekly malaria surveillance data collected at the district level in Peru and the canton level in Ecuador, and leverage hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal regression models to identify the degree to which malaria transmission in Ecuador is influenced by transmission in Peru. We find that increased case incidence in Peruvian districts that border the Ecuadorian Amazon is associated with increased incidence in Ecuador. Our results highlight the importance of coordinated malaria control across borders. © 2020 by the authors.

There is an urgent need for the conservation of spectacled bear at real time. However, the lack of knowledge about the distribution of this species is considered as one of the major limitations for decision-making and sustainable conservation. In this study, 92 geo-referenced records of the spectacled bear, 12 environmental variables and the MaxEnt entropy modelling have been used for predictive modelling for the current and future (2050 and 2070) potential distribution of the spectacled bear in Amazonas, northeastern Peru. The areas of “high”, “moderate” and “low” potential habitat under current conditions cover 1.99% (836.22 km2), 14.46% (6081.88 km2) and 20.73% (8718.98 km2) of the Amazon, respectively. “High” potential habitat will increase under all climate change scenarios, while “moderate” and “low” potential habitat, as well as total habitat, will decrease over the time. The “moderate”, “low” and total potential habitat are distributed mainly in Yunga montane forest, combined grasslands/rangelands and secondary vegetation and Yunga altimontane (rain) forest, while “high” potential habitat is also concentrated in the Jalca. The overall outcome showed that the most of the important habitats of the spectacled bear are not part of the protected natural areas of Amazonas, under current as well as under future scenarios. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the severe loss of forest cover and rapid reduction of the timber species seriously threaten this ecosystem and biodiversity. In this study, we have modeled the distribution of the ten most exploited timber forest species in Amazonas (Peru) to identify priority areas for forest conservation and restoration. Statistical and cartographic protocols were applied with 4454 species records and 26 environmental variables using a Maximum Entropy model (MaxEnt). The result showed that the altitudinal variable was the main regulatory factor that significantly controls the distribution of the species. We found that nine species are distributed below 1000 m above sea level (a.s.l.), except Cedrela montana, which was distributed above 1500 m a.s.l., covering 40.68%. Eight of 10 species can coexist, and the species with the highest percentage of potential restoration area is Cedrela montana (14.57% from Amazonas). However, less than 1.33% of the Amazon has a potential distribution of some species and is protected under some category of conservation. Our study will contribute as a tool for the sustainable management of forests and will provide geographic information to complement forest restoration and conservation plans. © 2020 by the authors.","Over the years, electricity consumption behavior in Brazil has been analyzed due to financial and social problems. In this context, it is important to simulate energy prices of the energy efficiency auctions in the Brazilian electricitymarket. TheMarkov ChainMonte Carlo (MCMC)method generated simulations; thus, several samples were generated with different sizes. It is possible to say that the larger the sample, the better the approximation to the original data. Then, the Kernel method and the Gaussian mixture model used to estimate the density distribution of energy price, and the MCMC method were crucial in providing approximations of the original data and clearly analyzing its impact. Next, the behavior of the data in each histogram was observed with 500, 1000, 5000 and 10,000 samples, considering only one scenario. The samplewhich best approximates the original data in accordancewith the generated histograms is the 10,000th sample, which consistently follows the behavior of the data. Therefore, this paper presents an approach to generate samples of auction energy prices in the energy efficiency market, using theMCMC method through theMetropolis-Hastings algorithm. The results show that this approach can be used to generate energy price samples. © 2020 by the authors.","Dosidicus gigas is an economically important species distributed in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Unraveling the genetic population structure of this species is crucial to ensure its fishery sustainability and management. Mitochondrial DNA sequences and nuclear neutral loci are useful to understand how historical and contemporary factors drive the genetic population structure of species. However, most studies investigating genetic structuring of D. gigas from its northern and southern populations rely on patterns identified using mitochondrial genes. The use of both types of DNA markers is especially relevant for marine species with high dispersal capabilities such as D. gigas. Here, we describe the genetic structure of D. gigas using partial sequences of the mitochondrial gene NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 and nuclear microsatellite loci in populations of the northern hemisphere from the Costa Rica Thermal Dome and off Ecuador; and, of the southern hemisphere from the South Equatorial Current and off Peru. Statistical parsimony network and Bayesian analyses from mitochondrial sequences revealed three historical maternal lineages in both hemispheres, with high levels of genetic differentiation and signatures of population expansion during the late Pleistocene. Use of Discriminant Analysis of Principal Component (DAPC) with microsatellite loci of mature and immature individuals showed the presence of at least two contemporary genetic stocks homogeneously co-distributed in both northern and southern hemispheres, which can be explained by the biological characteristics of D. gigas and the variable oceanographic conditions of the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Overall, our findings indicate that cooperation between countries with intensive fishing will benefit the sustainability of D. gigas. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Malaria is a vector-borne disease of significant public health concern. Despite widespread success of many elimination initiatives, elimination efforts in some regions of the world have stalled. Barriers to malaria elimination include climate and land use changes, such as warming temperatures and urbanization, which can alter mosquito habitats. Socioeconomic factors, such as political instability and regional migration, also threaten elimination goals. This is particularly relevant in areas where local elimination has been achieved and consequently surveillance and control efforts are dwindling and are no longer a priority. Understanding how environmental change, impacts malaria elimination has important practical implications for vector control and disease surveillance strategies. It is important to consider climate change when monitoring the threat of malaria resurgence due to socioeconomic influences. However, there is limited assessment of how the combination of climate variation, interventions and socioeconomic pressures influence long-term trends in malaria transmission and elimination efforts. In this study, we used Bayesian hierarchical mixed models and malaria case data for a 29-year period to disentangle the impacts of climate variation and malaria control efforts on malaria risk in the Ecuadorian province of El Oro, which achieved local elimination in 2011. We found shifting patterns of malaria between rural and urban areas, with a relative increase of Plasmodium vivax in urbanized areas. Minimum temperature was an important driver of malaria seasonality and the association between warmer minimum temperatures and malaria incidence was greater for Plasmodium falciparum compared to P. vivax malaria. There was considerable heterogeneity in the impact of three chemical vector control measures on both P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria. We found statistically significant associations between two of the three measures [indoor residual spraying (IRS) and space spraying] and a reduction in malaria incidence, which varied between malaria type. We also found environmental suitability for malaria transmission is increasing in El Oro, which could limit future elimination efforts if malaria is allowed to re-establish. Our findings have important implications for understanding environmental obstacles to malaria elimination and highlights the importance of designing and sustaining elimination efforts in areas that remain vulnerable to resurgence. © Copyright © 2020 Fletcher, Stewart-Ibarra, Sippy, Carrasco-Escobar, Silva, Beltran-Ayala, Ordoñez, Adrian, Sáenz, Drakeley, Jones and Lowe.","We examine the phylogenetic relationships among salamanders of the genus Bolitoglossa (Eladinea) distributed in the Amazonian basin of northern Peru and southern Ecuador and assess species diversity based on morphological and phylogenetic analyses. We infer a molecular phylogeny using sequences from two mitochondrial (Cytb, 16S) and two nuclear genes (RAG-1, POMC). We find two well-supported subclades, one including [B. altamazonica + B. peruviana] + B. awajun sp. n., and the other including Bolitoglossa sp. Ituxi + Bolitoglossa sp. Jurúa. Ecuadorian lineages form divergent clades from the Peruvian lineages. Accordingly, Ecuadorian populations previously assigned to Bolitoglossa peruviana sensu lato are treated as members of a Bolitoglossa equatoriana species complex. A newly defined Bolitoglossa altamazonica species complex contains only populations from the Amazonian rainforest of Peru. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian Inference analyses confirm the phylogenetic placement of B. altamazonica and B. peruviana, and support recognition of a related new species of Bolitoglossa. The uncorrected genetic distances between the new species and B. altamazonica are 6.5% for Cytb and 4.9% for 16S; and the uncorrected genetic distances between the new species and B. peruviana are 8.0% for Cytb and 3.9% for 16S. Additionally, analyses of nuclear gene sequences show no haplotype sharing between the new species and closely related species. The new species is distinguished from its congeners by a combination of the following morphological characters: (1) Standard length mean 37.7 mm in males (range 32.0-42.2; n=5) and 41.4 mm in females (range 34.9-48.2; n=6); (2) in life, dorsal coloration uniformly brown with a dark brown triangular marking between the eyes or some irregular light cream spots or patches on the head, back and flanks; (3) iris pale golden; (4) in preservative, dark brown venter with cream mottlings or moderate-sized blotches on the gular region, belly, cloacal region and tail; (5) tips of third finger and third toe protuberant and pointed with nearly complete webbing on the hands and feet; (6) 11-26 maxillary teeth and 8-24 vomerine teeth. Given that the syntypes of B. altamazonica are lost, we designate a neotype for B. altamazonica from Allpahuayo Mishana National Reserve, Loreto department, Peru. Newly collected specimens from ~30 km NE from Moyobamba (type locality of B. peruviana) provide a better understanding of B. peruviana and enable us to show that it is the sister taxon of B. altamazonica. The new species is known from pre-montane forests in Cordillera Escalera Regional Conservation Area, Cordillera Azul National Park and Shucshuyacu, San Martin department, Peru at 485-1311 m elevation, ~75 km SE from Moyobamba.

Forest plantations can be a restoration strategy, while conserving economically important species affected by climate change and providing forestry material for markets. This study modelled the species distribution under current conditions and climate change scenarios of five Timber Forest Species (TFS) in the Amazonas Department, northeastern Peru. Modelling was conducted with Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) using 26 environmental variables. Of the total distribution under current conditions of Cedrelinga cateniformis, Ceiba pentandra, Apuleia leiocarpa, Cariniana decandra and Cedrela montana, 34.64% (2985.51 km2), 37.96% (2155.86 km2), 35.34% (2132.57 km2), 33.30% (1848.51 km2), and 35.81% (6125.44 km2), respectively, correspond to degraded areas and, therefore, there is restoration potential with these species. By 2050 and 2070, all TFS are projected to change their distribution compared to their current ranges, regardless of whether it will be an expansion and/or a contraction. Consequently, this methodology is intended to guide the economic and ecological success of forest plantations in reducing areas degraded by deforestation or similar activities. © 2020 by the authors.","We present data showing that the number of salamander species in Amazonia is vastly underestimated. We used DNA sequences of up to five genes (3 mitochondrial and 2 nuclear) of 366 specimens, 189 corresponding to 89 non-Amazonian nominal species and 177 Amazonian specimens, including types or topotypes, of eight of the nine recognized species in the region. By including representatives of all known species of Amazonian Bolitoglossa, except for one, and 73% of the currently 132 recognized species of the genus, our dataset represents the broadest sample of Bolitoglossa species, specimens, and geographic localities studied to date. We performed phylogenetic analyses using parsimony with tree-alignment and maximum likelihood (ML) with similarity alignment, with indels as binary characters. Our optimal topologies were used to delimit lineages that we assigned to nominal species and candidate new species following criteria that maximize the consilience of the current species taxonomy, monophyly, gaps in branch lengths, genetic distances, and geographic distribution. We contrasted the results of our species-delimitation protocol with those of Automated Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) and multi-rate Poisson Tree Processes (mPTP). Finally, we inferred the historical biogeography of South American salamanders by dating the trees and using dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA). Our results revealed a clade including almost all Amazonian salamanders, with a topology incompatible with just the currently recognized nine species. Following our species-delimitation criteria, we identified 44 putative species in Amazonia. Both ABGD and mPTP inferred more species than currently recognized, but their numbers (23–49) and limits vary. Our biogeographic analysis suggested a stepping-stone colonization of the Amazonian lowlands from Central America through the Chocó and the Andes, with several late dispersals from Amazonia back into the Andes. These biogeographic events are temporally concordant with an early land bridge between Central and South America (~10–15 MYA) and major landscape changes in Amazonia during the late Miocene and Pliocene, such as the drainage of the Pebas system, the establishment of the Amazon River, and the major orogeny of the northern Andes. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Response variables in medical sciences are often bounded, e.g. proportions, rates or fractions of incidence of some disease. In this work, we are interested to study if some characteristics of the population, e.g. sex and race which can explain the incidence rate of colorectal cancer cases. To accommodate such responses, we propose a new class of regression models for bounded response by considering a new distribution in the open unit interval which includes a new parameter to make a more flexible distribution. The proposal is to obtain compound power normal distribution as a base distribution with a quantile transformation of another family of distributions with the same support and then is to study some properties of the new family. In addition, the new family is extended to regression models as an alternative to the regression model with a unit interval response. We also present inferential procedures based on the Bayesian methodology, specifically a Metropolis–Hastings algorithm is used to obtain the Bayesian estimates of parameters. An application to real data to illustrate the use of the new family is considered. © The Author(s) 2019.","This work was originally published in Spanish (1) and has been translated and published without permission or acknowledgement to the original authors.

Developing tools for the genetic identification of Dipteryx species and their geographical origin can help to promote legal trading of timber. A collection of 800 individual trees, belonging to 6 different Dipteryx species, was genotyped based on 171 molecular markers. After the exclusion of markers out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or with no polymorphism or low amplification, 83 nuclear, 29 chloroplast, 13 mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and 2 chloroplast and 5 mitochondrial INDELS remained. Six genetic groups were identified using Bayesian Structure analyses of the nuclear SNPs, which corresponded to the different Dipteryx species collected in the field. Seventeen highly informative markers were identified as suitable for species identification and obtained self-assignment success rates to species level of 78-96%. An additional set of 15 molecular markers was selected to determine the different genetic clusters found in Dipteryx odorata and Dipteryx ferrea, obtaining self-assignment success rates of 91-100%. The success to assign samples to the correct country of origin using all or only the informative markers improved when using the nearest neighbor approach (69-92%) compared to the Bayesian approach (33-80%). While nuclear and chloroplast SNPs were more suitable for differentiating the different Dipteryx species, mitochondrial SNPs were ideal for determining the genetic clusters of D. odorata and D. ferrea. These 32 selected SNPs will be invaluable genetic tools for the accurate identification of species and country of origin of Dipteryx timber. © The American Genetic Association 2020.

In this work, we developed a Bayesian inference for the ZOABR model, providing some contributions, namely: we explored the use of Jeffreys-rule and inde-pendence Jeffreys prior for some of the parameters, performing a sensitivity study of prior choice, comparing the Bayesian estimates with the maximum likelihood ones and measuring the accuracy of the estimates under several scenarios of interest. The results indicate, in a general way, that: the Bayesian approach, under the Jeffreys-rule prior, was as accurate as the ML one. Also, different from other approaches, we use the predictive distribution of the response to implement Bayesian residuals. To further illustrate the advantages of our approach, we conduct an analysis of a real psychometric data set in-cluding a Bayesian residual analysis, where it is shown that misleading inference can be obtained when the data is transformed. That is, when the zeros and ones are transformed to suitable values and the usual beta regression model is considered, instead of the ZOABR model.

Under the Bayesian approach and using information criteria, predictive evaluation measures and introducing the analysis of residuals, we show that the models that use power and reverse power link functions are better than traditional models in the presence of unbalanced data, considering two applications. Additionally, codes with the procedures presented using the Stan package are made available in order to facilitate the use of these models. The work also contains a simulation study that shows how the unbalance in the response variable affects the estimation of the parameters of a logistic regression with respect to the bias, mean square error and standard deviation of the estimates, regardless of the sample size.

New regression models have been proposed in recent years by considering distributions such as the Beta, Simplex and Ku-maraswamy models for this type of data. However, to this type of dataset, it is common to observe the spatial dependence of units. For instance, municipalities or counties are organized into states. For this case, the supposition of independence among observations in the same state removes relevant relations between neighboring provinces. In this paper, we present a model of spatially bounded distribution regression with a Bayesian estimation approach where spatial relations are modeled by a spatial random variable with a particular dependence structure, such as the intrinsic conditional autoregressive model or the Leroux definition. Additionally, the Bayesian inferential method and model comparison criteria are discussed.

In urban settings where vectors are heterogeneously distributed throughout a dense housing matrix, the task of locating infestations can be challenging. Here, we present a novel stochastic compartmental model developed to help locate infested homes in urban areas. We designed the model using infestation data for the Chagas disease vector species Triatoma infestans in Arequipa, Peru. Our approach incorporates disease vector counts at each observed house, and the vector's complex spatial dispersal dynamics. We used a Bayesian method to augment the observed data, estimate the insect population growth and dispersal parameters, and determine posterior infestation probabilities of households. We investigated the properties of the model through simulation studies, followed by field testing in Arequipa. Simulation studies showed the model to be accurate in its estimates of two parameters of interest: the growth rate of a domestic triatomine bug colony and the probability of a triatomine bug successfully invading a new home after dispersing from an infested home. When testing the model in the field, data collection using model estimates was hindered by low household participation rates, which severely limited the algorithm and in turn, the model's predictive power. While future optimization efforts must improve the model's capabilities when household participation is low, our approach is nonetheless an important step toward integrating data with predictive modeling to carry out evidence-based vector surveillance in cities. © 2020 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","A major limitation of road injury research in low- and-middle income countries is the lack of consistent data across the settings, such as traffic counts, to measure traffic risk. This study presents a novel method in which traffic volume of heavy vehicles–trucks and buses–is estimated by identifying these vehicles from satellite imagery of Google Earth. For Rajasthan state in India, a total of ∼44,000 such vehicles were manually identified and geo-located on national highways (NHs), with no distinction made between trucks and buses. To estimate population living in proximity to NHs, defined as those living within 1 km buffer of NH, we geocoded ∼45,000 villages and ∼300 cities using Google Maps Geocoding Application Programming Interface (API). We fitted a spatio-temporal Bayesian regression model with the number of road deaths at the district level as the outcome variable. We found a strong Pearson correlation of 0.84 (p < 0.001) between Google Earth estimates of heavy vehicles and freight vehicle counts reported by a national-level study for different road sections. The regression results show that the volume of heavy vehicles and rural population in proximity to highways are positively associated with fatality risk in the districts. These effects have been estimated after controlling for other modes of travel. © 2020 The Author(s).

Although it has been reported in several localities of both versants of the Peruvian Andes, the potential distribution for this species has not been formally analyzed. Therefore, we describe its distributional pattern in the territory and provide comments about the possible influence of the Andes in its distribution. We gathered occurrence records from museums, acoustic surveys, literature, GBIF and Vertnet sources, and we selected localities to minimize spatial correlation. After defining a minimum-convex polygon of Peruvian records as background area, we use Maxent software with bioclimatic variables to construct species distribution models. Several models were evaluated using different metrics, and the model with the lowest AICc was selected. Then, the model was projected for Peruvian territory. Tadarida brasiliensis is reported for the first time in Cajamarca, Piura and Ica departments. The potential distribution model showed two disjunct suitable areas, one for the Pacific versant and other for the Amazonian versant of the Andes, but connected with moderate suitable conditions in the Huancabamba Depression region in northern Perú. Mean diurnal range and annual mean temperature were identified as the main limiting factors for the potential distribution of this species in this territory. Tadarida brasiliensis exhibits a discontinuous distribution in the Peruvian territory. In northern part, the Huancabamba depression zone has climatic conditions that may allow the east-west dispersal for this species. In central and southern parts, the higher crest of the Andes (> 4,500 m) has low suitable conditions due to the extreme climate. In the eastern, the lowland Amazonian forests has low suitability for this species, probably due to high temperatures. We suggest that the Andes could be acting a biogeographical barrier that limits the dispersal for this species, but population-genetic studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. We identified that temperature is the main climatic factor that limit the dispersal of this bat. In conclusion, T. brasiliensis is mainly associated with desert and Andean slopes ecosystems in Perú, and we highlight the importance of incorporating acoustic records in the analysis of its distribution patterns. © 2020 Asociación Mexicana de Mastozoología, www.mastozoologiamexicana.org.","Response time (RT) models traditionally consider positive continuous distributions, for instance, the lognormal, gamma, exponential, and Weibull distributions, with support < 0, ∞ >.

In this study, we described a new species of sand lizard from the coastal lomas of Quilca, La Chira and Ocoña that belongs to the subgenus Eulaemus and group of Liolaemus montanus, all in the province of Camaná, department of Arequipa, Peru. To determine the taxonomic status of this new organism, we analyzed morphological, molecular and geographical characters. The morphological characters allowed the characterization and diagnosis of the new species, the molecular data was used to make a Bayesian inference, and the geographic data served to determine potential distribution areas. This lizard diverges from the other species of the Liolaemus montanus group for its small to medium size, several sets of morphological characters, folidosis and color pattern. It is also the only species of the genus where the males have a pattern of lateral spots of rounded shape with dark border and green interior, from the armpits to the middle of the body. Additionally, the molecular phylogenetic results made with the Cyt-b gene indicate that it has no direct relationship with the phenetically similar species described for the group; nevertheless, there is a relationship with geographically close populations, which has not been properly described. Finally, it was determined that this lizard has a very marked endemism and its populations are not abundant. © 2020, Universidad de Costa Rica.

We have re-examined the first Plinian phase of this eruption in order to better assess critical eruption source parameters (i.e. erupted volume, plume height, mass eruption rate, eruption duration).The revised bulk volume of the tephra-fall deposit associated with the Plinian phase is approximately 13–14 km3, almost twice the previous estimate (7–8 km3 within the 1 cm isopach) based on methods including power law, Weibull function and Bayesian linear regression. Tephra was dispersed by strong winds to the WNW as far as 400 km on Peruvian territory and then in the Pacific Ocean. Seven villages were buried, killing ~ 1500 people. The revised plume height estimate, 32.2 ± 2.5 km, is consistent with the early estimations. As a result, the Huaynaputina 1600 CE first eruption phase lies in the upper part of the Plinian field close to the ultra-Plinian transition, making this event one of the largest in the past millennium which coincides with results from recent studies on palaeoclimatic impacts. © 2019, International Association of Volcanology & Chemistry of the Earth's Interior.","Background Describing the prevalence and trends of cardiometabolic risk factors that are associated with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is crucial for monitoring progress, planning prevention, and providing evidence to support policy efforts. We aimed to analyse the transition in body-mass index (BMI), obesity, blood pressure, raised blood pressure, and diabetes in the Americas, between 1980 and 2014. Methods We did a pooled analysis of population-based studies with data on anthropometric measurements, biomarkers for diabetes, and blood pressure from adults aged 18 years or older. A Bayesian model was used to estimate trends in BMI, raised blood pressure (systolic blood pressure =140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure =90 mm Hg), and diabetes (fasting plasma glucose =7.0 mmol/L, history of diabetes, or diabetes treatment) from 1980 to 2014, in 37 countries and six subregions of the Americas. Findings 389 population-based surveys from the Americas were available. Comparing prevalence estimates from 2014 with those of 1980, in the non-English speaking Caribbean subregion, the prevalence of obesity increased from 3.9% (95% CI 2.2-6.3) in 1980, to 18.6% (14.3-23.3) in 2014, in men; and from 12.2% (8.2-17.0) in 1980, to 30.5% (25.7-35.5) in 2014, in women. The English-speaking Caribbean subregion had the largest increase in the prevalence of diabetes, from 5.2% (2.1-10.4) in men and 6.4% (2.6-10.4) in women in 1980, to 11.1% (6.4-17.3) in men and 13.6% (8.2-21.0) in women in 2014). Conversely, the prevalence of raised blood pressure has decreased in all subregions; the largest decrease was found in North America from 27.6% (22.3-33.2) in men and 19.9% (15.8-24.4) in women in 1980, to 15.5% (11.1-20.9) in men and 10.7% (7.7-14.5) in women in 2014. Interpretation Despite the generally high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors across the Americas, estimates also showed a high level of heterogeneity in the transition between countries. The increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes observed over time requires appropriate measures to deal with these public health challenges. Our results support a diversification of health interventions across subregions and countries. © 2019 The Author(s).","The Amazonian poison frog genus Ameerega is one of the largest yet most understudied of the brightly colored genera in the anuran family Dendrobatidae, with 30 described species ranging throughout tropical South America. Phylogenetic analyses of Ameerega are highly discordant, lacking consistency due to variation in data types and methods, and often with limited coverage of species diversity in the genus. Here, we present a comprehensive phylogenomic reconstruction of Ameerega, utilizing state-of-the-art sequence capture techniques and phylogenetic methods. We sequenced thousands of ultraconserved elements from over 100 tissue samples, representing almost every described Ameerega species, as well as undescribed cryptic diversity. We generated topologies using maximum likelihood and coalescent methods and compared the use of maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods for estimating divergence times. Our phylogenetic inference diverged strongly from those of previous studies, and we recommend steps to bring Ameerega taxonomy in line with the new phylogeny. We place several species in a phylogeny for the first time, as well as provide evidence for six potential candidate species. We estimate that Ameerega experienced a rapid radiation approximately 7–11 million years ago and that the ancestor of all Ameerega was likely an aposematic, montane species. This study underscores the utility of phylogenomic data in improving our understanding of the phylogeny of understudied clades and making novel inferences about their evolution. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","The scallop Argopecten purpuratus is a heavily exploited resource along the coasts of Peru and north-central Chile, especially after El Niño events, when the species undergoes high increases in abundance. Little is known about its genetic structure or demographic history, two important factors to ensure sustainable exploitation. We sequenced the cytochrome oxidase I and cytochrome b genes of 116 individuals from six localities (between 05°44′S 80°53′W and 23°31′S 70°33′W). We found high levels of genetic diversity in the analyzed populations. No geographical structuring was observed in the haplotype network, which consisted of a few central, widely distributed haplotypes, and many derived population-specific haplotypes separated by few mutations. This pattern suggests a recent population expansion and moderate to low current gene flow among populations. Mismatch analysis, neutrality tests, and a Bayesian skyline analysis confirmed the occurrence of a past event of population expansion approximately 5,000 years ago, which coincides with increasingly stronger and more frequent El Niño events. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Background: Latin America is one of the most unequal regions in the world, but evidence is lacking on the magnitude of health inequalities in urban areas of the region. Our objective was to examine inequalities in life expectancy in six large Latin American cities and its association with a measure of area-level socioeconomic status. Methods: In this ecological analysis, we used data from the Salud Urbana en America Latina (SALURBAL) study on six large cities in Latin America (Buenos Aires, Argentina; Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Santiago, Chile; San José, Costa Rica; Mexico City, Mexico; and Panama City, Panama), comprising 266 subcity units, for the period 2011–15 (expect for Panama city, which was for 2012–16). We calculated average life expectancy at birth by sex and subcity unit with life tables using age-specific mortality rates estimated from a Bayesian model, and calculated the difference between the ninth and first decile of life expectancy at birth (P90–P10 gap) across subcity units in cities. We also analysed the association between life expectancy at birth and socioeconomic status at the subcity-unit level, using education as a proxy for socioeconomic status, and whether any geographical patterns existed in cities between subcity units. Findings: We found large spatial differences in average life expectancy at birth in Latin American cities, with the largest P90–P10 gaps observed in Panama City (15·0 years for men and 14·7 years for women), Santiago (8·9 years for men and 17·7 years for women), and Mexico City (10·9 years for men and 9·4 years for women), and the narrowest in Buenos Aires (4·4 years for men and 5·8 years for women), Belo Horizonte (4·0 years for men and 6·5 years for women), and San José (3·9 years for men and 3·0 years for women). Higher area-level socioeconomic status was associated with higher life expectancy, especially in Santiago (change in life expectancy per P90–P10 change unit-level of educational attainment 8·0 years [95% CI 5·8–10·3] for men and 11·8 years [7·1–16·4] for women) and Panama City (7·3 years [2·6–12·1] for men and 9·0 years [2·4–15·5] for women). We saw an increase in life expectancy at birth from east to west in Panama City and from north to south in core Mexico City, and a core-periphery divide in Buenos Aires and Santiago. Whereas for San José the central part of the city had the lowest life expectancy and in Belo Horizonte the central part of the city had the highest life expectancy. Interpretation: Large spatial differences in life expectancy in Latin American cities and their association with social factors highlight the importance of area-based approaches and policies that address social inequalities in improving health in cities of the region.

Our main goal was to develop a robust habitat suitability model of Amazon-nut and to identify the most important predictor variables to support conservation and tree planting decisions. Localization: Amazon region, South America. Methods: We collected 3,325 unique Amazon-nut records and assembled >100 spatial predictor variables organized across climatic, edaphic, and geophysical categories. We compared suitability models using variables (a) selected through statistical techniques; (b) recommended by experts; and (c) integrating both approaches (a and b). We applied different spatial filtering scenarios to reduce overfitting. We additionally fine-tuned MAXENT settings to our data. The best model was selected through quantitative and qualitative assessments. Results: Principal component analysis based on expert recommendations was the most appropriate method for predictor selection. Elevation, coarse soil fragments, clay, slope, and annual potential evapotranspiration were the most important predictors. Their relative contribution to the best model amounted to 75%. Filtering of the presences within a radius of 10 km displayed lowest overfitting, a satisfactory omission rate and the most symmetric distribution curve. Our findings suggest that under current environmental conditions, suitable habitat for Amazon-nut is found across 2.3 million km2, that is, 32% of the Amazon Biome. Main conclusion: The combination of statistical techniques with expert knowledge improved the quality of our suitability model. Topographic and soil variables were the most important predictors. The combination of predictor variable selection, fine-tuning of model parameters and spatial filtering was critical for the construction of a reliable habitat suitability model. © 2019 The Authors.

The Q α-value prediction of the ten parameter Duflo-Zuker mass model has been improved from a root-mean-square deviation relative to the experimental data σ = 0.43 MeV to σ = 0.122 MeV. This correction brought to light some missing physical aspects in the DZ mass model, so as to identify some magic numbers not present in the original model. By using a phenomenological effective model to deal with alpha decay half-lives, we were able to obtain the half-life values throughout the superheavy elements region. As a main result, we found that the region of greatest stability against the alpha-decay process for superheavy elements is between 106 ≤ Z ≤ 110 and 180 ≤ N ≤ 184. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Item response theory (IRT) models provide an important contribution in the analysis of polytomous items, such as Likert scale items in survey data. We propose a bifactor generalized partial credit model (bifac-GPC model) with flexible link functions - probit, logit and complementary log-log - for use in analysis of ordered polytomous item scale data. In order to estimate the parameters of the proposed model, we use a Bayesian approach through the NUTS algorithm and show the advantages of implementing IRT models through the Stan language. We present an application to marketing scale data. Specifically, we apply the model to a dataset of non-users of a mobile banking service in order to highlight the advantages of this model. The results show important managerial implications resulting from consumer perceptions. We provide a discussion of the methodology for this type of data and extensions.

Using genome-wide and phylogenetic approaches, we investigated osmotin origin and diversification across plant TLP evolution. Genomic and protein in silico analysis tools were also accessed and considered for the study conclusions. Phylogenetic analysis including a total of 722 sequences from 32 Viridiplantae species allowed the identification of an osmotin group that includes all previously characterized osmotins. Based on the phylogenetic tree results, it is evident that the osmotin group emerged from spermatophytes. Phylogenetic separation and gene expansion could be accounted for by an exclusive motif composition and organization that emerged and was maintained following tandem and block duplications as well as natural selection. The TLP family conserved residues and structures that were also identified in the sequences of the osmotin group, thus suggesting their maintenance for defense responses. The gene expression of Arabidopsis and rice putative osmotins reinforces its roles during stress response. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) is a viral disease with considerable negative impact on the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) aquaculture industry. The aim of the present work was to detect genomic regions that explain resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) in rainbow trout. A total of 2,278 fish from 58 full-sib families were challenged with IPNV and 768 individuals were genotyped (488 resistant and 280 susceptible), using a 57K SNP panel Axiom, Affymetrix. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using the phenotypes time to death (TD) and binary survival (BS), along with the genotypes of the challenged fish using a Bayesian model (Bayes C). Heritabilities for resistance to IPNV estimated using genomic information, were 0.53 and 0.82 for TD and BS, respectively. The Bayesian GWAS detected a SNP located on chromosome 5 explaining 19% of the genetic variance for TD. The proximity of Sentrin-specific protease 5 (SENP5) to this SNP makes it a candidate gene for resistance against IPNV. In case of BS, a SNP located on chromosome 23 was detected explaining 9% of the genetic variance. However, the moderate-low proportion of variance explained by the detected marker leads to the conclusion that the incorporation of all genomic information, through genomic selection, would be the most appropriate approach to accelerate genetic progress for the improvement of resistance against IPNV in rainbow trout. © 2019 Genetics Society of America.

The complex geology of the Andes and paleoclimate fluctuations within the Quaternary suggest complex speciation scenarios. This, in turn, has contributed to idiosyncratic speciation modes among shallowly diverged Amazonian taxa. Many relationships among these taxa remain poorly resolved. Here we use a sequence capture approach, ultraconserved elements (UCEs), to address the phylogenetic relationships among three recently diverged Peruvian Ameerega poison frog species (A. cainarachi, A. petersi, and A. smaragdina; family Dendrobatidae)and explore a possible mode of speciation in this group. We assess concordance among concatenated phylogenetic tree inference, gene-tree based species tree inference, SNP-based species tree inference, and Bayes factor lineage delimitation to resolve species boundaries. We complement these analyses with assessments of call divergence to address the presence of a prezygotic reproductive barrier. Additionally, we further explore the phylogeographic history of these species of Ameerega with demographic inference, considering evidence for admixture and population expansions. Our results support the synonymy of A. smaragdina as a junior synonym of A. petersi and we find that speciation in this group is characterized by admixture and signatures of a population bottleneck followed by expansion. We invoke the disturbance-vicariance hypothesis to explain the observed patterns and call for more, detailed investigations of in-situ speciation in the Tropical Andes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Oligoryzomys, as currently understood is formed by 25 living species, is the most diverse genus of the tribe Oryzomyini of the New World subfamily Sigmodontinae of cricetid rodents. Nonetheless, the species richness of Oligoryzomys seems to be an underestimate, given some species complex has been proposed in previous studies, at the time that large geographic areas remain to be sampled, and several taxonomic forms have not been assessed with contemporary approaches. In this study, we present a new assessment of the species diversity of Oligoryzomys based on multiple unilocus species delimitation methods (ABGD, BPP, PTP, GMYC and b GMYC), using 665 cytb gene sequences as evidence (532 gathered from Genbank and 133 obtained in this study). We sampled representatives of almost all currently known species of Oligoryzomys, at the time that extending the geographic coverage to the Central Andes, a large area that was largely unrepresented in previous studies. Phylogenetic relationships, based on a non-redundant alignment, were inferred via maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference; an ultrametric tree, used in species delimitation analyses, was obtained using multiple secondary calibration points. Results of species delimitation methods are discussed at the light of previous knowledge (e.g., taxonomic history and geographic provenance of samples in relation to type localities) and the morphological assessments of some specimens. Results of the distinct delimitation methods are mostly congruent, being BPP and PTP the most sensible to estimate species delimitation, allowing us to suggest that Oligoryzomys is composed of 30 lineages of species level. Of these, 22 correspond to forms currently considered species; some of these include in their synonymy some forms currently considered valid species (e.g., yatesi would be a synonym of longicaudatus). The remaining eight lineages are candidate species that need to be further evaluated. This study, by advancing taxonomic hypothesis that should be further tested in future studies, constitutes a stepping-stone for upcoming taxonomic and biogeographic studies centred on Oligoryzomys. © 2019 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences","Background and Aims: Isolated populations constitute an ideal laboratory to study the consequences of intraspecific divergence, because intrinsic incompatibilities are more likely to accumulate under reduced gene flow. Here, we use a widespread bromeliad with a patchy distribution, Pitcairnia lanuginosa, as a model to infer processes driving Neotropical diversification and, thus, to improve our understanding of the origin and evolutionary dynamics of biodiversity in this highly speciose region. Methods: We assessed the timing of lineage divergence, genetic structural patterns and historical demography of P. lanuginosa, based on microsatellites, and plastid and nuclear sequence data sets using coalescent analyses and an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework. Additionally, we used species distribution models (SDMs) to independently estimate potential changes in habitat suitability. Key Results: Despite morphological uniformity, plastid and nuclear DNA data revealed two distinct P. lanuginosa lineages that probably diverged through dispersal from the Cerrado to the Central Andean Yungas, following the final uplift of the Andes, and passed through long-term isolation with no evidence of migration. Microsatellite data indicate low genetic diversity and high levels of inbreeding within populations, and restricted gene flow among populations, which are likely to be a consequence of bottlenecks (or founder events), and high selfing rates promoting population persistence in isolation. SDMs showed a slight expansion of the suitable range for P. lanuginosa lineages during the Last Glacial Maximum, although molecular data revealed a signature of older divergence. Pleistocene climatic oscillations thus seem to have played only a minor role in the diversification of P. lanuginosa, which probably persisted through adverse conditions in riparian forests. Conclusions: Our results imply drift as a major force shaping the evolution of P. lanuginosa, and suggest that dispersal events have a prominent role in connecting Neotropical open and forest biomes. © 2019 The Author(s).

While Agarophyton vermiculophyllum is a well known example of an algal invader worldwide, its congeneric species A. chilensis has mainly remained within its original distribution range for thousands of years, and was only engaged in a few dispersal journeys to arrive from New Zealand to Chile over 19,000 years ago. Nowadays, A. chilensis is intensively farmed along the Chilean coast and the establishment of new populations has mostly been due to intentional/planned cultivation practices. No other source of range expansion has ever been reported, since its first description. However, in 2014 it was sighted for the first time at the docking of a small artisanal port in Peru, which nowadays represents its northernmost population. We genetically assessed 60 specimens taken from Peru in 2015 and 2017, using two different types of molecular markers (the ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer 2, ITS2 and six nuclear microsatellites). Altogether, our results suggest the population in Perú to be an unattached, vegetative, single male's clonal population. This population has sustained itself successfully, reproducing asexually through fragmentation, for at least four consecutive years and seems to have expanded in the area. The ITS2 sequences from these individuals corresponds all to one haplotype, the one ubiquitous among populations from Chile, the eastern coast of New Zealand and the Chatham Islands, not allowing to narrow down the potential area of origin of the Peruvian population. Based on first the allelic frequencies of six microsatellite loci estimated for 28 Chilean and five loci for seven New Zealander populations and second the analyses of Bayesian clustering, we propose the natural or unintentional anthropogenic introduction of a single male's thallus from Chile to be the source of the Peruvian population. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) models use data from individual item responses to estimate multiple latent traits of interest, making them useful in educational and psychological measurement, among other areas. When MIRT models are applied in practice, it is not uncommon to see that some items are designed to measure all latent traits while other items may only measure one or two traits. In order to facilitate a clear expression of which items measure which traits and formulate such relationships as a math function in MIRT models, we applied the concept of the Q-matrix commonly used in diagnostic classification models to MIRT models. In this study, we introduced how to incorporate a Q-matrix into an existing MIRT model, and demonstrated benefits of the proposed hybrid model through two simulation studies and an applied study. In addition, we showed the relative ease in modeling educational and psychological data through a Bayesian approach via the NUTS algorithm. © The Author(s) 2018.","This article tries to uncover the drivers of soccer players’ market value in the five major European soccer leagues taking into account model uncertainty (variable selection) in a framework with 35 billion potential models. For this purpose, we use a hedonic regression framework and implement Bayesian model averaging (BMA) through Markov chain Monte Carlo model composition (MC3). To deal with endogeneity issues, instrumental variable Bayesian model averaging (IVBMA) is implemented as well. We find very strong, and robust evidence, that the most important value drivers are player’s performance, participation in the national team (senior and under-21), age, and age squared. © The Author(s) 2018.","Araucaria angustifolia is endemic to southern Brazil. Known as Brazilian pine, A. angustifolia is the only native conifer species with economic and social relevance in this country. Due to massive exploitation, it has suffered a significant population decline and currently is classified as critically endangered. This encouraged the scientific community to investigate genetic features in Brazilian pine to increase resources for management and preservation. In this work, RNA-Seq data was used to determine the complete nucleotide sequence of the A. angustifolia chloroplast genome (cpDNA). The cpDNA is 146,203 bp in length and contains 122 genes, including 80 protein-coding genes, 5 ribosomal RNA genes, and 37 tRNA genes. Coding regions comprise 45.02%, 4.96% correspond to rRNAs and tRNAs, and 50.02% of the genome encompasses non-coding regions. Genes found in the inverted repeat (IR) are present as single copy, with exception of the rrn5 and trnI-CAU loci. The typical LSC, SSC, IRa and IRb organization reported in several land-plant groups is not present in A. angustifolia cpDNA. Phylogenetic analyses using Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods clustered A. angustifolia in the Araucariaceae family, with A. heterophylla and A. columnaris as congeneric species. The screening of A. angustifolia cpDNA reveled 100 SSRs, 14 of them corresponding to tetrapolymer loci. © 2019, Brazilian Journal of Genetics.

The study provides a detailed description of the procedure to couple the system ARPS-tTEB and analyzed the simulation results of the 12 January 2015 sea-breeze event that developed a severe thunderstorm above the metropolitan area of São Paulo (MASP), Brazil. The simulation used realistic boundary and initial conditions from the Global Forecast System (GFS) and sea surface temperature (SST) from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM). The system ARPS-tTEB runs of up to 3 km horizontal resolution were carried out with high resolution topography features and land-use types currently available for Southeastern Brazil. The simulated spatial distribution of precipitation was verified against the Climate Prediction Center Morphing Technique (CMORPH), the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) and the São Paulo weather radar (SPWR) precipitation estimates by indexes scores. Time series of grid precipitation estimates (ARPS-tTEB and SPWR) and point measurements (rain gauges) were evaluated with a Bayesian statistical method. Results indicate that the urban area of the MASP modulates the precipitation spatial distribution over it. Furthermore, phase and amplitude precipitation accuracy increased with the 3D urban canyon and the urban energy budget scheme in relationship to control runs without urban environment effects. © 2019 by the authors.","In binary regression, imbalanced data result from the presence of values equal to zero (or one) in a proportion that is significantly greater than the corresponding real values of one (or zero). In this work, we evaluate two methods developed to deal with imbalanced data and compare them to the use of asymmetric links. The results based on simulation study show, that correction methods do not adequately correct bias in the estimation of regression coefficients and that the models with power links and reverse power considered produce better results for certain types of imbalanced data. Additionally, we present an application for imbalanced data, identifying the best model among the various ones proposed. The parameters are estimated using a Bayesian approach, considering the Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo method, utilizing the No-U-Turn Sampler algorithm and the comparisons of models were developed using different criteria for model comparison, predictive evaluation and quantile residuals. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Variation in susceptibility is ubiquitous in multi-host, multi-parasite assemblages, and can have profound implications for ecology and evolution in these systems. The extent to which susceptibility to parasites is phylogenetically conserved among hosts can be revealed by analysing diverse regional communities. We screened for haemosporidian parasites in 3983 birds representing 40 families and 523 species, spanning ~ 4500 m elevation in the tropical Andes. To quantify the influence of host phylogeny on infection status, we applied Bayesian phylogenetic multilevel models that included a suite of environmental, spatial, temporal, life history and ecological predictors. We found evidence of deeply conserved susceptibility across the avian tree; host phylogeny explained substantial variation in infection status, and results were robust to phylogenetic uncertainty. Our study suggests that susceptibility is governed, in part, by conserved, latent aspects of anti-parasite defence. This demonstrates the importance of deep phylogeny for understanding present-day ecological interactions. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","In biomedical studies, the analysis of longitudinal data based on Gaussian assumptions is common practice. Nevertheless, more often than not, the observed responses are naturally skewed, rendering the use of symmetric mixed effects models inadequate. In addition, it is also common in clinical assays that the patient’s responses are subject to some upper and/or lower quantification limit, depending on the diagnostic assays used for their detection. Furthermore, responses may also often present a nonlinear relation with some covariates, such as time. To address the aforementioned three issues, we consider a Bayesian semiparametric longitudinal censored model based on a combination of splines, wavelets, and the skew-normal distribution. Specifically, we focus on the use of splines to approximate the general mean, wavelets for modeling the individual subject trajectories, and on the skew-normal distribution for modeling the random effects.

Due to the diversity in statistical methods, graduate programs need to upgrade in order to form environmental scientists. Here, we test the hypothesis that QUALIS A1 Journals in the Environmental Science area use more complex statistical analyses. We describe the tests offered by graduate programs with PhD degree in Environmental Sciences. A total of 33.5% of 1560 papers evaluated had no statistical analysis. A1 journals used more T-Test, Chi-Square and Mann-Whitney tests than B1 journals. We found no difference between the use of univariate, multivariate and Bayesian analyses. In Brazil, there are 37 graduate programs in Environmental Sciences, of which 10 do not offer statistics course. Among the 38 courses offered, 73.7% provide only univariate statistics and 34.2% provide multivariate statistics. We conclude that quality in papers is not dependable on the complexity of statistical analyses, but on their theoretical framework. © 2019 Centro Universitario de Anapolis.

These large, correlated datasets pose statistical challenges requiring advanced statistical techniques to appropriately interpret and model animal movement. We used satellite telemetry data of critically endangered Eastern Pacific leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) to develop a habitat-based model of their motility (and conversely residence time) using a hierarchical Bayesian framework, which could be broadly applied across species. To account for the spatiotemporally auto-correlated, unbalanced, and presence-only telemetry observations, in combination with dynamic environmental variables, a novel modeling approach was applied. We expanded a Poisson generalized linear model in a continuous-time discrete-space (CTDS) model framework to predict individual leatherback movement based on environmental drivers, such as sea surface temperature. Population-level movement estimates were then obtained with a Bayesian approach and used to create monthly, near real-time predictions of Eastern Pacific leatherback movement in the South Pacific Ocean. This model framework will inform the development of a dynamic ocean management model, “South Pacific TurtleWatch (SPTW),” and could be applied to telemetry data from other populations and species to predict motility and residence times in dynamic environments, while accounting for statistical uncertainties arising at multiple stages of telemetry analysis. © 2019 The Authors.","Asymmetric autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) models and asymmetric stochastic volatility (ASV) models are applied to daily data of Peruvian stock and Forex markets for the period of 5 January 1998-30 December 2011. Following the approach developed in [Omori, Y, S Chib, N Shephard and J Nakajima (2007). Stochastic volatility with leverage: Fast likelihood inference. Journal of Econometrics, 140, 425-449], Bayesian estimation tools are used with Normal and t-Student errors in both models. The results suggest the significant presence of asymmetric effects in both markets. In the stock market, negative shocks generate higher volatility than positive shocks. In the Forex market, shocks related to episodes of depreciation create higher uncertainty in comparison with episodes of appreciation. Thus, the Central Reserve Bank faces relatively major difficulties in its intention of smoothing Forex volatility in times of depreciation. The model with the best fit in both markets is the ASV model with Normal errors. The stock market returns have greater periods of volatility; however, both markets react to shocks in the economy, as they display similar patterns and have a significant correlation for the sample period studied. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Co.","Polytomous Item Response Theory (IRT) models are used by specialists to score assessments and questionnaires that have items with multiple response categories. In this article, we study the performance of five model comparison criteria for comparing fit of the graded response and generalized partial credit models using the same dataset when the choice between the two is unclear. Simulation study is conducted to analyze the sensitivity of priors and compare the performance of the criteria using the No-U-Turn Sampler algorithm, under a Bayesian approach. The results were used to select a model for an application in mental health data. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Supervised learning is an important component of several applications, such as speech recognition, handwritten symbol recognition, data mining, among others. Supervised classification algorithms aim at producing a learning model from a labeled training set. Different methods and approaches have been proposed to overcome the two-class classification problem. Among the existing techniques in literature, the classifier based on Straight Line Segments (SLS Classifier) is worthy of note. This technique is based on distances between points and two sets of straight line segments, whose initial positions are obtained by applying the K-Means algorithm. Then, the gradient descent method finds its optimal positions that minimize the Mean Squared Error. This paper aims to study the impact of the initial positions on the classifier accuracy. For this purpose, we performed two experiments to demonstrate the stability of the classifier performance when the initial positions are not optimal (close to the samples): (i) random initial positions and; (ii) k-means positions displaced by adding Gaussian and uniform noises. In addition, we perform a comparison with positions obtained using different clustering algorithms. As expected, the results suggest that with an increased noise level, the classification rate decreases, however, such reduction was not significant as compared when using the random initial positions. It is worth mentioning that in most of the experiments, the classification rate of the SLS and the Bayes classifier are comparable. © 2018 IEEE.","The taxonomic status of Gastrotheca peruana is evaluated using phylogenetic methods and 16S gene sequences. The maximum likelihood and Bayesian trees showed that the genetic variants of G. peruana form two clades that are not sister to each other. One of these clades is present in northern Perú and includes a specimen collected at the type locality of G. peruana dissimilis. The other clade is restricted to central Peru and contains individuals from type localities of two nominal forms, G. p. peruana and G. p. junensis, and is sister to G. aratia. Our results suggest that G. peruana sensu lato currently encompass two species. We restrict Gastrotheca peruana to populations from central Perú (departments of Ancash, Lima, Pasco and Junín) and assign populations from departments of La Libertad and Cajamarca to Gastrotheca dissimilis. © 2019 Los autores.","A systematic study based on the Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) statistical approach is introduced to improve the predictive power of current nuclear mass formulae when applied to nuclides not yet experimentally detected. In a previous work by the present authors, the methodology was introduced considering only the Duflo-Zuker mass model (Duflo J. and Zuker A., Phys. Rev. C, 52 (1995) R23) to explore the S uperH eavy E lements (SHE) region, with focus on the α-decay process. Due to the discrepancy among different mass formulae we decided to extend in the present calculation the application of the Bayesian Neural Network methodology to other mass formula models and to discussing their implications on predictions of SHE α-decay half-lives. The Qα-value prediction using a set of ten different mass models has been greatly improved for all models when compared to the available experimental data. In addition, we have used the improved Qα-value to determine the SHE α-decay half-lives with a well-succeeded model in the literature, currently employed for different hadronic nuclear decay modes of heavy nuclei, the E ffective L iquid D rop M odel (ELDM). Possible SHE candidates recently investigated are explicitly calculated (specially the 298, 299,300120 isotopes, and results present a promising via of research for these nuclei through α-decay process.

In the Peruvian Amazon, this vector has been expanding to rural communities over the last 10-15 years, but to date, the population genetic structure of Ae. aegypti in this region has not been characterized. To investigate the relationship between Ae. aegypti gene flow and human transportation networks, we characterized mosquito population structure using a panel of 8 microsatellite markers and linked results to various potential mechanisms for long-distance dispersal. Adult and immature Ae. aegypti (>20 individuals per site) were collected from Iquitos city and from six neighboring riverine communities, i.e., Nauta, Indiana, Mazan, Barrio Florida, Tamshiaco, and Aucayo. FST statistics indicate significant, but low to moderate differentiation for the majority of study site pairs. Population structure of Ae. aegypti is not correlated with the geographic distance between towns, suggesting that human transportation networks provide a reasonable explanation for the high levels of population mixing. Our results indicate that Ae. aegypti gene flow among sub-populations is greatest between locations with heavy boat traffic, such as Iquitos-Tamshiaco and Iquitos-Indiana-Mazan, and lowest between locations with little or no boat/road traffic between them such as Barrio Florida-Iquitos. Bayesian clustering analysis showed ancestral admixture among three genetic clusters; no single cluster was exclusive to any site. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that human transportation networks, particularly riverways, are responsible for the geographic spread of Ae. aegypti in the Peruvian Amazon. Our findings are applicable to other regions of the world characterized by networks of urban islands connected by fluvial transport routes. © 2019 This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

In this manuscript, a convenient parametrization of this distribution is proposed in order to develop regression models. This distribution, referred to here as L-Logistic distribution, provides great flexibility and includes the uniform distribution as a particular case. Several properties of this distribution are studied, and a Bayesian approach is adopted for the parameter estimation. Simulation studies, considering prior sensitivity analysis, recovery of parameters and comparison of algorithms, and robustness to outliers are all discussed showing that the results are insensitive to the choice of priors, efficiency of the algorithm MCMC adopted, and robustness of the model when compared with the beta distribution. Applications to estimate the vulnerability to poverty and to explain the anxiety are performed. The results to applications show that the L-Logistic regression models provide a better fit than the corresponding beta regression models. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2019.","The Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens) is the most important small pelagic of the Humboldt Current System (HCS), supporting the largest mono-specific fishery in the world. The spatial behavior of this species tends to be very dynamic at different spatial scales, influenced mostly by its biomass level and environmental factors. The aim of this study was to analyze temporal and spatial fluctuations in anchovy spatial distribution off Peru, based and modeled on acoustic data, focusing on large- and meso-scale spatial structures. We employed data from 41 scientific surveys (1994–2016) and Bayesian hierarchical spatial models to obtain the anchovy's spatial distribution, allowing us to identify spatial structures at specific scales. Our results showed similar temporal trends in the number of mesoscale structures, their areas and anchovy density, exhibiting altogether two breakpoints in the time series: ~1999 and ~2013. The last period (2013–2016) was similar to the earlier one (1994–1999), in terms of low values of mesoscale structure indicators. On the other hand, we identified four spatial scenarios differentiated by the aggregative behavior, which were highly influenced by seasons and El Niño events. Each scenario had recurrent, or fidelity, areas placed in different locations. For instance, for the ‘El Niño scenario’ a particularly coastal recurrent area was identified, which might be a refuge zone for this species during these unfavorable events. Finally, we assessed differences in biomass estimates of each scenario. The highest biomass values were estimated for the ‘Summer favorable scenario’ and the lowest ones for the ‘El Niño scenario’ which supports the MacCall's basin hypothesis for this species. This study expands the current knowledge of the Peruvian anchovy and it is a first step to understand the effects on this species of the last El Niño events (2014–2016) that occurred in the northern Humboldt Current System. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Antecedentes y Objetivos: El conocimiento de la riqueza y distribución de la flora en los Andes peruanos es escaso; en la última década han habido alrededor de 70 novedades taxonómicas para esta área, siendo la familia Asteraceae la de mayor aporte.

The objective of this paper is to contribute to the knowledge of this flora through a new record of Baccharis acaulis. In addition, the distribution pattern of this species is examined. Methods: As part of floristic inventories in the high Andes of Peru, various field trips were carried out, several plant specimens were collected, among them a previously unreported species, which was identified by consulting some specialists and confirmed using taxonomic keys. Furthermore, predicting species distribution based on ecological niche modeling was made use the machine learning algorithm Maxent with the bioclimatic variables of the WorldClim database. Key results: A species of the genus Baccharis was registered for the first time for the flora of Peru. This species is recognized for its unique habit; it is a rhizomatous herb in which the aboveground part consists of small leaf rosettes surrounding a solitary capitulum. The species was collected in the south of the Peruvian Andes. This record extends the known distribution of the species considerably to the north. Conclusions: This record suggests the need to continue studying the Andean flora, as well as the links of their distribution patterns with the phytogeographical regions. © 2018, Instituto de Ecologiao.","Multiple factors contribute to the negative experience and disinterest of medical students on the perception of the Microbiology course [1]. In this paper, an Adaptive Serious Game is proposed as a more entertaining educational approach to motivate and to improve the performance of medical students on a Microbiology subject. To achieve that, a Bayesian Network model constructed from expert knowledge and a Role-Playing game design were proposed. To validate our proposal, a playability survey was applied to 36 college students. These students were divided in two groups for evaluating their performance with and without an adaptability feature. Overall, the results suggest the game is attractive, enjoyable and useful tool for learning. Moreover, the use of Bayesian networks contributes to the success performance ratio of the students. © 2018 IEEE.","Fraud detection is important for financial institutions and the society. Supervised machine learning techniques were applied for fraud detection. However, mostly discriminative techniques were applied on these problems. Probabilistic graphical models can also detect fraud, providing also a graphical representation of its reasoning scheme as a graph. We proposed a method to generate a probabilistic graphical model for fraud detection, using constraints related to the domain. We achieved 99.272% of accuracy and we outperformed other baselines techniques of probabilistic graphical models. We demonstrated that constraints are important to tackle complex problem such a fraud detection. © 2018 IEEE.","Efficient detection of multiple species of adult mosquitoes in various habitats using effective traps is a crucial 1st step in any disease prevention program. Novel trap types that target tropical vectors of human diseases require field testing in the habitat of the vector-disease system in question. This paper analyzes a series of mosquito trapping studies conducted at Mapacocha, San Juan Bautista District, Loreto, Peru, during August- September 2013 and April-May 2014. Six trap configurations were evaluated in forest and rural locations. Adult mosquito counts were analyzed using full Bayesian inference of multilevel generalized linear models and posterior probability point estimates of the difference of means of the combined trap catch by trap type comparisons of all species. Light traps (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] incandescent, white light-emitting diode [LED], and ultraviolet LED) caught greater numbers of mosquitoes compared with traps baited with yeast-generated CO2 and Biogents Sentinele traps (battery powered traps without light and passive box traps). However, diversity measures (species richness, evenness, and similarity) were consistently nearly equal among trap types. Arbovirus vectors were more common in forest locations, while malaria vectors were more common near human habitations. Location had a significant effect on trap effectiveness and mosquito diversity, with traps from forest locations having greater numbers and greater species richness, compared with traps set near human habitations. The results of this study will inform mosquito surveillance trap choices in remote regions of central South America, including regions with emerging tropical diseases, such and dengue and Zika virus. © 2018 by The American Mosquito Control Association, Inc.","The Peruvian anchovy is an important species from an ecological and economical perspective. Some important features to evaluate fisheries management are the relationship between the anchovy presence/abundance and covariates with spatial and temporal dependencies accounted for, the nature of the behaviour of anchovy throughout space and time, and available spatio-temporal predictions. With these challenges in mind, we propose to use flexible Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal models for zero-inflated positive continuous data. These models are able to capture the spatial and temporal distribution of the anchovies, to make spatial predictions within the temporal range of the data and predictions about the near future. To make our modelling computationally feasible we use the stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) approach combined with the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) method. After balancing goodness of fit, interpretations of spatial effects across years, prediction ability, and computational costs, we suggest to use a model with a spatio-temporal structure. Our model provides a novel method to investigate the Peruvian anchovy dynamics across years, giving solid statistical support to many descriptive ecological studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","This study is one of the first to utilize the stochastic volatility (SV) model to modelling the Peruvian financial times series. We estimate and compare this model with generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models with normal and t-student errors. The analysis in this study corresponds to Peru’s stock market and exchange rate returns. The importance of this methodology is that the adjustment of the data is better than the GARCH models, using the assumptions of normality in both models. In the case of the SV model, three Bayesian algorithms have been employed where we evaluate their respective inefficiencies in the estimation of the model’s parameters—the most efficient being the integration sampler. The estimated parameters in the SV model under the various algorithms are consistent, as they display little inefficiency. The figures of the correlations of the iterations suggest that there are no problems at the time of Markov chaining in all estimations. We find that the volatilities in the exchange rate and stock market volatilities follow similar patterns over time. That is, when economic turbulence caused by the economic circumstances occurred, for example, the Asian crisis and the recent crisis in the USA, considerable volatility was generated in both markets.

Inhabiting terrestrial and aquatic environments, most are free-living saprophytes but several species cause important diseases: e.g. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, responsible for worldwide amphibian decline; and Synchytrium endobioticum, causing potato wart disease. S. endobioticum has an obligate biotrophic lifestyle and isolates can be further characterized as pathotypes based on their virulence on a differential set of potato cultivars. Quarantine measures have been implemented globally to control the disease and prevent its spread. We used a comparative approach using chytrid mitogenomes to determine taxonomical relationships and to gain insights into the evolution and recent history of introductions of this plant pathogen. RESULTS: We assembled and annotated the complete mitochondrial genome of 30 S. endobioticum isolates and generated mitochondrial genomes for five additional chytrid species. The mitochondrial genome of S. endobioticum is linear with terminal inverted repeats which was validated by tailing and PCR amplifying the telomeric ends. Surprisingly, no conservation in organisation and orientation of mitochondrial genes was observed among the Chytridiomycota except for S. endobioticum and its sister species Synchytrium microbalum. However, the mitochondrial genome of S. microbalum is circular and comprises only a third of the 72.9 Kbp found for S. endobioticum suggesting recent linearization and expansion. Four mitochondrial lineages were identified in the S. endobioticum mitochondrial genomes. Several pathotypes occur in different lineages, suggesting that these have emerged independently. In addition, variations for polymorphic sites in the mitochondrial genome of individual isolates were observed demonstrating that S. endobioticum isolates represent a community of different genotypes. Such communities were shown to be complex and stable over time, but we also demonstrate that the use of semi-resistant potato cultivars triggers a rapid shift in the mitochondrial haplotype associated with increased virulence. CONCLUSIONS: Mitochondrial genomic variation shows that S. endobioticum has been introduced into Europe multiple times, that several pathotypes emerged multiple times, and that isolates represent communities of different genotypes. Our study represents the most comprehensive dataset of chytrid mitogenomes, which provides new insights into the extraordinary dynamics and evolution of mitochondrial genomes involving linearization, expansion and reshuffling.","Background: Congregate settings may serve as institutional amplifiers of tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). We analyze spatial, epidemiological, and pathogen genetic data prospectively collected from neighborhoods surrounding a prison in Lima, Peru, where inmates experience a high risk of MDR-TB, to investigate the risk of spillover into the surrounding community. Methods: Using hierarchical Bayesian statistical modeling, we address three questions regarding the MDR-TB risk: (i) Does the excess risk observed among prisoners also extend outside the prison? (ii) If so, what is the magnitude, shape, and spatial range of this spillover effect? (iii) Is there evidence of additional transmission across the region? Results: The region of spillover risk extends for 5.47km outside of the prison (95% credible interval: 1.38, 9.63km). Within this spillover region, we find that nine of the 467 non-inmate patients (35 with MDR-TB) have MDR-TB strains that are genetic matches to strains collected from current inmates with MDR-TB, compared to seven out of 1080 patients (89 with MDR-TB) outside the spillover region (p values: 0.022 and 0.008). We also identify eight spatially aggregated genetic clusters of MDR-TB, four within the spillover region, consistent with local transmission among individuals living close to the prison. Conclusions: We demonstrate a clear prison spillover effect in this population, which suggests that interventions in the prison may have benefits that extend to the surrounding community. © 2018 The Author(s).","Using daily stocks returns data of a set of Latin-American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru) for the sample period 1996:01–2013:12, we estimate a stochastic volatility model incorporating both leverage effects and skewed heavy-tailed disturbances through of the GH Skew Student's t-distribution based on Bayesian estimation method proposed by Nakajima and Omori (2012). Two alternative models are estimated, one using an alternative Skew Student's t-distribution and the other using a symmetric Student's t-distribution. The results suggest the presence of leverage effects in all markets except for Peru where the evidence is unclear. In addition, there is evidence of asymmetries and heavy tails in the Argentina and S&P500 markets while in the other countries there is no robust evidence of such characteristics. Using the Bayes factor, the results indicate that the SVGHSkewt model dominates the other two models for the cases of Peru, Argentina, Brazil and S&P500 whereas the simple SVt model is preferred for the markets of Mexico and Chile. Similar findings are obtained after performing a robustness analysis regarding the priors of the parameters associated with the skewness and the tails of the distribution. © 2018 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","Background: Plasmodium vivax poses a significant challenge to malaria elimination due to its ability to cause relapsed infections from reactivation of dormant liver parasites called hypnozoites. We analyzed 69 P. vivax whole genome sequences obtained from subjects residing in three different villages along the Peruvian Amazon. This included 23 paired P. vivax samples from subjects who experienced recurrent P. vivax parasitemia following observed treatment with chloroquine and primaquine. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples collected from subjects. P. vivax DNA was enriched using selective whole genome amplification and whole genome sequencing. We used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the core P. vivax genome to determine characteristics of the parasite population using discriminant analysis of principal components, maximum likelihood estimation of individual ancestries, and phylogenetic analysis. We estimated the relatedness of the paired samples by calculating the number of segregating sites and using a hidden Markov model approach to estimate identity by descent. Results: We present a comprehensive dataset of population genetics of Plasmodium vivax in the Peruvian Amazonian. We define the parasite population structure in this region and demonstrate a novel method for distinguishing homologous relapses from reinfections or heterologous relapses with improved accuracy. The parasite population in this area was quite diverse with an estimated five subpopulations and evidence of a highly heterogeneous ancestry of some of the isolates, similar to previous analyses of P. vivax in this region. Pairwise comparison of recurrent infections determined that there were 12 homologous relapses and 3 likely heterologous relapses with highly related parasites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to evaluate recurrent P. vivax infections using whole genome sequencing. Conclusions: Whole genome sequencing is a high-resolution tool that can identify P. vivax homologous relapses with increased sensitivity, while also providing data about drug resistance and parasite population genetics. This information is important for evaluating the efficacy of known and novel antirelapse medications in endemic areas and thus advancing the campaign to eliminate malaria. © 2018 The Author(s).","In this article we propose a new mixed-effects regression model for fractional bounded response variables. Our model allows us to incorporate covariates directly to the expected value, so we can quantify exactly the influence of these covariates in the mean of the variable of interest rather than to the conditional mean. Estimation is carried out from a Bayesian perspective. Due to the complexity of the augmented posterior distribution, we use a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm, the No-U-Turn sampler, implemented using the Stan software. A simulation study was performed showing that our model has a better performance than other traditional longitudinal models for bounded variables. Finally, we applied our beta-inflated mean mixed-effects regression model to real data which consists of utilization of credit lines in the peruvian financial system. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Background: The transmission dynamics of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in tropical countries remain unclear. Further understanding of the genetic diversity of the virus could aid in HMPV vaccine design and improve our understanding of respiratory virus transmission dynamics in low- and middle-income countries. Materials & Methods: We examined the evolution of HMPV in Peru through phylogenetic analysis of 61 full genome HMPV sequences collected in three ecologically diverse regions of Peru (Lima, Piura, and Iquitos) during 2008-2012, comprising the largest data set of HMPV whole genomes sequenced from any tropical country to date. Results: We revealed extensive genetic diversity generated by frequent viral introductions, with little evidence of local persistence. While considerable viral traffic between non-Peruvian countries and Peru was observed, HMPV epidemics in Peruvian locales were more frequently epidemiologically linked with other sites within Peru. We showed that Iquitos experienced greater HMPV traffic than the similar sized city of Piura by both Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods. Conclusions: There is extensive HMPV genetic diversity even within smaller and relatively less connected cities of Peru and this virus is spatially fluid. Greater diversity of HMPV in Iquitos compared to Piura may relate to higher volumes of human movement, including air traffic to this location. © 2017 The Authors.

Coupling top predators’ population studies with independent records of prey abundance suggests that prey fluctuations affect fecundity parameters and abundance of their predators. However, prey may be abundant but inaccessible to their predators and a major challenge is to determine the relative importance of prey accessibility in shaping seabird populations. In addition, disentangling the effects of prey abundance and accessibility from the effects of prey removal by fisheries, while accounting for density dependence, remains challenging for marine top predators. Here, we investigate how climate, population density, and the accessibility and removal of prey (the Peruvian anchovy Engraulis ringens) by fisheries influence the population dynamics of the largest sedentary seabird community (≈ 4 million individuals belonging to guanay cormorant Phalacrocorax bougainvillii, Peruvian booby Sula variegata and Peruvian pelican Pelecanus thagus) of the northern Humboldt Current System over the past half-century. Using Gompertz state–space models we found strong evidence for density dependence in abundance for the three seabird species. After accounting for density dependence, sea surface temperature, prey accessibility (defined by the depth of the upper limit of the subsurface oxygen minimum zone) and prey removal by fisheries were retained as the best predictors of annual population size across species. These factors affected seabird abundance the current year and with year lags, suggesting effects on several demographic parameters including breeding propensity and adult survival. These findings highlight the effects of prey accessibility and fishery removals on seabird populations in marine ecosystems. This will help refine management objectives of marine ecosystems in order to ensure sufficient biomass of forage fish to avoid constraining seabird population dynamics, while taking into account of the effects of environmental variability. © 2017 The Authors","Deforestation-reinforced by illegal logging-is a serious problem in many tropical regions and causes pervasive environmental and economic damage. Existing laws that intend to reduce illegal logging need efficient, fraud resistant control methods. We developed a genetic reference database for Jatoba (Hymenaea courbaril), an important, high value timber species from the Neotropics. The data set can be used for controls on declarations of wood origin. Samples from 308 Hymenaea trees from 12 locations in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and French Guiana have been collected and genotyped on 10 nuclear microsatellites (nSSRs), 13 chloroplast SNPs (cpSNP), and 1 chloroplast indel marker. The chloroplast gene markers have been developed using Illumina DNA sequencing. Bayesian cluster analysis divided the individuals based on the nSSRs into 8 genetic groups. Using self-assignment tests, the power of the genetic reference database to judge on declarations on the location has been tested for 3 different assignment methods. We observed a strong genetic differentiation among locations leading to high and reliable self-assignment rates for the locations between 50% to 100% (average of 88%). Although all 3 assignment methods came up with similar mean self-assignment rates, there were differences for some locations linked to the level of genetic diversity, differentiation, and heterozygosity. Our results show that the nuclear and chloroplast gene markers are effective to be used for a genetic certification system and can provide national and international authorities with a robust tool to confirm legality of timber. © 2018 The American Genetic Association.

Estimating the potential epidemiological impact of a product requires thorough understanding of these effects and their interplay at different dosages. Volatile spatial repellent (SR) products come with an additional layer of complexity due to the potential for altered movement of affected mosquitoes and diffusion of volatile particles of the product beyond the treated house. Here, we propose a paired experimental design and statistical inference framework for estimating these nuanced effects of volatile SRs. Method: We fitted a continuous-time Markov chain model in a Bayesian framework to data on marked mosquitoes released in interconnected experimental huts conducted in Iquitos, Peru. We estimated the effects of two dosages of transfluthrin on Ae. aegypti behaviors associated with human-vector contact: repellency, exiting and knockdown in the treated space and in connected, adjacent huts. We validated the framework using simulated data. Results: The odds of a female Ae. aegypti being repelled, and thus prevented from entering a treated hut (H T), increased at both dosages (low dosage: odds = 1.64, 95% highest density interval (HDI) = 1.30-2.09; high dosage: odds = 1.35, HDI = 1.04-1.67). The relative risk of exiting from the treated hut was reduced (low: RR = 0.70, HDI = 0.62-1.09; high: RR = 0.70, HDI = 0.40-1.06), with this effect carrying over to untreated spaces two huts away from the treated hut (H 2) (low: RR = 0.79, HDI = 0.59-1.01; high: RR = 0.66, HDI = 0.50-0.87). Knockdown rates were increased in both treated and downstream huts, particularly under high dosage (H T: RR = 8.37, HDI = 2.11-17.35; H 1: RR = 1.39, HDI = 0.52-2.69; H 2: RR = 2.22, HDI = 0.96-3.86). Conclusions: Our framework is effective at elucidating multiple effects of volatile chemicals used in SR products, as well as their downstream effects. For the examined formulations of transfluthrin, we found notable dose-dependent effects on repellency, movement and knockdown that carry over to adjacent, untreated spaces. © 2018 The Author(s).","Background: Humans threat the populations of tree species by overexploitation, deforestation, land use change, and climate change. We present a novel threat assessment at intraspecific level to support the conservation of genetic resources of 80 socioeconomically viable tree species in South America. In this assessment, we evaluate the threat status of Ecogeographic Range Segments (ERSs). ERSs are groups of populations of a specific species in a certain ecological zone of a particular grid cell of a species’ geographic occupancy. Methods: We used species location records to determine the species distributions and species-specific ERSs. We distinguished eight threat situations to assess the risk of extirpation of the ERSs of all 80 species. These threat situations were determined by large or little tree cover, low or high human pressure, and low or high climate change impact. Available layers of tree cover and threats were used to determine the levels of fragmentation and direct human pressure. Maxent niche modelling with two Global Circulation Models helped determining climate change impact by the 2050s. Results: When all 80 species are considered, in total, 59% of the ERSs are threatened by little tree cover or high human pressure. When climate change is also considered, then 71-73% of the ERSs are threatened. When an increased risk of extirpation of populations outside protected areas is considered, then 84–86% of the ERSs are threatened. Seven species warrant special attention because all their ERSs are threatened across their whole distribution in South America: Balfourondendron riedelianum, Cariniana legalis, Dalbergia nigra, Handroanthus pulcherrimus, Pachira quintana, Prosopis flexuosa, and Prosopis pallida. Conclusions: Our results confirm the urgency to set up a regional action plan for the conservation of tree genetic resources in South America. With this threat assessment, we aim to support governments and organizations who are taking up this task. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Magnolia mercedesiarum, a new species from the eastern slopes of the Andes in northern Ecuador, is described and illustrated, and a key to Ecuadorian Magnolia (subsect.

We conduct a simulation study in order to evaluate the parameter recovery and efficiency of this new Markov chain Monte Carlo method and to compare it with two other Bayesian methods, the Metropolis Hastings and Gibbs sampling algorithms, and with a frequentist method, using the Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm. The results indicated that NUTS algorithm employed in the DINA model properly recovers all parameters and is accurate for all simulated scenarios. We apply this methodology in the mental health area in order to develop a new method of classification for respondents to the Beck Depression Inventory. The implementation of this method for the DINA model applied to other psychological tests has the potential to improve the medical diagnostic process. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Morphological and phylogenetic evidence supports a close relationship between Nectouxia and the Andean genus Salpichroa, but the phylogenetic analyses completed to date have included very few Salpichroa species. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis including Nectouxia and all Salpichroa species was carried out to shed light on the relationship between the two genera. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference analyses were done using sequences from three markers (ITS, psbA-trnH, and ndhF-rpL32). The results of both analyses are congruent regarding the strongly supported clades while incongruences are observed in weakly supported clades that can be explained by rapid species radiation. Salpichroa species are divided in two main clades with strong support, while Nectouxia is resolved within one of them. Our results indicate that the two genera should be combined into a single genus or Salpichroa will be paraphyletic as currently circumscribed. The name Nectouxia has priority but the conservation of Salpichroa has been proposed. At the suprageneric level, the Nectouxia + Salpichroa clade is not closely related to Jaborosa, which is further evidence that the previously recognized tribe Jaboroseae is not monophyletic. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.","Climatic and oceanographic events occurring during the last glacial cycle in the Humboldt Current System (HCS) have left genetic footprints in marine invertebrate populations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the glacial period on Octopus mimus populations found throughout the HCS. This species lays a large number of small eggs which hatch into planktonic paralarvae with the potential to undergo wide dispersal. We sequenced the COIII gene to perform phylogeographic analyses of 197 octopuses sampled from seven localities. The genetic diversity of Octopus mimus was low and decreased towards the southern end of the distribution range, which comprises a single population. The haplotype genealogy and Bayesian Skyride plot suggest that O. mimus underwent a demographic expansion after the last glacial maximum (LGM). This would imply a contraction of the range of this organism toward northern latitudes during the LGM followed by southward expansion and recolonization once the contemporary interglacial period began. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","This paper presents a new statistical toolkit by applying three techniques for data-driven causal inference from the machine learning community that are little- known among economists and innovation scholars: a conditional independencebased approach, additive noise models, and non-algorithmic inference by hand.

The analysis ofthe intraspecific patterns of genetic structure in plants would permit inferring theeffects of Andean uplift on the evolution and diversification of Neotropical flora. Inthis study, using microsatellite markers and Bayesian clustering analyses, we reportthe presence of four genetic clusters for the palm Oenocarpus bataua var. batauawhich are located within four biogeographic regions in northwestern South America:(a) Chocó rain forest, (b) Amotape-Huancabamba Zone, (c) northwestern Amazonianrain forest, and (d) southwestern Amazonian rain forest. We hypothesize that theseclusters developed following three genetic diversification events mainly promoted byAndean orogenic events. Additionally, the distinct current climate dynamics amongnorthwestern and southwestern Amazonia may maintain the genetic diversificationdetected in the western Amazon basin. Genetic exchange was identified betweenthe clusters, including across the Andes region, discarding the possibility of any cluster to diversify as a distinct intraspecific variety. We identified a hot spot of geneticdiversity in the northern Peruvian Amazon around the locality of Iquitos. We alsodetected a decrease in diversity with distance from this area in westward and southward direction within the Amazon basin and the eastern Andean foothills. Additionally,we confirmed the existence and divergence of O. bataua var. bataua from var. oligocarpus in northern South America, possibly expanding the distributional range of thelatter variety beyond eastern Venezuela, to the central and eastern Andean cordilleras of Colombia. Based on our results, we suggest that Andean orogenesis is themain driver of genetic structuring and diversification in O. bataua within northwestern South America. © 2018 The Authors.","Cyberbullying is a growing problem in our society that can bring fatal consequences and can be presented in digital text for example at online social networks. Nowadays there is a wide variety of works focused on the detection of digital texts in the English language, however in the Spanish language there are few studies that address this issue. This paper aims to detect this cybernetic harassment in social networks, in Spanish language. Sentiment analysis techniques are used, such as bag of words, elimination of signs and numbers, tokenization and stemming, as well as a Bayesian classifier. The data used for the training of the Bayesian classifier were obtained from the Spanish Dictionary of Affect in Language (SDAL), which is a database formed by more than 2500 words manually evaluated in three affective dimensions: Pleasantness, activation and imagery, as well as same 595 words obtained following the same procedure of SDAL was used with the help of the members of the Research Center, Technology Transfer and Software Development.

Two hundred and fifty accessions, representing paired samples consisting of original mother plants and their in vitro counterparts from the cultivated potato collection at the International Potato Center (CIP) were fingerprinted using the Infinium 12K V2 Potato Array to confirm genetic identity of the accessions and evaluate genetic diversity of the potato collection. Diploid, triploid, and tetraploid accessions were included, representing seven cultivated potato taxa (based on Hawkes, 1990). Fingerprints between voucher mother plants maintained in the field and in vitro clones of the same accession were used to evaluate identity, relatedness, and ancestry using hierarchal clustering and model-based Bayesian admixture analyses. Generally, in vitro and field clones of the same accession grouped together; however, 11 (4.4%) accessions were mismatches genetically, and in some cases the SNP data revealed the identity of the mixed accession. SNP genotypes were used to assess genetic diversity and to evaluate inter- and intraspecific relationships along with determining population structure and hybrid origins. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the triploids included in this study are genetically similar. Further, some genetic redundancies among individual accessions were also identified along with some putative misclassified accessions. Accessions generally clustered together based on taxonomic classification and ploidy level with some deviations. STRUCTURE analysis identified six populations with significant gene flow among the populations, as well as revealed hybrid taxa and accessions. Overall, the Infinium 12K V2 Potato Array proved useful in confirming identity and highlighting the diversity in this subset of the CIP collection, providing new insights into the accessions evaluated. This study provides a model for genetic identity of plant genetic resources collections as mistakes in conservation of these collections and in genebanks is a reality. For breeders and other users of these collections, confirmed identity is critical, as well as for quality management programs and to provide insights into the accessions evaluated. © 2018 Canadian Science Publishing.

To better understand the transmission dynamics of P. vivax populations in the PNC and the neighboring Ecuadorian Amazon Basin (EAB), we studied the genetic variability and population structure of P. vivax in these areas. One hundred and twenty P. vivax isolates (58 from Piura and 37 from Tumbes in thePNCcollected from 2008 to 2010 and 25 from theEAB collected in Pastaza from 2001 to 2004) were assessed by five polymorphic microsatellite markers. Genetic variability was determined by expected heterozygosity (He) and population structure by Bayesian inference cluster analysis.Wefound very low genetic diversity in the PNC (He = 0-0.32) but high genetic diversity in the EAB (He = 0.43-0.70). Population structure analysis revealed three distinct populations in the three locations. Six of 37 (16%) isolates from Tumbes had an identical haplotype to that found in Piura, suggesting unidirectional flow from Piura to Tumbes. In addition, one haplotype from Tumbes showed similarity to a haplotype found in Pastaza, suggesting that this could be an imported case from EAB. These findings strongly suggest a minimal population flow and different levels of genetic variability between these two areas divided by the Andes Mountains. This work presents molecular markers that could be used to increase our understanding of regional malaria transmission dynamics, which has implications for the development of strategies for P. vivax control.

The present study aims to provide basic information regarding the isotopic niche and trophic interactions of four pelagic elasmobranchs of commercial importance in northern Peru (Alopias spp., Galeorhinus galeus, Sphyrna zygaena, and Mobula japanica). One hundred and twenty-four samples were collected from fishing activities between January and December 2015 and processed for stable isotopes analysis (δ13C and δ15N), using Bayesian statistics to describe their isotopic niche. Differences between species were assessed using PERMANOVA and PERMDISP, allowing testing length, sex, and latitude as covariates. These combined results suggest trophic redundancy among sharks. However, unique areas of no overlap in the SEAC of all species could evidence a broad niche with a low interaction between these sharks. M. japanica had no overlap with any shark species, which indicates a trophic niche that is distinct from other elasmobranch top predators. Increasing sample size and including temporal covariates should help define these isotopic niches better, either by merging or splitting the studied elasmobranchs into more specific groupings. Further complementary studies are required to better understand trophic interactions within the pelagic community ecosystems. © 2018, Escuela de Ciencias del Mar.

Bayesian clustering and genetic distance-based methods were used based on nine microsatellite loci in 377 individuals of three main putative species of the complex. The resulting genetic clusters were assessed for ecological niche divergence and areolar morphology, particularly spination patterns. We based our species boundaries on concordance between genetic, ecological, and morphological data, and were able to resolve four species, three of them corresponding to S. pruinosus from central Mexico, S. laevigatus from southern Mexico, and S. griseus from northern South America. A fourth species, previously considered to be S. griseus and commonly misidentified as S. pruinosus in northern Mexico showed significant genetic, ecological, and morphological differentiation suggesting that it should be considered a new species, S. huastecorum, which we describe here. We show that population genetic analyses, ecological niche modeling, and morphological studies are complementary approaches for delimiting species in taxonomically challenging plant groups such as the SGSC. © 2018 Alvarado-Sizzo et al.

Further, two sets of high-frequency data are also used. The model is a parametric state-space model with an estimation framework that combines long memory and level shifts by decomposing the underlying process into a mixture model and ARFIMA dynamics. The results of the estimates are not conclusive as those obtained in Varneskov and Perron (2017a,b). In fact, the very small magnitudes of the fractional parameter estimates suggest that only the high-frequency series could be modeled as RLS-ARFIMA models. The other (daily) series would be modeled as RLS-ARMA models with measurement errors except in the case of the Forex market of Brazil where there is no evidence of measurement errors. Another possibility is to accept the small magnitudes of the estimates of the fractional parameter as evidence of genuine long memory and, in that case, a larger group of series can be modeled as RLS-ARFIMA models. The forecasts are evaluated from two perspectives: one using 10% of the Model Confidence Set of Hansen, Lunde, and Nason (2011) and the other using a recent statistic proposed by Knüppel (2015) to evaluate density forecasts. The results favor the RLS-ARMA and RLS-ARFIMA models although we found some differences between the two approaches for the cases of Brazil and Mexico (stocks) and Argentina (Forex). Finally, forecasts are used to calculate the VaR at 1%, 5% and 10%. The results support broadly the RLS-ARFIMA models with one or two exceptions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Wildlife Services National Rabies Management Program has conducted cooperative oral rabies vaccination (ORV) programs since 1997. Understanding the eco-epidemiology of raccoon (Procyon lotor) variant rabies (raccoon rabies) is critical to successful management. Pine (Pinus spp.)-dominated landscapes generally support low relative raccoon densities that may inhibit rabies spread. However, confounding landscape features, such as wetlands and human development, represent potentially elevated risk corridors for rabies spread, possibly imperiling enhanced rabies surveillance and ORV planning. Raccoon habitat suitability in pine-dominated landscapes in Massachusetts, Florida, and Alabama was modeled by the maximum entropy (Maxent) procedure using raccoon presence, and landscape and environmental data. Replicated (n = 100/state) bootstrapped Maxent models based on raccoon sampling locations from 2012–2014 indicated that soil type was the most influential variable in Alabama (permutation importance PI = 38.3), which, based on its relation to landcover type and resource distribution and abundance, was unsurprising. Precipitation (PI = 46.9) and temperature (PI = 52.1) were the most important variables in Massachusetts and Florida, but these possibly spurious results require further investigation. The Alabama Maxent probability surface map was ingested into Circuitscape for conductance visualizations of potential areas of habitat connectivity. Incorporating these and future results into raccoon rabies containment and elimination strategies could result in significant cost-savings for rabies management here and elsewhere. © 2017 by the authors.","Variables taking value in (0, 1), such as rates or proportions, are frequently analyzed by researchers, for instance, political and social data, as well as the Human Development Index (HDI). However, sometimes this type of data cannot be modeled adequately using a unique distribution. In this case, we can use a mixture of distributions, which is a powerful and flexible probabilistic tool. This manuscript deals with a mixture of simplex distributions to model proportional data. A fully Bayesian approach is proposed for inference which includes a reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure. The usefulness of the proposed approach is confirmed by using of the simulated mixture data from several different scenarios and by using the methodology to analyze municipal HDI data of cities (or towns) in the Northeast region and São Paulo state in Brazil. The analysis shows that among the cities in the Northeast, some appear to have a similar HDI to other cities in São Paulo state. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","The chub mackerel, Scomber japonicus supports an important fshery in the Southeast Pacifc, however, its population genetics is currently unknown. In the present study, we examined the genetic structure, the gene flow and the historical demography of this species in the Northern Humboldt Current System. Samples were collected during summer of years 2013-2014 from three fshing points (Paita, Ventanilla and Ilo), covering 12 degrees of latitude along the coast of Peru. A 532 bp segment of the mitochondrial control region was sequenced in 72 individuals, which allowed us to detect a total of 29 polymorphic sites, 35 haplotypes, moderate-to-high levels of haplotype diversity (0.793-0.969) and very low levels of nucleotide diversity (0.004-0.008). Gene flow analysis showed high levels of connectivity among populations in the sampling areas. Analysis of molecular variance (·ST = 0.00868, P = 0.1837), population pairwise ·ST comparisons and genetic diflerentiation tests confrmed the lack of genetic structuring among the three localities. These analyses suggest that sampling sites analyzed can be considered as a single gene pool. Migratory behavior, the high dispersal potential of early stages and the lack of oceanographic barriers may explain its genetic homogeneity along the Peruvian sea. Historical demography was also examined. Neutrality tests, mismatch distribution and Bayesian skyline plot suggested a population expansion scenario that took place during the Late Pleistocene. This study provides novel information on population genetics of the chub mackerel in the Southeast Pacifc. © Los autores.","The monophyletic Morpho sulkowskyi butterfly group, endemic of Andean cloud forests, was studied to test the respective contributions of Mio-Pliocene intense uplift period and Pleistocene glacial cycles on Andean biodiversity. We sampled nine taxa covering the whole geographical range of the group. Two mitochondrial and two nuclear genes were analysed using a Bayesian method. We established a dated phylogeny of the group using a relaxed clock method and a wide-outgroup approach. To discriminate between two hypotheses, we used a biogeographical probabilistic method. Results suggest that the ancestor of the M. sulkowskyi group originated during the Middle–Late Miocene uplift of the Eastern Cordillera in northern Peru. Biogeographical inference suggests that the M. sulkowskyi and Morpho lympharis clades diverged in the northern Peruvian Andes. The subsequent divergences, from the Late Miocene to the Late Pliocene, should have resulted from a dispersal towards the Northern Andes (M. sulkowskyi clade), after the closure of the West Andean Portal separating the Central and Northern Andes, and a southwards dispersal along the Peruvian and Bolivian Eastern Cordilleras (M. lympharis clade). Only a few divergences occurred at the very end of the Pliocene or during the Pleistocene, a period when the more recent uplifts interfered with Pleistocene glacial cycles. © 2016 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences","Polylepis woodlands, the dominant high-elevation woodland species of the Andes of South America, are an increasingly important focus of conservation and restoration efforts as a buffer to the regional effects of climate change. However, the natural extent of these woodlands before the arrival of human populations is still debated. One significant approach to this question is an assessment of the change in woodland extent from a hypothetical peak at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present where distributions have been altered by both Holocene climate oscillations and anthropogenic pressures of pre-Colombian and modern communities. LGM and present distributions for 21 Polylepis species were modeled using Maxent with environmental data obtained from the WorldClim database. Overall, potential woodland extent is 36% smaller today than at LGM, however a few species have experienced a projected increase in potential range of 180%. This has occurred at the interface of the southern Amazonian Basin with the Altiplano where Polylepis species richness is highest. Bioclimatically stable areas for each species averaged 20 ± 4% of the modeled range and mostly occurred in disjunct pockets from central Peru to northern Argentina and Chile. © 2017 by the authors.","The South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) is widely distributed along the southern Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America with a history of significant commercial exploitation. We aimed to evaluate the population genetic structure and the evolutionary history of South American sea lion along its distribution by analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and 10 nuclear microsatellites loci. We analyzed 147 sequences of mtDNA control region and genotyped 111 individuals of South American sea lion for 10 microsatellite loci, representing six populations (Peru, Northern Chile, Southern Chile, Uruguay (Brazil), Argentina and Falkland (Malvinas) Islands) and covering the entire distribution of the species. The mtDNA phylogeny shows that haplotypes from the two oceans comprise two very divergent clades as observed in previous studies, suggesting a long period (>1 million years) of low inter-oceanic female gene flow. Bayesian analysis of bi-parental genetic diversity supports significant (but less pronounced than mitochondrial) genetic structure between Pacific and Atlantic populations, although also suggested some inter-oceanic gene flow mediated by males. Higher male migration rates were found in the intra-oceanic population comparisons, supporting very high female philopatry in the species. Demographic analyses showed that populations from both oceans went through a large population expansion ∼10,000 years ago, suggesting a very similar influence of historical environmental factors, such as the last glacial cycle, on both regions. Our results support the proposition that the Pacific and Atlantic populations of the South American sea lion should be considered distinct evolutionarily significant units, with at least two managements units in each ocean. © 2017 Oliveira et al.

However, the discrimination capabilities of these features for ABSC could be enhanced by accounting for the vocal production mechanisms of birds, and, in particular, the spectro-temporal structure of bird sounds. In this paper, a new front-end for ABSC is proposed that incorporates this specific information through the non-negative decomposition of bird sound spectrograms. It consists of the following two different stages: short-time feature extraction and temporal feature integration. In the first stage, which aims at providing a better spectral representation of bird sounds on a frame-by-frame basis, two methods are evaluated. In the first method, cepstral-like features (NMF_CC) are extracted by using a filter bank that is automatically learned by means of the application of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on bird audio spectrograms. In the second method, the features are directly derived from the activation coefficients of the spectrogram decomposition as performed through NMF (H_CC). The second stage summarizes the most relevant information contained in the short-time features by computing several statistical measures over long segments. The experiments show that the use of NMF_CC and H_CC in conjunction with temporal integration significantly improves the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based ABSC system with respect to conventional MFCC. © 2017 Ludeña-Choez et al.

The eight currently recognized species occur in the lowlands of South and Central America. Based on the largest taxon and character sampling to date, we analyze three mitochondrial and one nuclear gene using Bayesian methods to (1) infer the phylogeny of Polychrus under both concatenated-tree and speciestree methods; (2) identify lineages that could represent putative undescribed species; and (3) estimate divergence times. Our species tree places P. acutirostris as the sister taxon to all other species of Polychrus. While the phylogenetic position of P. gutturosus and P. peruvianus is poorly resolved, P. marmoratus and P. femoralis are strongly supported as sister to P. liogaster and P. jacquelinae, respectively. Recognition of P. auduboni and P. marmoratus sensu stricto as distinct species indicates that the populations of \"P. marmoratus\" from the Amazon and the Atlantic coast in Brazil represent separate species. Similarly, populations of P. femoralis from the Tumbes region might belong to a cryptic undescribed species. Relative divergence times and published age estimates suggest that the orogeny of the Andes did not play a significant role in the early evolution of Polychrus. © 2017 Torres-Carvajal et al.

Interestingly, this mechanism is necessary for the viability of some tumor cells. Unfortunately, its molecular underpinnings are not yet completely understood. Objective: Here, we combine carefully designed non-targeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics experiments with a bioinformatics approach to characterize the ALT positive phenotype observed in yeast at the metabolomics level. Methods: We profiled the metabolome using mass spectrometry in yeast strains that have lost telomerase expression, as well as that in pre-senescence and the rescued states. To dissect unwanted technical variation from biologically relevant variation between these states, we used a two-step normalization strategy, i.e., first, an empirical Bayesian framework; and next, we corrected for second-order technical effects. Results: Our results show that ALT-positive yeast strains present two different types of metabolic responses to the genetically-induced telomerase dysfunction: (i) systemic and (ii) specific. The key-difference between these responses is that the systemic response lasts even after the yeast strains have been genetically rescued, while the specific response does not. Interestingly, these metabolic changes can be associated with generic stress responses (e.g., DNA damage) as well as specific responses like accelerated aging of early telomerase-inactivation. Conclusions: A mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach reveals two distinct types of metabolomics response to telomerase dysfunction in yeast. By identifying these changes in protein (e.g., ARG7, and ARG1), and metabolite (e.g., dATP, and dDTP) amounts, we complement the available information on ALT at the genome-wide level. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Objective To compare the accuracy of Demirjian's stages (DS) and Cameriere's third molar maturity index cut-off value (I3M < 0.08) to estimate the age of majority on panoramic radiographs (OPTs) from the dental clinic of the Scientific University of the South (UCSUR), Lima, Peru. Methods An observational cross-sectional study was conducted on the sample of 208 digital panoramic radiographs of patients aged 14–22 years examined during 2015 in UCSUR. The left lower third molars were analyzed using Adobe Photoshop® CS6. An effectiveness of specific DS and I3M < 0.08 was evaluated by using accurate classification, sensitivity, specificity, positive (LR+) and negative (LR−) likelihood ratios and Bayes post-test probability (p). Results Only G and H stages were practical for classify adults and minors in the tested sample, while I3M < 0.08 showed the best performance in both sexes. For I3M < 0.08, the accurate classification, sensitivity and specificity were 0.96, 0.96, 0.96 and 0.90, 0.84 and 0.95 in males and females, respectively. Values of LR+, LR− and p were 24.96, 0.04, 0.97 and 15.68, 0.17, 0.95 in males and females, respectively. Conclusion The specific cut-off value of third molar maturity index (I3M < 0.08) showed to be more accurate in discriminating adults and minors in Peruvian sample when a test with high sensitivity and specificity is required. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","A new genus of Anostomidae (Characiformes) is described to include ten valid extant species previously classified in Leporinus or Hypomasticus and distributed throughout most major river basins in South America: L. brinco, L. conirostris, L. elongatus, H. garmani, L. macrocephalus, L. muyscorum, L. obtusidens, L. piavussu, L. reinhardti, and L. trifasciatus. The monophyly of Megaleporinus is well-supported in a phylogenetic analysis based on two mitochondrial and three nuclear genes, as well as its sister group relationship to Abramites. Megaleporinus is diagnosed by having the exclusive combination of three unicuspid teeth on each premaxillary and dentary bone and a color pattern composed of one to four dark midlateral blotches. Additional distinguishing features and possible synapomorphies include a unique ZZ/ZW sex chromosome system confirmed for six congeners and a drumming apparatus wherein the first rib is elongated and associated with hypertrophied intercostal muscles, which was confirmed for three congeners as exclusive to mature males. Furthermore, our study identified at least four undescribed cryptic species, emphasizing the need for further taxonomic work and genetic analyses. A time-calibrated phylogenetic and biogeographical analysis of the new genus suggests that speciation in the proto-Amazon-Orinoco lineage was primarily driven by paleogeographic processes, such as the formation of the Orinoco and Tocantins basins. Dispersal and diversification of the genus in coastal basins draining the Eastern Brazilian Shield appears to have been facilitated by connections between paleo-basins during low sea level periods and headwater captures between coastal and inland watersheds. The present contribution demonstrates the importance of integrating data from morphology, DNA sequences and cytogenetics to advance the taxonomy and systematics of any complex species group. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","We use the approach of Qu and Perron (Econom J 16(3):309–339, 2013) for the modeling and inference of volatility of a set of commodity prices in the presence of random level shifts of unknown timing, magnitude and frequency. Our approach contributes to the study of commodities in several aspects. First, we test for the presence of a genuine long-memory process in the volatility of commodities. Second, we determine that the random level shifts are certainly the main source of variation in the commodity price volatility. Finally, we estimate the volatility and its components as latent variables, thereby making it possible to evaluate their level of correlation with macroeconomic variables in small open economies such as Latin-American countries where the dependence on commodity price volatility is high. We use six commodity series: agriculture, livestock, gold, oil, industrial metals and a general commodity index. All series cover the period from January 1983 until December 2013 in daily frequency. The results show that although the occurrence of a level shift is rare, (about once every 1.5 or 1.8 years), this component clearly contributes most to the variation in the volatility. Furthermore, isolating the level shift component from the overall volatility indicates a strong relationship of this component with a set of business cycle indicators of several Latin American countries. © 2016, Kiel Institute.","Bounded response variables are common in many applications where the responses are percentages, proportions, or rates. New regression models have been proposed recently to model the relationship among one or more covariates and the conditional mean of a response variable based on the beta distribution or a mixture of beta distributions. However, when we are interested in knowing how covariates impact different levels of the response variable, quantile regression models play an important role. A new quantile parametric mixed regression model for bounded response variables is presented by considering the distribution introduced by [27]. A Bayesian approach is adopted for inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Model comparison criteria are also discussed. The inferential methods can be easily programmed and then easily used for data modeling. Results from a simulation study are reported showing the good performance of the proposed inferential methods. Furthermore, results from data analyses using regression models with fixed and mixed effects are given. Specifically, we show that the quantile parametric model proposed here is an alternative and complementary modeling tool for bounded response variables such as the poverty index in Brazilian municipalities, which is linked to the Gini coefficient and the human development index.","In binary regression, symmetric links such as logit and probit are usually considered as standard. However, in the presence of unbalancing of ones and zeros, these links can be inappropriate and inflexible to fit the skewness in the response curve and likely to lead to misspecification. This is the case of covering some type of insurance, where it can be observed that the probability of a given binary response variable approaches zero at different rates than it approaches one. Furthermore, when usual links are considered, there is not a skewness parameter associated with the distribution chosen that, regardless of the linear predictor, is easily interpreted. In order to overcome such problems, a proposal for the construction of a set of new skew links is developed in this paper, where some of their properties are discussed. In this context, power links and their reversal versions are presented. A Bayesian inference approach using MCMC is developed for the presented models. The methodology is illustrated considering a sample of motor insurance policyholders selected randomly by gender. Results suggest that the proposed link functions are more appropriate than other alternative link functions commonly used in the literature. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Here, we contrast host and virus genetic signatures to resolve the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying geographic expansions of vampire bat rabies virus (VBRV) in Peru. Phylogenetic analysis revealed recent viral spread between populations that, according to extreme geographic structure in maternally inherited host mitochondrial DNA, appeared completely isolated. In contrast, greater population connectivity in biparentally inherited nuclear microsatellites explained the historical limits of invasions, suggesting that dispersing male bats spread VBRV between genetically isolated female populations. Host nuclear DNA further indicated unanticipated gene flow through the Andes mountains connecting the VBRV-free Pacific coast to the VBRV-endemic Amazon rainforest. By combining Bayesian phylogeography with landscape resistance models, we projected invasion routes through northern Peru that were validated by real-time livestock rabies mortality data. The first outbreaks of VBRV on the Pacific coast of South America could occur by June 2020, which would have serious implications for agriculture, wildlife conservation, and human health. Our results show that combining host and pathogen genetic data can identify sex biases in pathogen spatial spread, which may be a widespread but underappreciated phenomenon, and demonstrate that genetic forecasting can aid preparedness for impending viral invasions.","The electricity consumption behavior in Brazil has been extensively investigated over the years due to financial and social problems. In this context, it is important to simulate the energy prices of the energy efficiency auctions in the Brazilian regulated environment.

On one hand, this proposal allow us to tackle the \"cold start\" problem because it relies on a content-based approach. On the other hand, it is valuable for handling high uncertainty since it solely depends on available items and ratings given by users. Thus, there is no dependency on the number of items and users. In addition, it is highly scalable because user preferences get richer as items get ranked. © 2015 IEEE.","The Andean bear (Tremarctos ornatus) is a vulnerable species, his habitat is gradually fragmented by the expansion of human activities. In Peru, the Marañón dry forest, an ecoregion with little biological and ecological research, is the habitat of the species. Unfortunately, at the present time, it is being affected by agriculture, livestock and road construction, and soon will be threatened by the implementation of large scale economic activities, such as hydroelectric stations. In order to identify priority sectors for research and conservation of the Andean bear in the Marañón dry forest of Cajamarca and Amazonas regions, its habitat was modeled using MaxEnt algorithm. Sixty records of its presence as well as 6 environmental and climatic variables were used. Considering a total extension of 6,501.2 km2 of Marañón dry forest, the suitable existing habitat for the Andean bear would be only 480.7 km2 (7.4%) and the marginal existing habitat, 2,418.5 km2 (37.2%). Three priority sectors for research and conservation were identified which also present connectivity to montane forests and paramos inside protected areas: Cutervo National Park, Huangamarca Municipal Conservation Area (Cajamarca) and Private Conservation Areas, Huiquilla and Huaylla Belén-Colcamar (Amazonas). © 2016 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Instituto de Biología.","Monophyly of the genus Leporinus (Characiformes: Anostomidae) was tested by sequencing and analysing a total of 4732 bp, including two mitochondrial [cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) and cytochrome b (Cytb)] and three nuclear [myosin heavy chain 6 cardiac muscle alpha (Myh6), recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1) and recombination activating gene 2 (RAG2)] loci for 22 species of Leporinus, or c. 25% of all described species in the genus. Phylogenetic tree analyses (maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian species tree) indicate Leporinus to be paraphyletic, with monophyly being rejected by both Kishino-Hasegawa and Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests. The sequenced species of Leporinus are distributed across five clades that are interleaved among other anostomid genera. Several taxonomic changes are suggested as being necessary to restore monophyly for the group. The clade containing the type species, Leporinus fasciatus, should be considered Leporinus sensu stricto and at least three new genera should be described for other species currently considered part of Leporinus. © 2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.","While divergent ecological adaptation can drive speciation, understanding the factors that facilitate or constrain this process remains a major goal in speciation research. Here, we study two mimetic transition zones in the poison frog Ranitomeya imitator, a species that has undergone a Müllerian mimetic radiation to establish four morphs in Peru. We find that mimetic morphs are strongly phenotypically differentiated, producing geographic clines with varying widths. However, distinct morphs show little neutral genetic divergence, and landscape genetic analyses implicate isolation by distance as the primary determinant of among-population genetic differentiation. Mate choice experiments suggest random mating at the transition zones, although certain allopatric populations show a preference for their own morph. We present evidence that this preference may be mediated by color pattern specifically. These results contrast with an earlier study of a third transition zone, in which a mimetic shift was associated with reproductive isolation. Overall, our results suggest that the three known mimetic transition zones in R. imitator reflect a speciation continuum, which we have characterized at the geographic, phenotypic, behavioral, and genetic levels. We discuss possible explanations for variable progress toward speciation, suggesting that multifarious selection on both mimetic color pattern and body size may be responsible for generating reproductive isolation. © 2015 by The University of Chicago.

Despite considerable efforts for its control, vivax malaria remains a major health problem in Peru. In this study, we have explored the population genetics of Plasmodium vivax isolates from Iquitos, the main city in the Peruvian Amazon, and 25 neighbouring peri-urban as well as rural villages along the Iquitos-Nauta Road. Methodology/ Results: From April to December 2008, 292 P. vivax isolates were collected and successfully genotyped using 14 neutral microsatellites. Analysis of the molecular data revealed a similar proportion of monoclonal and polyclonal infections in urban areas, while in rural areas monoclonal infections were predominant (p = 0.002). Multiplicity of infection was higher in urban (MOI = 1.5–2) compared to rural areas (MOI = 1) (p = 0.003). The level of genetic diversity was similar in all areas (He = 0.66–0.76, p = 0.32) though genetic differentiation between areas was substantial (PHIPT = 0.17, p<0.0001). Principal coordinate analysis showed a marked differentiation between parasites from urban and rural areas. Linkage disequilibrium was detected in all the areas ((Formula presented.) = 0.08–0.49, for all p<0.0001). Gene flow among the areas was stablished through Bayesian analysis of migration models. Recent bottleneck events were detected in 4 areas and a recent parasite expansion in one of the isolated areas. In total, 87 unique haplotypes grouped in 2 or 3 genetic clusters described a sub-structured parasite population. Conclusion/Significance: Our study shows a sub-structured parasite population with clonal propagation, with most of its components recently affected by bottleneck events. Iquitos city is the main source of parasite spreading for all the peripheral study areas. The routes of transmission and gene flow and the reduction of the parasite population described are important from the public health perspective as well for the formulation of future control policies. © 2016 Delgado-Ratto et al.","Background: Positive mental health (PMH) is much more than the absence of mental illnesses. For example, PMH explains that to be happy or resilient can drive us to live a full life, giving us a perception of well-being and robustness against everyday problems. Moreover, PMH can help people to avoid risky behaviours like tobacco consumption (TC). Our hypothesis was that PMH is negatively associated with TC, and this association differs across rural, urban and migrant populations. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using the PERU MIGRANT Study's dataset, including rural population from the Peruvian highlands (n = 201), urban population from the capital city Lima (n = 199) and migrants who were born in highlands but had to migrated because of terrorism (n = 589). We used an adapted version of the 12-item Global Health Questionnaire to measure PMH. The outcome was TC, measured as lifetime and recent TC. Log-Poisson robust regression, performed with a Maximum Likelihood method, was used to estimate crude prevalence ratios (PR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95%CI), adjusted by sex, age, family income and education which were the confounders. The modelling procedure included the use of LR Test, Akaike information criteria (AIC) and Bayesian information criteria (BIC). Results: Cumulative occurrence of tobacco use (lifetime TC) was 61.7 % in the rural group, 78 % in the urban group and 76.2 % in rural-to-urban migrants. Recent TC was 35.3 % in the rural group, 30.7 % in the urban group and 20.5 % in rural-to-urban migrants. After adjusting for confounders, there was evidence of a negative association between PMH and lifetime TC in the rural group (PR = 0.93; 95%CI: 0.87-0.99), and a positive association between PMH and recent TC in migrants (PR = 1.1; 95%CI: 1.0-1.3). Conclusions: PMH was negatively associated with TC in rural participants only. Urbans exhibited just a similar trend, while migrants exhibited the opposite one. This evidence represents the first step in the route of knowing the potential of PMH for fighting against TC. For rural populations, this study supplies new information that could support decisions about prevention programmes and psychotherapy for smoking cessation. However, more research in the topic is needed. © 2016 Bazo-Alvarez et al.","A phylogenetic analysis of the scorpion genus Brachistosternus Pocock, 1893 (Bothriuridae Simon, 1880) is presented, based on a dataset including 41 of the 43 described species and five outgroups, 116 morphological characters and more than 4150 base-pairs of DNA sequence from the nuclear 18S rDNA and 28S rDNA gene loci, and the mitochondrial 12S rDNA, 16S rDNA, and Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit I gene loci. Analyses conducted using parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference were largely congruent with high support for most clades. The results confirmed the monophyly of Brachistosternus, the nominal subgenus, and subgenus Ministernus Francke, 1985, as in previous analyses based only on morphology, but differed in several other respects. Species from the plains of the Atacama Desert diverged basally whereas the high altitude Andean species radiated from a more derived ancestor, presumably as a consequence of Andean uplift and associated changes in climate. Species limits were assessed among species that contain intraspecific variation (e.g., different morphs), are difficult to separate morphologically, and/or exhibit widespread or disjunct distributions. The extent of convergence in morphological adaptation to life on sandy substrata (psammophily) and the complexity of the male genitalia, or hemispermatophores, was investigated. Psammophily evolved on at least four independent occasions. The lobe regions of the hemispermatophore increased in complexity on three independent occasions, and decreased in complexity on another three independent occasions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Among Neotropical lizards, the geographically widespread gymnophthalmid Cercosaura as currently defined includes lowland and highland taxa from Panama to Argentina, with some species occurring in the northern Andes. In this study we analyze three mitochondrial (12S, 16S, ND4) and one nuclear (c-mos) gene using Bayesian methods to clarify the phylogenetic relationships among most species of Cercosaura based on a well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis that also includes a large sample of other taxa within Cercosaurini. The phylogenetic tree obtained in this paper shows that Cercosaura as currently defined is not monophyletic. Two species from the northern Andes (C. dicra and C. vertebralis) are nested within Pholidobolus, which has been formerly recognized as a major radiation along the Andes of Ecuador and Colombia. Therefore, Cercosaura has probably not diversified in the northern Andes, although the phylogenetic position of C. hypnoides from the Andes of Colombia remains unknown. Tree topology and genetic distances support both recognition of C. ocellata bassleri as a distinct species, C. bassleri, and recognition of C. argula and C. oshaughnessyi as two different species. In the interest of promoting clarity and precision regarding the names of clades of gymnophthalmid lizards, we propose a phylogenetic definition of Cercosaura. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","The Laemolyta genus is a monophyletic group with five valid species. Phylogenetic relationships among the species of this genus are unknown. We analyzed four nominal Laemolyta species. The COI gene for all individuals was amplified and the genetic distances were estimated. We performed genetic distance analyses to determine the different MOTUs. Two mitochondrial (COI and CytB) and three nuclear (Myh6, RAG1 and RAG2) markers were amplified for one individual of each identified MOTU. Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood were conducted using concatenate alignment. In addition, multilocus Bayesian species tree was carried out. By using DNA barcode, we identified six different MOTUs. The COI inter-MOTU distances ranged from 0.92% to 5.76%. The normalized mean intra-MOTU distance was 0.13%. The DNA barcode was useful to diagnose all species. Two clades showing distinct color patterns were recovered in all molecular phylogenetic trees. Clade A joined fishes with no vertical bars (L. garmani, L. taeniata 1 and L. taeniata 2) and clade B, fishes with vertical dark bars (L. fernandezi Araguaia, L. fernandezi Xingu, and L. proxima). The results were able to identify the cryptic biodiversity within the group and obtained the most complete Laemolyta phylogeny. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","The standard methods of diagnosing disease based on antibody microtiter plates are quite crude. Few methods create a rigorous underlying model for the antibody levels of populations consisting of a mixture of positive and negative subjects, and fewer make full use of the entirety of the available data for diagnoses. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that provides a systematic way of pooling data across different plates, and accounts for the subtle sources of variations that occur in the optical densities of typical microtiter data. In addition to our Bayesian method having good frequentist properties, we find that our method outperforms one of the standard crude approaches (the “3 SD Rule”) under reasonable assumptions, and provides more accurate disease diagnoses in terms of both sensitivity and specificity. © 2014, International Chinese Statistical Association.","The rubbernose-pleco genus Chaetostoma comprises 47 currently valid and many undescribed species distributed along Atlantic and Pacific slopes of the Andes Mountains from Panama to southern Peru, the Coastal Mountains of Venezuela, and drainages of the Guiana and Brazilian shields. We present a five-locus molecular phylogeny for 21 described and six undescribed species of Chaetostoma spanning the geographic range of the genus. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses found Chaetostoma to be well supported as monophyletic and sister to a clade of central and northern Andean genera that have also been hypothesized to be closely related based on morphology (i.e., Andeancistrus, Cordylancistrus, Dolichancistrus, Leptoancistrus, and Transancistrus). Species of Chaetostoma were divided into a trichotomy consisting of: a Pacific Coast, Central American, Magdalena Basin, Lake Valencia, and Guiana Shield clade a western Orinoco, Lake Maracaibo, and Lake Valencia clade and a widespread upper Amazon/Orinoco clade inclusive of a single species on the Brazilian Shield. We also conducted a systematic review of species from the central Andes of northern Peru and Ecuador. Based on our phylogenetic results and direct examination of historical and recently collected type and non-type material, we describe two new species of Chaetostoma (C. bifurcum, from the Pacific Coast, and C. trimaculineum, from the Atlantic Slope), redescribe four species (C. breve, C. carrioni, C. dermorhynchum, and C. microps, all from the Atlantic Slope), transfer four species from Chaetostoma to Ancistrus and find two species to be junior synonyms. © 2015 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.","Niche modelling software can be used to assess the probability of detecting a population of a plant species at a certain location. In this study, we used the distribution of the wild relatives of lettuce (Lactuca spp.) to investigate the applicability of Maxent species distribution models for collecting missions. Geographic origin data of genebank and herbarium specimens and climatic data of the origin locations were used as input. For Lactuca saligna, we varied the input data by omitting the specimens from different parts of the known distribution area to assess the robustness of the predicted distributions. Furthermore, we examined the accuracy of the modelling by comparing the predicted probabilities of population presence against recent expedition data for the endemic Lactuca georgica and the cosmopolitan Lactuca serriola. We found Maxent to be quite robust in its predictions, although its usefulness was higher for endemic taxa than for more widespread species. The exclusion of occurrence data from the perceived range margins of the species can result in important information about local adaptation to distinct climatic conditions. We discuss the potential for enhanced use of Maxent in germplasm collecting planning. © NIAB 2014.","We studied populations of Stenocereus pruinosus throughout Mexico, a species important for its edible fruit. The Tehuacán Valley is setting of ancient and the currently most active management of S. pruinosus; we hypothesized Tehuacán as the original area of domestication of S. pruinosus and expected to find there its highest genetic variation and original source of genes of cultivated plants. Through nuclear microsatellite loci we studied spatial distribution of genetic variation and population differentiation. We sampled wild and managed populations of the Central-western (Tehuacán, Central Valleys and Tehuantepec, Oaxaca), north-eastern (Huasteca) and south-eastern (Chiapas) regions. Differences among regions and populations were compared through homogeneity and exact test for FIS , AMOVA, Bayesian analysis, and genetic barriers. A niche analysis allowed corroborating taxonomic identity of populations. The highest genetic diversity was in Tehuantepec (HE = 0.841), decreasing towards the extremes of distribution (HE = 0.242 in Huasteca, HE = 0.254 in Chiapas). Genetic structure is significantly high among populations and regional groups, differentiating one group formed by northern and southern populations and other formed by populations of the Central-western region. Differences among groups suggested that populations from Huasteca could be species different to S. pruinosus, but the niche analysis did not support such hypothesis. Populations from Tehuantepec were different but genetically interconnected with those of Tehuacán. Tehuantepec is the main reservoir of genetic diversity of wild populations of S. pruinosus, but Tehuacán is the principal current area of domestication of S. pruinosus and probably where its domestication originated. Conclusions would be stronger by analyzing DNAc lineages. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Aim: The subduction of the Nazca Plate and the eastward propagation of the Andean orogenic wedge in western Amazonia caused the formation of arches or ridges that have influenced the modern configuration of the upper Amazon drainage and the diversification of biota. We used a lineage of 15 palm species (Astrocaryum sect. Huicungo, Arecaceae) to test two biogeographical hypotheses for lowland plants: (1) that vicariance resulted from tectonically mediated geographical barriers (population contraction), and (2) that recurrent dispersal events (population expansion) produced geographical isolation and subsequent speciation. Location: Rain forests of South America. Methods: A total of 78 palm individuals were collected in the field, from which five chloroplast and two nuclear DNA fragments were sequenced. We reconstructed a Bayesian dated phylogeny and inferred the demographic history. We used a Bayesian phylogeographical spatial diffusion approach to propose a model of colonization. Results: We found a phylogeographical break at c. 5° S between two main clades with crown ages of c. 6.7 and 7.3 Ma located in the Fitzcarrald Arch (FA) and the subsiding northern Amazonian foreland basin (NAFB), respectively. These diversification times were close to the emergence of the FA in the late Miocene, and the coeval development of the transcontinental modern drainage and sedimentation plain of the NAFB. As expected for the recurrent-dispersal hypothesis, lineage delimitations were spatially inconsistent with the location of rivers or ridges, and we found some evidence of past ancestral population expansion supported particularly by the chloroplast sequences. Main conclusions: Our results support the biogeographical scenario whereby recurrent dispersal into western Amazonia produced spatial isolation of populations, followed by speciation within two areas of contrasting geological activity: tectonic uplift in the FA versus subsidence in the NAFB. We did not test and cannot rule out ecological speciation within western Amazonia or at finer spatial scales. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Over the last two decades, a large number of camera trap surveys have been carried out around the world and camera traps have been proposed as an ideal tool for inventorying and monitoring medium to large-sized terrestrial vertebrates. However, few studies have analysed camera trap data at the community level. We developed a multi-session multi-species occupancy model that allows us to obtain estimates for species richness and occupancy combining data from multiple camera trap surveys (sessions). By estimating species presence at the session-level and modelling detection probability and occupancy for each species and sessions as nested random effects, we could improve parameter estimates for each session, especially for species with sparse data. We developed two variants of our model: one was a binary latent states model while the other used a Royle-Nichols formulation for the relationship between detection probability and abundance. We applied both models to data from eight camera trap surveys from south-eastern Peru including six study sites, 263 camera stations and 17 423 camera days. Sites covered protected areas, a logging concession and Brazil nut concessions. We included habitat (terra firme vs. floodplain) as a covariate for occupancy and trail vs. off-trail as a covariate for detection. Among-camera heterogeneity was a serious problem for our data and the Royle-Nichols variant of our model had a much better fit than the binary-state variant. Both models resulted in similar species richness estimates showing that most of the sites contained intact large mammal communities. Detection probabilities and occupancy values were more variable across species than across sessions within species. Three species showed a habitat preference and four species showed preference or avoidance of trails. Synthesis and applications. Our multi-session multi-species occupancy model provides improved estimates for species richness and occupancy for a large data set. Our model is ideally suited for integrating large numbers of camera trap data sets to investigate regional and/or temporal patterns in the distribution and composition of mammal communities in relation to natural or anthropogenic factors or to monitor mammal communities over time. © 2015 The Authors.","Understanding the spatiotemporal behavior of fishermen at the fleet scale is key for defining effective strategies for fisheries management. Here we classify the spatial patterns exhibited by fishing trip trajectories in the world's largest monospecific fishery, the Peruvian anchovy fishery. Our goal is to identify spatial strategies and their possible changes over 2000-2009. The data comprise more than 350,000 fishing trips, recorded using a vessel monitoring system. On-board observers monitored a small fraction of those trips (>2000), providing data for inferring the type of activity (fishing, searching, and cruising) from the position records, for use in a state-space model. Each fishing trip was characterized by its duration, maximum distance to the coast, geographical extension, and time spent fishing, searching and cruising. Using clustering techniques, we identified four types of fishing trips, associated with differences in management among regions, fleet segments, and skippers' behavior. The methodology could be used to investigate fishing spatial strategies using VMS trajectories in other fisheries. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","The Northern Humboldt Current System (NHCS) is the world's most productive ecosystem in terms of fish. In particular, the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens) is the major prey of the main top predators, like seabirds, fish, humans, and other mammals. In this context, it is important to understand the dynamics of the anchovy distribution to preserve it as well as to exploit its economic capacities. Using the data collected by the \"Instituto del Mar del Perú\" (IMARPE) during a scientific survey in 2005, we present a statistical analysis that has as main goals: (i) to adapt to the characteristics of the sampled data, such as spatial dependence, high proportions of zeros and big size of samples; (ii) to provide important insights on the dynamics of the anchovy population; and (iii) to propose a model for estimation and prediction of anchovy biomass in the NHCS offshore from Perú. These data were analyzed in a Bayesian framework using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) method. Further, to select the best model and to study the predictive power of each model, we performed model comparisons and predictive checks, respectively. Finally, we carried out a Bayesian spatial influence diagnostic for the preferred model. © 2014, The International Biometric Society.","This study compares two nonparametric rainfall data merging methods-the mean bias correction and double-kernel smoothing-with two geostatistical methods-kriging with external drift and Bayesian combination-for optimizing the hydrometeorological performance of a satellite-based precipitation product over a mesoscale tropical Andean watershed in Peru. The analysis is conducted using 11 years of daily time series from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) research product (also TRMM 3B42) and 173 rain gauges from the national weather station network. The results are assessed using 1) a cross-validation procedure and 2) a catchment water balance analysis and hydrological modeling. It is found that the double-kernel smoothing method delivered the most consistent improvement over the original satellite product in both the cross-validation and hydrological evaluation. The mean bias correction also improved hydrological performance scores, particularly at the subbasin scale where the rain gauge density is higher. Given the spatial heterogeneity of the climate, the size of the modeled catchment, and the sparsity of data, it is concluded that nonparametric merging methods can perform as well as or better than more complex geostatistical methods, whose assumptions may not hold under the studied conditions. Based on these results, a systematic approach to the selection of a satellite-rain gauge data merging technique is proposed that is based on data characteristics. Finally, the underperformance of an ordinary kriging interpolation of the rain gauge data, compared to TMPA and other merged products, supports the use of satellite-based products over gridded rain gauge products that utilize sparse data for hydrological modeling at large scales. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.","Statistical modeling in political analysis is used recently to describe electoral behaviour of political party. In this chapter we propose aWeibull mixture model that describes the votes obtained by a political party in Brazilian presidential elections. We considered the votes obtained by the Workers’ Party in five presidential elections from 1994 to 2010. A Bayesian approach was considered and a random walk Metropolis algorithm within Gibbs sampling was implemented. Next, Bayes factor was considered to the choice of the number of components in the mixture. In addition the probability of obtain 50% of the votes in the first round was estimated. The results show that only few components are needed to describe the votes obtained in this election. Finally, we found that the probability of obtaining 50% of the votes in the first ballot is increasing along time.

The tribe currently includes seven genera: Aschersoniodoxa, Brayopsis, Dactylocardamum, Delpinophytum, Eudema, Onuris, and Xerodraba, and exhibits a wide morphological diversification in growth habit, inflorescences, and fruits. However, little is known about the phylogenetic relationships and evolution of the tribe. We present here a molecular phylogeny of representative sampling of all genera, utilizing sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal ITS region and chloroplast regions trnL-F, trnH-psbA, and rps16. Additionally, climatic niches of the tribe and its main lineages, along with the evolution of diagnostic morphological characters, were studied. All analyses confirmed the monophyly of Eudemeae, with the exception of Delpinophytum that was included with genera of the lineage I of Brassicaceae. Eudemeae is divided into two main lineages differentiated by their geographical distribution and climatic niche: the primarily north-central Andean lineage included Aschersoniodoxa, Brayopsis, Dactylocardamum, and Eudema, and the Patagonian and southern Andean lineage included Onuris and Xerodraba. Finally, ancestral-state reconstructions in the tribe generally reveal multiple and independent gains or losses of diagnostic morphological characters, such as growth form, inflorescence reduction, and fruit type. Relevant taxonomic implications stemming from the results are also discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","The Scarlet Ibis (Eudocimus ruber) and White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) are often classified as separate species, but differing scientific opinions exist regarding the taxonomic status of these birds, as they exhibit similar behavior and hybridize in nature. The present study provides genetic data to help clarify this taxonomic issue. DNA was extracted from 10 individuals of each taxon from the states of Florida, USA (White Ibis) and Amapá, Brazil (Scarlet Ibis). The sequences of three mitochondrial and four nuclear markers were obtained from all individuals. The Scarlet Ibis and White Ibis did not share any haplotypes in mitochondrial genes nor in one nuclear marker. Species delimitation using Bayesian analysis, the Knowles-Carstens method and the genealogical sorting index demonstrated the Scarlet Ibis and White Ibis to be two different lineages and revealed a strong signal of speciation despite the polyphyly found in three of the four nuclear markers.","Small pelagic fish aggregate within areas of suitable habitat to form patchy distributions with localized peaks in abundance. This presents challenges for geostatistical methods designed to investigate the processes underpinning the spatial distribution of stocks and simulate distributions for further analysis. In two-stage models, presence–absence is treated as separable and independent from the process explaining nonzero densities. This is appropriate where gaps in the distribution are attributable to one process and conditional abundance to another, but less so where patchiness is attributable primarily to the strong schooling tendencies of small pelagic fish within suitable habitat. We therefore developed a new modelling framework based on a truncated Gaussian random field (GRF) within a Bayesian framework. We evaluated this method using simulated test data and then applied it to acoustic survey data for Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens). We assessed the method’s performance in terms of posterior densities of spatial parameters, and the density distribution, spatial pattern, and overall spatial distribution of posterior predictions. We conclude that Bayesian posterior prediction based on a truncated GRF is effective at reproducing the patchiness of the observed spatial distribution of anchoveta. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada.

Considering previous knowledge about the system given by approximated linear state-space models, linear observers and linear controllers, training algorithms for the neuro-identification, state neuro-estimation and output feedback neuro-control were derived considering the dynamics of the nonlinear system. It was found that the integrated linear-neuro model can identify the dynamics of the system much more accurately than a purely linear model or a purely neuro model. It was also found that the state estimation and vibration isolation performance of the system with integrated linear-neuro output feedback control is better than the system with linear control or neuro-control. © 2014 TCCT, CAA.","There has been growing recognition of the importance of creating performance measurement tools for the economic, social and environmental management of micro and small enterprise (MSE).

At the end of the paper, methodological and managerial contributions are presented.","Micronutrient malnutrition is a global health problem. An improved understanding of the genetic variation of important micronutrient traits within a potato breeding population will help devise breeding strategies for the biofortification of this important food staple. The dataset consisted of 556 individuals from 17 full-sib diploid families grown in 2006 in Huanuco, Peru, and 1329 individuals from 32 full-sib families grown in 2009 in Ayacucho, Peru. Genetic parameters were estimated using univariate and multivariate individual Bayesian models for micronutrient tuber content including Fe and Zn. Genetic variance was additive and heritability estimates were moderate (0.36 to 0.57) and inflated if the common environment of full-sibs was not taken into account. Posterior modes of genetic correlation estimates between minerals, when analyzed on a dry-weight basis, were all positive (0.04 to 0.72) and between minerals and tuber dry matter were negative (-0.14 to-0.38). On a fresh-weight basis, genetic correlations between minerals and tuber dry matter were small but positive (0.05 to 0.18). The implications and challenges for selective breeding to enhance micronutrient content in potato tubers are discussed. © Crop Science Society of America.","Aim: To examine the phylogeography of Ficus insipida subsp. insipida in order to investigate patterns of spatial genetic structure across the Neotropics and within Amazonia. Location: Neotropics. Methods: Plastid DNA (trnH-psbA; 410 individuals from 54 populations) and nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS; 85 individuals from 27 populations) sequences were sampled from Mexico to Bolivia, representing the full extent of the taxon's distribution. Divergence of plastid lineages was dated using a Bayesian coalescent approach. Genetic diversity was assessed with indices of haplotype and nucleotide diversities, and genetic structure was examined using spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) and haplotype networks. Population expansion within Amazonia was tested using neutrality and mismatch distribution tests. Results: trnH-psbA sequences yielded 19 haplotypes restricted to either Mesoamerica or Amazonia; six haplotypes were found among ITS sequences. Diversification of the plastid DNA haplotypes began c. 14.6 Ma. Haplotype diversity for trnH-psbA was higher in Amazonia. Seven genetically differentiated SAMOVA groups were described for trnH-psbA, of which two were also supported by the presence of unique ITS sequences. Population expansion was suggested for both markers for the SAMOVA group that contains most Amazonian populations. Main conclusions: Our results show marked population genetic structure in F. insipida between Mesoamerica and Amazonia, implying that the Andes and seasonally dry areas of northern South America are eco-climatic barriers to its migration. This pattern is shared with other widespread pioneer species affiliated to wet habitats, indicating that the ecological characteristics of species may impact upon large-scale phylogeography. Ficus insipida also shows genetic structure in north-western Amazonia potentially related to pre-Pleistocene historical events. In contrast, evident population expansion elsewhere in Amazonia, in particular the presence of genetically uniform populations across the south-west, indicate recent colonization. Our findings are consistent with palaeoecological data that suggest recent post-glacial expansion of Amazonian forests in the south. © 2014 The Authors.

These link functions will be named power probit and reciprocal power probit due to the relation between them including the probit link as a special case. Also, the probit regressions are special cases of the models considered in this work. A Bayesian inference approach using MCMC is developed for real data suggesting that the link functions proposed here are more appropriate than other link functions used in the literature. In addition, simulation study show that the use of probit model will lead to biased estimate of the regression coefficient. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2014.","The Dorado or Plateado (Gilded catfish) Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii (Pimelodidae, Siluriformes) is a commercially valuable migratory catfish performing the largest migration in freshwaters: from the Amazonian headwaters in the Andean foothills (breeding area) to the Amazon estuary (nursery area). In spite of its importance to inform management and conservation efforts, the genetic variability of this species has only recently begun to be studied. The aim of the present work was to determine the population genetic structure of B. rousseauxii in two regions: the Upper Madera Basin (five locations in the Bolivian Amazon) and the Western Amazon Basin (one regional sample from the Uyucalí-Napo-Marañon-Amazon basin, Peru). Length polymorphism at nine microsatellite loci (284 individuals) was used to determine genetic variability and to identify the most probable panmictic units (using a Bayesian approach), after a significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed in the overall dataset (Western Amazon + Upper Madera). Bayesian analyses revealed at least three clusters in admixture in the five locations sampled in the Bolivian Amazon, whereas only two of these clusters were observed in the Western Amazon. Considering the migratory behaviour of B. rousseauxii, different life history strategies, including homing, are proposed to explain the cluster distribution. Our results are discussed in the light of the numerous threats to the species survival in the Madera basin, in particular dam and reservoir construction. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","We introduce new applications of the skew-probit IRT model by considering a flexible skew-normal distribution for the latent variables and by extending this model to include an additional random effect for modeling dependence between items within the same testlet. A Bayesian hierarchical structure is presented using a double data augmentation approach. This can be easily implemented in WinBUGS or SAS by considering MCMC algorithms. Several Bayesian model selection criteria, such as DIC, EAIC and EBIC, have been considered; in addition, we use posterior sum of squares of the latent residuals as a global discrepancy measure to model comparison. Two applications illustrate the methodology, one data set related to a mathematical test and another related to reading comprehension, both applied to Peruvian students. Results indicate better performance of the more flexible models proposed in this paper. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2014.","Tobit confirmatory factor analysis is particularly useful in analysis of multivariate data with censored information. Two methods for estimating multivariate Tobit confirmatory factor analysis models with covariates from a Bayesian and likelihood-based perspectives are proposed. In contrast with previous likelihood-based developments that consider Monte Carlo simulations for maximum likelihood estimation, an exact EM-type algorithm is proposed. Also, the estimation of the parameters via MCMC techniques by considering a hierarchical formulation of the model is explored. Bayesian case deletion influence diagnostics based on the q-divergence measure and model selection criteria is also developed and considered in the analysis of a real dataset related to the education assessment field. In addition, a simulation study is conducted to compare the performance of the proposed method with the traditional confirmatory factor analysis. The results show that both methods offer more precise inferences than the traditional confirmatory factor analysis, which ignores the information about the censoring threshold. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Opinions of experts who have worked with species of interest in the field can be a valuable and independent information source to validate EEM because of their first-hand experience with species occurrence and absence. However, their use in model validation is limited because of the subjectivity of their feedback. In this study, we present a method on the basis of cultural consensus theory to formalize expert model evaluations. Methods: We developed, for five tree species, distribution models with nine different variable combinations and Maxent EEM software. Species specialists validated the generated distribution maps through an online Google Earth interface with the scores from Invalid to Excellent. Experts were also asked about the commission and omission errors of the distribution models they evaluated. We weighted expert scores according to consensus theory. These values were used to obtain a final average expert score for each of the produced distribution models. The consensus-weighted expert scores were compared with un-weighted scores and correlated to four conventional model performance parameters after cross-validation with test data: Area Under Curve (AUC), maximum Kappa, commission error and omission error. Results: The median consensus-weighted expert score of all species-variable combinations was close to Fair. In general, experts that reached more consensus with peers were more positive about the EEM outcomes, compared to those that had more opposite judgements. Both consensus-weighted and un-weighted scores were significantly correlated to corresponding AUC, maximum Kappa and commission error values, but not to omission errors. More than half of the experts indicated that the distribution model they considered best included areas where the species is known to be absent. One third also indicated areas of species presence that were omitted by the model. Conclusions: Our results indicate that experts are fairly positive about EEM outcomes. This is encouraging, but EEM application for conservation actions remains limited according to them. Methods to formalize expert knowledge allow a wider use of this information in model validation and improvement, and they complement conventional validation methods of presence-only modelling. Online GIS and survey applications facilitate the consultation of experts. © 2013 International Association for Vegetation Science.","In this paper, we formulate a very flexible family of models which unifies most recent lifetime distributions. The main idea is to obtain a cumulative distribution function to transform the baseline distribution with an activation mechanism characterized by a latent threshold variable. The new family has a strong biological interpretation from the competitive risks point of view and the Box-Cox transformation provides an elegant manner to interpret the effect on the baseline distribution to obtain this alternative model. Several structural properties of the new model are investigated. A Bayesian analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure is developed to illustrate with a real data the usefulness of the proposed family. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Crop wild relatives possess important traits, therefore ex situ and in situ conservation efforts are essential to maintain sufficient options for crop improvement. Bolivia is a centre of wild relative diversity for several crops, among them potato, which is an important staple worldwide and the principal food crop in this country. Despite their relevance for plant breeding, limited knowledge exists about their in situ conservation status. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and distribution modelling with the software Maxent to better understand geographic patterns of endemic wild potato diversity in Bolivia. In combination with threat layers, we assessed the conservation status of all endemic species, 21 in total. We prioritised areas for in situ conservation by using complementary reserve selection and excluded 25% of the most-threatened collection sites because costs to implement conservation measures at those locations may be too high compared to other areas. Some 70% (15 of 21 species) has a preliminary vulnerable status or worse according to IUCN red list distribution criteria. Our results show that four of these species would require special conservation attention because they were only observed in <15 locations and are highly threatened by human accessibility, fires and livestock pressure. Although highest species richness occurs in south-central Bolivia, in the departments Santa Cruz and Chuquisaca, the first priority area for in situ conservation according to our reserve selection exercise is central Bolivia, Cochabamba; this area is less threatened than the potato wild relatives' hotspot in south-central Bolivia. Only seven of the 21 species were observed in protected areas. To improve coverage of potato wild relatives' distribution by protected areas, we recommend starting inventories in parks and reserves with high modelled diversity. Finally, to improve ex situ conservation, we targeted areas for germplasm collection of species with <5 accessions conserved in genebanks. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.","We studied the phylogeny of 22 accessions of Daucus and seven accessions in related genera, with DNA sequences from eight nuclear orthologs and one plastid (psbA/trnH) region. Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of the concatenated data matrix of 7,212 aligned nucleotides provided excellent bootstrap support for many clades. Concordant with prior molecular results Pseudorlaya pumila was firmly imbedded within Daucus, as was Margottia gummifera, a new finding. All accessions of D. capillifolius, D. carota, and D. sahariensis formed a 2n = 18 clade with all other species within the Daucus clade with chromosome numbers of = 20, 22, and 44 (D. glochidiatus). Sister to the D. carota clade was a clade containing Margottia gummifera and Pseudorlaya pumila, sister to these species was D. crinitus, sister to all the above was D. muricatus, and sister to all of the above was a clade containing the remaining Daucus species. Bayesian analyses of individual regions analyzed separately and averaged over multiple trees with *BEAST software (a coalescent approach), however, provided a phylogeny at variance with the concatenated approach, most notably in firmly imbedding Turgenia latifolia within Daucus. © 2013 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.","The majority of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detect Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), encoded by the pfhrp2 gene. Recently, P. falciparum isolates from Peru were found to lack pfhrp2 leading to false-negative RDT results. We hypothesized that pfhrp2-deleted parasites in Peru derived from a single genetic event. We evaluated the parasite population structure and pfhrp2 haplotype of samples collected between 1998 and 2005 using seven neutral and seven chromosome 8 microsatellite markers, respectively. Five distinct pfhrp2 haplotypes, corresponding to five neutral microsatellite-based clonal lineages, were detected in 1998-2001; pfhrp2 deletions occurred within four haplotypes. In 2003-2005, outcrossing among the parasite lineages resulted in eight population clusters that inherited the five pfhrp2 haplotypes seen previously and a new haplotype; pfhrp2 deletions occurred within four of these haplotypes. These findings indicate that the genetic origin of pfhrp2 deletion in Peru was not a single event, but likely occurred multiple times.","The increasing rate of biological invasions resulting from human transport or human-mediated changes to the environment has had devastating ecological and public health consequences. The kissing bug, Triatoma infestans, has dispersed through the Peruvian city of Arequipa. The biological invasion of this insect has resulted in a public health crisis, putting thousands of residents of this city at risk of infection by Trypanosoma cruzi and subsequent development of Chagas disease. Here, we show that populations of Tria. infestans in geographically distinct districts within and around this urban centre share a common recent evolutionary history although current gene flow is restricted even between proximal sites. The population structure among the Tria. infestans in different districts is not correlated with the geographical distance between districts. These data suggest that migration among the districts is mediated by factors beyond the short-range migratory capabilities of Tria. infestans and that human movement has played a significant role in the structuring of the Tria. infestans population in the region. Rapid urbanization across southern South America will continue to create suitable environments for Tria. infestans, and knowledge of its urban dispersal patterns may play a fundamental role in mitigating human disease risk. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","One major challenge in the emerging field of movement ecology is the inference of behavioural modes from movement patterns. This has been mainly addressed through Hidden Markov models (HMMs). We propose here to evaluate two sets of alternative and state-of-the-art modelling approaches. First, we consider hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs). They may better represent the behavioural dynamics of foragers since they explicitly model the duration of the behavioural modes. Second, we consider discriminative models which state the inference of behavioural modes as a classification issue, and may take better advantage of multivariate and non linear combinations of movement pattern descriptors. For this work, we use a dataset of >200 trips from human foragers, Peruvian fishermen targeting anchovy. Their movements were recorded through a Vessel Monitoring System (∼1 record per hour), while their behavioural modes (fishing, searching and cruising) were reported by on-board observers. We compare the efficiency of hidden Markov, hidden semi-Markov, and three discriminative models (random forests, artificial neural networks and support vector machines) for inferring the fishermen behavioural modes, using a cross-validation procedure. HSMMs show the highest accuracy (80%), significantly outperforming HMMs and discriminative models. Simulations show that data with higher temporal resolution, HSMMs reach nearly 100% of accuracy. Our results demonstrate to what extent the sequential nature of movement is critical for accurately inferring behavioural modes from a trajectory and we strongly recommend the use of HSMMs for such purpose. In addition, this work opens perspectives on the use of hybrid HSMM-discriminative models, where a discriminative setting for the observation process of HSMMs could greatly improve inference performance. © 2013 Joo et al.","Development of appropriate forest conservation and management measures for a given tree species includes the identification of distinct genetically homogeneous units across its overall distribution range, which depends on the availability of knowledge on genetic, morphological and adaptive variation. This has important implications for germplasm transfer within and between areas, for example in reforestation or restoration activities. Genetic zones are defined as genetically more or less homogeneous regions within which propagation material can be transferred with relative certainty not to cause changes at the genetic structure level. The main goal of this study was to define genetic zones for Nothofagus nervosa and Nothofagus obliqua within their Argentinean natural distribution range. A total of 823 individuals belonging to 24 populations (14 of N. nervosa and 10 of N. obliqua, μ=. 34. ±. 5) were genotyped by means of seven nuclear microsatellite markers. The geographic clustering encountered through the application of a Bayesian approach was analyzed in combination with additional information on diversity parameters, chloroplast DNA and isozymes. For assembling the maps showing the distribution of clusters, we averaged cluster membership values of trees in each grid cell. To visualize geographical patterns in nSRR richness and the distribution of different clusters of both species, we carried out grid-based spatial analyses using 30. s grid cells (~1. km at the equator) as the unit of analyses. We distinguished five genetic zones for N. nervosa and three for N. obliqua, consistent with the management history of the species, and displaying a certain level of geographic congruence. Higher allelic richness values were found in the surroundings of areas identified as potential glacial refugia, which suggest that the distribution pattern of allelic richness is closely associated with the glacial history of the species within the region. We expect this information to constitute a valuable tool for the identification of seed transfer zones, and to guide recruitment and plantation activities in the context of domestication programs of both species in Argentina. For assisted migration programs under progressive climate change the identification of these zones together with knowledge concerning hotspots at genetic diversity level should constitute an input for planning the activities. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Although there are over 1,150 bat species worldwide, the diversity of viruses harbored by bats has only recently come into focus as a result of expanded wildlife surveillance. Such surveys are of importance in determining the potential for novel viruses to emerge in humans, and for optimal management of bats and their habitats. To enhance our knowledge of the viral diversity present in bats, we initially surveyed 415 sera from African and Central American bats. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing revealed the presence of a highly diverse group of bat-derived viruses related to hepaciviruses and pegiviruses within the family Flaviridae. Subsequent PCR screening of 1,258 bat specimens collected worldwide indicated the presence of these viruses also in North America and Asia. A total of 83 bat-derived viruses were identified, representing an infection rate of nearly 5%. Evolutionary analyses revealed that all known hepaciviruses and pegiviruses, including those previously documented in humans and other primates, fall within the phylogenetic diversity of the bat-derived viruses described here. The prevalence, unprecedented viral biodiversity, phylogenetic divergence, and worldwide distribution of the bat-derived viruses suggest that bats are a major and ancient natural reservoir for both hepaciviruses and pegiviruses and provide insights into the evolutionary history of hepatitis C virus and the human GB viruses.","Extraction of protein-protein interactions from scientific papers is a relevant task in the biomedical field. Machine learning-based methods such as kernel-based represent the state-of-the-art in this task. Many efforts have focused on obtaining new types of kernels in order to employ syntactic information, such as parse trees, to extract interactions from sentences. These methods have reached the best performances on this task. Nevertheless, parse trees were not exploited by other machine learning-based methods such as Bayesian networks. The advantage of using Bayesian networks is that we can exploit the structure of the parse trees to learn the Bayesian network structure, i.e., the parse trees provide the random variables and also possible relations among them. Here we use syntactic relation as a causal dependence between variables. Hence, our proposed method learns a Bayesian network from parse trees. The evaluation was carried out over five protein-protein interaction benchmark corpora. Results show that our method is competitive in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","In this paper, we develop and estimate a dynamic stochastic, general-equilibrium New Keynesian model with partial dollarization. Bayesian techniques and Peruvian data are used to evaluate two forms of dollarization: currency substitution (CS) and price dollarization (PD). The empirical results are as follow: first, it is noted that the two forms of partial dollarization are important in explaining the significance of the Peruvian data. Second, models with both forms of dollarization dominate models without dollarization. Third, a counterfactual exercise shows that by eliminating both forms of partial dollarization, the response of both output and consumption to a monetary policy shock doubles, making the interest rate channel of monetary policy more effective. Fourth, based on the variance decomposition of the preferred model (with CS and PD), it is found that demand type shocks explain almost all the fluctuation in CPI inflation, the monetary shock being the most important (39%). Remarkably, foreign disturbances account for 34% of the output fluctuations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Over 80% of the currently occupied range of the jaguar (Panthera onca) lies in the Amazon. However, few density estimates exist for this habitat. Between 2005 and 2010 we carried out six camera trap surveys at three different sites in the department of Madre de Dios in the Peruvian Amazon. We analyzed our data using a Bayesian spatially explicit capture recapture model (SECR) with sex covariates to account for differences in home range size and detection probabilities of male and female jaguars. As several of our camera grids where too small for reliable density estimates, we used estimates for the σ parameter from the largest camera grid to correct for the bias. Density estimates for our surveys were similar with an average density of 4.4±0.7 jaguar 100km-2. Both home range size and encounter rates varied significantly between sexes with males having a larger home range and higher encounter rate than females. Our estimated sex ratio was 1:1.5 compared to an observed ratio of 1.9:1. Not accounting for sex would have resulted in an underestimation of the true density. The densities found in this study are among the highest documented and show that the Amazon is indeed a core habitat for the jaguar. We estimate that three jaguar conservation units in our study region (areas defined by experts as having a high conservation priority) could harbor as many as 6000 jaguars (CI: 4278-8142). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Bostryx is largely distributed in Andean Valleys and Lomas formations along the coast of Peru and Chile. One species, Bostryx aguilari, is restricted to Lomas formations located in the Department of Lima (Peru). The use of genetic information has become essential in phylogenetic and population studies with conservation purposes. Considering the rapid degradation of desert ecosystems, which threatens the survival of vulnerable species, the aim of this study was, first, to resolve evolutionary relationships within Bostryx and to determine the position of Bostryx within the Bulimulidae, and second, to survey the genetic diversity of Bostryx aguilari, a species considered rare. Sequences of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA and nuclear rRNA regions were obtained for 12 and 11 species of Bulimulidae, respectively, including seven species of Bostryx. Sequences of the 16S rRNA gene were obtained for 14 individuals (from four different populations) of Bostryx aguilari. Phylogenetic reconstructions were carried out using Neighbor-Joining, Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference methods. The monophyly of Bostryx was not supported. In our results, B. solutus (type species of Bostryx) grouped only with B. aguilari, B. conspersus, B. modestus, B. scalariformis and B. sordidus, forming a monophyletic group that is strongly supported in all analyses. In case the taxonomy of Bostryx is reviewed in the future, this group should keep the generic name. Bostryx aguilari was found to have both low genetic diversity and small population size. We recommend that conservation efforts should be increased in Lomas ecosystems to ensure the survival of B. aguilari, and a large number of other rare species restricted to Lomas. © 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.","Anopheline specimens were collected in 2011 by human landing catch, Shannon and CDC traps from the malaria endemic localities of Santa Rosa and San Pedro in Madre de Dios Department, Peru. Most specimens were either Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) benarrochi B or An. (Nys.) rangeli, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism-internal transcribed spacer 2 (PCR-RFLP-ITS2) and, for selected individuals, ITS2 sequences. A few specimens from Lupuna, Loreto Department, northern Amazonian Peru, were also identified as An. benarrochi B. A statistical parsimony network using ITS2 sequences confirmed that all Peruvian An. benarrochi B analyzed were identical to those in GenBank from Putumayo, southern Colombia. Sequences of the mtDNA COI BOLD region of specimens from all three Peruvian localities were connected using a statistical parsimony network, although there were multiple mutation steps between northern and southern Peruvian sequences. A Bayesian inference of concatenated Peruvian sequences of ITS2+COI detected a single clade with very high support for all An. benarrochi B except one individual from Lupuna that was excluded. No samples were positive for Plasmodium by CytB-PCR.

Until recently, their taxonomy was not clearly established, with discrepancies between morphological and molecular analyses. Here, Pseudoplatystoma species from the Peruvian Amazon were characterized at the molecular level from a sample representing the observed range of their color pattern variations in the study area. Analyses were performed using seven microsatellite loci for 103 specimens and, for part of them (52), using sequences of two regions of their mitochondrial genome [Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI) and Control Region (CR)]. Factorial correspondence analysis and assignment tests based on microsatellite polymorphism showed that the specimens originally identified as P. punctifer belonged to two different gene pools highly differentiated from P. tigrinum. Morphological examination identified two different morphotypes (with and without black stripes), suggesting the existence of two distinct taxa within P. punctifer. This result was corroborated by the ML tree based on CR sequences, where all individuals but four clustered in a similar way as in the FCA and Bayesian assignment tests. For these four individuals, mitochondrial introgression or retention of ancestral polymorphism was likely. In contrast, the ML tree based on COI sequences showed that reciprocal monophyly was not yet achieved for this marker for the two P. punctifer taxa. The existence of three sympatric species of Pseudoplatystoma in the Peruvian Amazon is discussed in relation to their molecular characteristics, color patterns and ecology. Evolutionary scenarios regarding their divergence are hypothesized. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","With 788 species in 67 genera in the Neotropics, Arecaceae are an important ecological and economic component of the region. We review the influence of geological events such as the Pebas system, the Andean uplift and the land connections between South and Central/North America, on the historical assembly of Neotropical palms. We present a case study of the palm genus Astrocaryum (40 species) as a model for evaluating colonization and diversification patterns of lowland Neotropical taxa. We conducted a Bayesian dated phylogenetic analysis based on four low-copy nuclear DNA regions and a biogeographical analysis using the dispersal, extinction and cladogenesis model. Cladogenesis of Western Amazonian Astrocaryum spp. (c.6Mya) post-dated the drainage of the aquatic Pebas system, supporting the constraining role of Pebas on in situ diversification and colonization. The ancestral distribution of Astrocaryum spp. in the Guiana Shield supported the hypothesis of an old formation that acted as a source area from which species colonized adjacent regions, but an earliest branching position for Guianan species was not confidently recovered. A twofold increase in diversification rate was found in a clade, the ancestor of which occupied the Guiana Shield (c.13Mya, a time of climatic change and Andean uplift). © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.","The so-called \"Taygetis clade\" is a group of exclusively Neotropical butterflies classified within Euptychiina, one of the largest subtribes in the subfamily Satyrinae. Since the distribution of the ten genera belonging to this group ranges throughout the entire Neotropics, from lowlands to lower montane habitats, it offers a remarkable opportunity to study the region's biogeographic history as well as different scenarios for speciation in upland areas. We inferred a robust and well-sampled phylogeny using DNA sequences from four genes (4035. bp in total) using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. We estimated divergence times using the Bayesian relaxed clock method calibrated with node ages from previous studies. Ancestral ranges of distribution were estimated using the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model as implemented in the program Lagrange. We propose several taxonomic changes and recognize nine well-supported natural genera within the \"Taygetis clade\": Forsterinaria (subsuming Guaianaza syn. nov.), Parataygetis, Posttaygetis, Harjesia (excluding Harjesia griseola and Harjesia oreba), Pseudodebis (including Taygetomorpha syn. nov.,), Taygetina (subsuming Coeruleotaygetis syn. nov., Harjesia oreba comb. nov., Taygetis weymeri comb. nov. and Taygetis kerea comb. nov.), Taygetis (excluding Taygetis ypthima, Taygetis rectifascia, Taygetis kerea and Taygetis weymeri), and two new genera, one containing Harjesia griseola, and the other Taygetis ypthima and Taygetis rectifascia. The group diversified mainly during late Miocene to Pliocene, coinciding with the period of drastic changes in landscape configuration in the Neotropics. Major dispersals inferred from the Amazon basin towards northwestern South America, the Atlantic forests and the eastern slope of the Andes have mostly shaped the evolution and diversification of the group. Furthermore, expansion of larval dietary repertoire might have aided net diversification in the two largest genera in the clade, Forsterinaria and Taygetis. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Phylogeographic patterns and sex-biased dispersal were studied in riverine populations of West Indian (Trichechus manatus) and Amazonian manatees (T. inunguis) in South America, using 410bp D-loop (Control Region, Mitochondrial DNA) sequences and 15 nuclear microsatellite loci. This multi-locus approach was key to disentangle complex patterns of gene flow among populations. D-loop analyses revealed population structuring among all Colombian rivers for T. manatus, while microsatellite data suggested no structure. Two main populations of T. inunguis separating the Colombian and Peruvian Amazon were supported by analysis of the D-loop and microsatellite data. Overall, we provide molecular evidence for differences in dispersal patterns between sexes, demonstrating male-biased gene flow dispersal in riverine manatees. These results are in contrast with previously reported levels of population structure shown by microsatellite data in marine manatee populations, revealing low habitat restrictions to gene flow in riverine habitats, and more significant dispersal limitations for males in marine environments. © 2012 Satizábal et al.","Tree growth response across environmental gradients is fundamental to understanding species distributional ecology and forest ecosystem ecology and to predict future ecosystem services. Cross-sectional patterns of ecosystem properties with respect to climatic gradients are often used to predict ecosystem responses to global change. Across sites in the tropics, primary productivity increases with temperature, suggesting that forest ecosystems will become more productive as temperature rises. However, this trend is confounded with a shift in species composition and so may not reflect the response of in situ forests to warming. In this study, we simultaneously studied tree diameter growth across the altitudinal ranges of species within a single genus across a geographically compact temperature gradient, to separate the direct effect of temperature on tree growth from that of species compositional turnover. Using a Bayesian state space modeling framework we combined data from repeated diameter censuses and dendrometer measurements from across a 1700-m altitudinal gradient collected over six years on over 2400 trees in Weinmannia, a dominant and widespread genus of cloud forest trees in the Andes. Within species, growth showed no consistent trend with altitude, but higher-elevation species had lower growth rates than lowerelevation species, suggesting that species turnover is largely responsible for the positive correlation between productivity and temperature in tropical forests. Our results may indicate a significant difference in how low- and high-latitude forests will respond to climate change, since temperate and boreal tree species are consistently observed to have a positive relationship between growth and temperature. If our results hold for other tropical species, a positive response in ecosystem productivity to increasing temperatures in the Andes will depend on the altitudinal migration of tree species. The rapid pace of climate change, and slow observed rates of migration, suggest a slow, or even initially negative response of ecosystem productivity to warming. Finally, this study shows how the observed scale of biological organization can affect conclusions drawn from studies of ecological phenomena across environmental gradients, and calls into question the common practice in tropical ecology of lumping species at higher taxonomic levels. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","Polylepis woodlands are a vital resource for preserving biodiversity and hydrological functions, which will be altered by climate change and challenge the sustainability of local human communities. However, these high-altitude Andean ecosystems are becoming increasingly vulnerable due to anthropogenic pressure including fragmentation, deforestation and the increase in livestock. Predicting the distribution of native woodlands has become increasingly important to counteract the negative effects of climate change through reforestation and conservation. The objective of this study was to develop and analyze the distribution models of two species that form extensive woodlands along the Andes, namely Polylepis sericea and P. weberbaueri. This study utilized the program Maxent, climate and remotely sensed environmental layers at 1 Km resolution. The predicted distribution model for P. sericea indicated that the species could be located in a variety of habitats along the Andean Cordillera, while P. weberbaueri was restricted to the high elevations of southern Peru and Bolivia. For both species, elevation and temperature metrics were the most significant factors for predicted distribution. Further model refinement of Polylepis and other Andean species using increasingly available satellite data demonstrate the potential to help define areas of diversity and improve conservation strategies for the Andes. © Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas UNMSM.","A global phylogeny for chelonid fibropapilloma-associated herpesvirus (CFPHV), the most likely aetiological agent of fibropapillomatosis (FP) in sea turtles, was inferred, using dated sequences, through Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis and used to estimate the virus evolutionary rate independent of the evolution of the host, and to resolve the phylogenetic positions of new haplotypes from Puerto Rico and the Gulf of Guinea. Four phylogeographical groups were identified: eastern Pacific, western Atlantic/eastern Caribbean, mid-west Pacific and Atlantic. The latter comprises the Gulf of Guinea and Puerto Rico, suggesting recent virus gene flow between these two regions. One virus haplotype from Florida remained elusive, representing either an independent lineage sharing a common ancestor with all other identified virus variants or an Atlantic representative of the lineage giving rise to the eastern Pacific group. The virus evolutionary rate ranged from 1.62×10 -4 to 2.22×10 -4 substitutions per site per year, which is much faster than what is expected for a herpesvirus. The mean time for the most recent common ancestor of the modern virus variants was estimated at 192.90-429.71 years ago, which, although more recent than previous estimates, still supports an interpretation that the global FP pandemic is not the result of a recent acquisition of a virulence mutation(s). The phylogeographical pattern obtained seems partially to reflect sea turtle movements, whereas altered environments appear to be implicated in current FP outbreaks and in the modern evolutionary history of CFPHV. © 2012 SGM.","Doryteuthis gahi is a small squid species that has a wide distribution in South America. This species is characterized by coastal and benthic spawning, and its ontogenetic vertical migration is associated with upwelling zones, features that may restrict its dispersal potential. It has also been proposed that populations of these neritic squid are structured by the influence of local processes which act as barriers to gene flow. Based on this background, we evaluate the geographical structure of genetic diversity in D. gahi along its distribution in the south-eastern Pacific Ocean. We used 116 COI mtDNA sequences of squid collected from different sites in Peru and Chile and calculated genetic diversity, the population structure index Fst, and performed analysis of spatial molecular variance and exact tests to detect differences among localities. To infer demographic history we carried out tests of neutrality and Bayesian skyline analysis. Although there was little molecular divergence between Peru and Chile, we detected a significant genetic differentiation of D. gahi along its geographical distribution. Squid from Chile showed higher genetic diversity than those of Peru and the results of the demographic inference analysis suggest that the population of Peru is experiencing or experienced in the recent past demographic expansion, a pattern that was not found in Chile. We think that the current genetic patterns are consequences of northward migrations in the glaciation periods and posterior re-colonization of southern Chile in the deglacial period.

This new model includes the Beta regression model introduced by Ferrari and Cribari-Neto (2004) and the variable dispersion Beta regression model introduced by Smithson and Verkuilen (2006) as particular cases. Like Branscum, Johnson, and Thurmond (2007), a Bayesian inference approach is adopted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. Simulation studies on the influence of outliers by considering contaminated data under four perturbation patterns to generate outliers were carried out and confirm that the Beta rectangular regression model seems to be a new robust alternative for modeling proportion data and that the Beta regression model shows sensitivity to the estimation of regression coeficients, to the posterior distribution of all parameters and to the model comparison criteria considered. Furthermore, two applications are presented to illustrate the robustness of the Beta rectangular model. © 2012 International Society for Bayesian Analysis.","Phylogenetic relationships of Orthalicoidea, a highly diverse and dominant element in the Neotropics, were studied using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences (ITS2/28S, CO1, H3). Specimens of various locations from the Southern Hemisphere (South America, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Solomon Islands) were analysed (74 taxa, representing 30 genera). Our results support previously presented hypotheses, but also give surprises in terms of unexpected topologies. Phylogenetic trees were estimated using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference, and compared with traditional classifications. Phylogenetic estimations using three loci gave a strong support for monophyly of Orthalicoidea, as well as for some clades within this group (Bulimulidae, Bothriembryontidae, Orthalicidae, Amphibulimulidae), but not for others (Odontostomidae and Megaspiridae). In the resulting revision of the classification scheme of the Orthalicoidea, the tribe Simpulopsini is raised to family rank. One new subfamily is recognized, the Bostrycinae. The family Bulimulidae Tryon 1867 is retained under ICZN Art. 35.5, despite the senior synonymy of Peltellinae Gray 1855. Our analysis supports an origin of the Orthalicoidea in South America, with subsequent radiations into other parts of the Neotropics and the Southern Hemisphere. The hypothesis that the distribution on the southern continents may be explained by vicariance due to break-up of Gondwana is only partially supported by divergence time analysis using fossil calibrations. Ancestral area reconstruction suggests various independent dispersals out of South America into Central America and the West Indies, and possibly two independent dispersals to explain the remaining relations between groups of taxa on the southern continents. Divergence time analysis further shows that the major diversification of extant taxa within the superfamily may have started around the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. © E.

The subgenus can be split geographically, with almost equal diversity in the Northern Hemisphere (centred in Mexico and Guatemala) and in the Southern Hemisphere (centred in Peru and Bolivia). Only a few species are known from a limited number of localities between these two hotspots. As such, Tildenia is an ideal candidate with which to test time, direction and mode of migration of high mountain taxa against the background of the 'Great American Biotic Interchange'. Location The Andes with focus on the Central Andes, and the Mexican mountain chains, especially the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Methods To elucidate the spatio-temporal origin, subsequent colonization and radiation of Tildenia, we combine Bayesian phylogenetics based on the chloroplast trnK-matK-psbA region, georeferenced distribution data, and fossil calibrated molecular dating approaches using both penalized likelihood and relaxed phylogenetics. Reconstruction of the ancestral distribution area was performed using dispersal-vicariance analysis and dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis. Results Peperomia subgenus Tildenia is subdivided into six Andean clades and one Mexican and Central American clade originating from a north/central Peruvian ancestor. Molecular dating approaches converge on a stem age of c.38Ma for Tildenia and a mostly Miocene diversification and colonization. Main conclusions We detect a strong correlation between diversification of Tildenia and orogenetic events in the respective distribution centres. In the Andes, distribution was influenced by the Altiplano-Eastern Cordillera System as well as the Amotape-Huancabamba Zone, where the latter serves as both migration barrier and migration bridge for different clades. In contrast to most studies of high-elevation taxa, we provide support for a south-north colonization towards Central America and Mexico, and provide additional, independent evidence for the latest view on the timing of the Great American Biotic Interchange. In Mexico, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt has played a major role in more recent radiations together with climatic oscillation and the formation of refugia. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Solanum morelliforme is an epiphytic wild potato (Solanum section Petota) species widely distributed throughout central Mexico to Honduras. A strikingly disjunct (approximately 4,000 km) population was recently discovered in Bolivia, representing the first record of this species in South America, and the first species in the section growing in both North and Central America and in South America. Our maximum entropy analysis of 19 climatic variables matches the occurrence of the South American locality with great precision. It demonstrates the strong predictive quality of this procedure and suggests similar localities where this species may be found, especially along the eastern slopes of the Andes in the Yungas region of southern Peru and Bolivia. In addition, the presence of S. morelliforme in South America adds to emerging data from yet other sources to question long-held hypotheses of the origin of section Petota in North and Central America. © Copyright 2011 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.","Background and aims - The pantropical genus Peperomia consists of approximately 1,600 species with an extremely diverse vegetative morphology, especially in the Neotropics. One of the most startling yet overlooked growth forms is the geophytic one, as in subgenus Tildenia. This group occurs in seasonal Neotropical habitats with its highest diversity in Mexico-Guatemala and Peru-Bolivia with few species known from in between these hot spots. Methods - Recent fieldwork in Peru and Bolivia combined with herbarium study and a Bayesian analysis of an aligned sequence matrix of the chloroplast trnK-matK-psbA gene cluster of one accession of each species resulted in new findings within this subgenus. Key results - Fourteen new species are described, discussed in a phylogenetic framework and illustrated. Two species have a wide distribution and occur from central W. Peru to S. Bolivia: the common P. cerrateae and the rare P. parvisagittata. Three endemic species are described from the Amotape-Huancabamba Zone which is particularly rich in tuberous Peperomia species: P. gigantea, P. jalcaensis and P. klopfensteinii. Two species are only known from their type locality in central W. Peru: P. ocrosensis and P. pugnicaudex. Five other Peruvian species are P. ayacuchoana from Ayacucho, P. querocochana from Ancash, P. wernerrauhii from Huánuco, Peperomia umbrosa from three distant localities, and P. pseudoverruculosa which is relatively common in SE Peru. Two species are Bolivian endemics: the rare P. purpureonervosa from La Paz and the more common P. radiatinervosa from Cochabamba and Chuquisaca. Two former varieties, both endemics of the extreme northern Central Andes, are raised to species rank: P. lilliputiana and P. pseudoperuviana. Finally, basionym rejection and lectotypification are proposed for the widespread and commonly collected tuberous Peperomia in the southern Central Andes: P. peruviana.

Since 2000, there has been sustained low P. falciparum transmission. The Malaria Immunology and Genetics in the Amazon project has longitudinally followed members of the community of Zungarococha (N = 1,945, 4 villages) with active household and health center-based visits each year since 2003. We examined parasite population structure and traced the parasite genetic diversity temporally and spatially. We genotyped infections over 5 years (2003-2007) using 14 microsatellite (MS) markers scattered across ten different chromosomes. Despite low transmission, there was considerable genetic diversity, which we compared with other geographic regions. We detected 182 different haplotypes from 302 parasites in 217 infections. Structure v2.2 identified five clusters (subpopulations) of phylogenetically related clones. To consider genetic diversity on a more detailed level, we defined haplotype families (hapfams) by grouping haplotypes with three or less loci differences. We identified 34 different hapfams identified. The Fst statistic and heterozygosity analysis showed the five clusters were maintained in each village throughout this time. A minimum spanning network (MSN), stratified by the year of detection, showed that haplotypes within hapfams had allele differences and haplotypes within a cluster definition were more separated in the later years (2006-2007). We modeled hapfam detection and loss, accounting for sample size and stochastic fluctuations in frequencies overtime. Principle component analysis of genetic variation revealed patterns of genetic structure with time rather than village. The population structure, genetic diversity, appearance/disappearance of the different haplotypes from 2003 to 2007 provides a genome-wide \"real-time\" perspective of P. falciparum parasites in a low transmission region. © 2011 The Author.","During the late Pleistocene-Holocene, the Humboldt Current System (HCS, Peru-Chile) was subject to important oceanographic variations that may have affected the abundance and distribution of marine populations, as well as their genetic structure and diversity. The fast growth and short life span of jumbo squid Dosidicus gigas make this squid a valuable model organism for evaluating how environmental fluctuations affect the genetic diversity of marine populations. We sequenced a 657 bp fragment of the mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene of 169 jumbo squids from 6 locations in the HCS. We measured and compared genetic diversity among localities and performed neutrality tests to detect deviation from mutation-drift equilibrium. We inferred the demographic history of jumbo squids using Bayesian skyline analyses to estimate effective population size through time. A total of 23 haplotypes were found among the sequences. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity were low in all locations. D. gigas was characterized by an absence of population genetic structure and a star-like haplotype network. Neutrality test values were negative and statistically significant, and therefore consistent with a past population expansion. Similarly, Bayesian skyline analyses indicated a recent demographic expansion after the last glacial maximum. Our results suggest that D. gigas consists of a single, large population in the HCS, that may have experienced a dramatic demographic popu lation expansion consistent with the oceanographic changes associated with the last glacial- interglacial transition. © Inter-Research 2011.","Knowledge of genetic diversity in farmers' selections is essential for planning on-farm conservation and rehabilitation. Using 15 microsatellite loci, we analyzed parentage and population structure in 220 farmer selections of cacao from the Huallaga valley in Peruvian Amazon. A high level of allele richness and heterozygosity were detected in these selections. Coordination analysis showed that these farmer selections are mainly comprised of hybrids derived from Trinitario and Upper Amazon Forastero germplasm. Bayesian clustering analysis assigned 54 selections as Trinitario and 166 as Upper Amazon Forastero hybrids. Parentage analysis identified 15 international clones as probable parents for 96 farmer selections, which corresponded to a fraction of the known hybrid families disseminated in this region in the late 1980s. Combined analysis of demographic and molecular data revealed a significant spatial autocorrelation (r = 0.235; P = 0.006) at short geographical distances (>5. 0 km). This patch-like distribution of spatial heterogeneity suggests a significant \"neighborhood effects\" in seeds distribution or variety adoption, where closely related hybrid progenies were adopted in the neighboring farms or villages. The outcomes of this study indicate that in spite of the introgressions of exotic germplasm in the past, Upper Amazon Forastero is still the dominant component in the Huallaga valley of Peru. The high level of on-farm diversity can offer needed variability for participatory selection of superior clones in this low input, small-scale production system, where adaptability to specific environment is more preferred than in a high input, large scale production system. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).","Aims: To present a new approach for estimating the \"true prevalence\" of malaria and apply it to datasets from Peru, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Methods: Bayesian models were developed for estimating both the malaria prevalence using different diagnostic tests (microscopy, PCR & ELISA), without the need of a gold standard, and the tests' characteristics. Several sources of information, i.e. data, expert opinions and other sources of knowledge can be integrated into the model. This approach resulting in an optimal and harmonized estimate of malaria infection prevalence, with no conflict between the different sources of information, was tested on data from Peru, Vietnam and Cambodia. Results: Malaria sero-prevalence was relatively low in all sites, with ELISA showing the highest estimates. The sensitivity of microscopy and ELISA were statistically lower in Vietnam than in the other sites. Similarly, the specificities of microscopy, ELISA and PCR were significantly lower in Vietnam than in the other sites. In Vietnam and Peru, microscopy was closer to the \"true\" estimate than the other 2 tests while as expected ELISA, with its lower specificity, usually overestimated the prevalence. Conclusions: Bayesian methods are useful for analyzing prevalence results when no gold standard diagnostic test is available. Though some results are expected, e.g. PCR more sensitive than microscopy, a standardized and context-independent quantification of the diagnostic tests' characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) and the underlying malaria prevalence may be useful for comparing different sites. Indeed, the use of a single diagnostic technique could strongly bias the prevalence estimation. This limitation can be circumvented by using a Bayesian framework taking into account the imperfect characteristics of the currently available diagnostic tests. As discussed in the paper, this approach may further support global malaria burden estimation initiatives. © 2011 Speybroeck et al.","Background:The history of Chagas disease control in Peru and many other nations is marked by scattered and poorly documented vector control campaigns. The complexities of human migration and sporadic control campaigns complicate evaluation of the burden of Chagas disease and dynamics of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission.Methodology/Principal Findings:We conducted a cross-sectional serological and entomological study to evaluate temporal and spatial patterns of T. cruzi transmission in a peri-rural region of La Joya, Peru. We use a multivariate catalytic model and Bayesian methods to estimate incidence of infection over time and thereby elucidate the complex history of transmission in the area. Of 1,333 study participants, 101 (7.6%; 95% CI: 6.2-9.0%) were confirmed T. cruzi seropositive. Spatial clustering of parasitic infection was found in vector insects, but not in human cases. Expanded catalytic models suggest that transmission was interrupted in the study area in 1996 (95% credible interval: 1991-2000), with a resultant decline in the average annual incidence of infection from 0.9% (95% credible interval: 0.6-1.3%) to 0.1% (95% credible interval: 0.005-0.3%). Through a search of archival newspaper reports, we uncovered documentation of a 1995 vector control campaign, and thereby independently validated the model estimates.Conclusions/Significance:High levels of T. cruzi transmission had been ongoing in peri-rural La Joya prior to interruption of parasite transmission through a little-documented vector control campaign in 1995. Despite the efficacy of the 1995 control campaign, T. cruzi was rapidly reemerging in vector populations in La Joya, emphasizing the need for continuing surveillance and control at the rural-urban interface.","Sharks are a diverse and ecologically important group, including some of the ocean's largest predatory animals. Sharks are also commercially important, with many species suffering overexploitation and facing extinction. However, despite a long evolutionary history, commercial, and conservation importance, phylogenetic relationships within the sharks are poorly understood. To date, most studies have either focused on smaller clades within sharks, or sampled taxa sparsely across the group. A more detailed species-level phylogeny will offer further insights into shark taxonomy, provide a tool for comparative analyses, as well as facilitating phylogenetic estimates of conservation priorities. We used four mitochondrial and one nuclear gene to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of 229 species (all eight Orders and 31 families) of sharks, more than quadrupling the number of taxon sampled in any prior study. The resulting Bayesian phylogenetic hypothesis agrees with prior studies on the major relationships of the sharks phylogeny; however, on those relationships that have proven more controversial, it differs in several aspects from the most recent molecular studies. The phylogeny supports the division of sharks into two major groups, the Galeomorphii and Squalimorphii, rejecting the hypnosqualean hypothesis that places batoids within sharks. Within the squalimorphs the orders Hexanchiformes, Squatiniformes, Squaliformes, and Pristiophoriformes are broadly monophyletic, with minor exceptions apparently due to missing data. Similarly, within Galeomorphs, the orders Heterodontiformes, Lamniformes, Carcharhiniformes, and Orectolobiformes are broadly monophyletic, with a couple of species 'misplaced'. In contrast, many of the currently recognized shark families are not monophyletic according to our results. Our phylogeny offers some of the first clarification of the relationships among families of the order Squaliformes, a group that has thus far received relatively little phylogenetic attention. Our results suggest that the genus Echinorhinus is not a squaliform, but rather related to the saw sharks, a hypothesis that might be supported by both groups sharing 'spiny' snouts. In sum, our results offer the most detailed species-level phylogeny of sharks to date and a tool for comparative analyses. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Estimating the geographic range of a species can be complicated by insufficient occurrence data and a lack of information about range limit determinants. Accurate estimates of species distributions are needed to assess the impacts of anthropogenic actions and for exploring evolutionary and ecological processes that maintain biological diversity. After documenting several extralimital locations for Black-fronted Ground-Tyrants (Muscisaxicola frontalis; Tyrannidae), we questioned the accuracy of the current winter range estimate. We provide specimen and observation records from central and southern Peru that represent new information about the winter distribution of Black-fronted Ground-Tyrants. We used ecological niche models generated from new extralimital records and records from the winter range to assess the current range estimate. We also tested winter and extralimital niche models for model equivalency using a resampling technique available through Maxent and ENM Tools. Niche models developed with locations from the winter range predicted with high probability (>90%) the area of the extralimital records. Reciprocally, niche models developed with the extralimital locations predicted the majority of the winter range locations, although the probability was lower for some locations and the most southerly points were not included in the prediction. The test for model equivalency did not distinguish the two models, suggesting the possibility that the extralimital records were from poorly sampled areas of the true winter range. Smaller scale habitat associations of Black-fronted Ground-Tyrants, such as a preference for sparsely vegetated slopes, were documented that were more specific than published accounts. Finally, we present the first case of frugivory in Muscisaxicola with the identification of Cumulopuntia boliviana ignescens (Cactaceae) seeds and pericarp in all five stomach samples of Black-fronted Ground-Tyrants collected in southern Peru. © 2011 Association of Field Ornithologists.","We have inferred the most comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis to date of butterflies in the tribe Satyrini. In order to obtain a hypothesis of relationships, we used maximum parsimony and model-based methods with 4435 bp of DNA sequences from mitochondrial and nuclear genes for 179 taxa (130 genera and eight out-groups). We estimated dates of origin and diversification for major clades, and performed a biogeographic analysis using a dispersal-vicariance framework, in order to infer a scenario of the biogeographical history of the group. We found long-branch taxa that affected the accuracy of all three methods. Moreover, different methods produced incongruent phylogenies. We found that Satyrini appeared around 42 Mya in either the Neotropical or the Eastern Palaearctic, Oriental, and/or Indo-Australian regions, and underwent a quick radiation between 32 and 24 Mya, during which time most of its component subtribes originated. Several factors might have been important for the diversification of Satyrini: the ability to feed on grasses; early habitat shift into open, non-forest habitats; and geographic bridges, which permitted dispersal over marine barriers, enabling the geographic expansions of ancestors to new environments that provided opportunities for geographic differentiation, and diversification.'To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail'.

They are caused by different reasons: degenerative, by trauma, etc., being flat foots a common pathology in Peru with high incidence. However there isn't the properly technology to detect properly this disease because is detected by a non-reliable visual way using pedoscopes. Flat foot is the degree of internal plantar arch lack and is well observed in foot pressure distribution. This distribution can be obtained by optical or electronic systems. The most required, by their accuracy, are the electronic ones but sensor manufacturing process increases its price, meanwhile optics provides an indirect optical solution whose price depends on scanners resolution. Therefore, this paper takes advantage of both systems: a direct pressure value from electronics and no problems calibration from optical systems. In regard of these reasons, prototype will use a webcam and twelve FSR (Force sensing resistor) sensors including estimation techniques, and thus obtain the foot pressure distribution. Accordingly, the present study is looking for providing to the specialist with an efficient tool to generate better diagnostics in Perú. © 2010 IEEE.","Attempts by biogeographers to understand biotic diversification in the Amazon have often employed contemporary species distribution patterns to support particular theories, such as Pleistocene rainforest refugia, rather than to test among alternative hypotheses. Suture zones, narrow regions where multiple contact zones and hybrid zones between taxa cluster, have been seen as evidence for past expansion of whole biotas that have undergone allopatric divergence in vicariant refuges. We used coalescent analysis of mutilocus sequence data to examine population split times in 22 pairs of geminate taxa in ithomiine and heliconiine butterflies. We test a hypothesis of simultaneous divergence across a suture zone in NE Peru. Our results reveal a scattered time course of diversification in this suture zone, rather than a tight cluster of split times. Additionally, we find rapid diversification within some lineages such as Melinaea contrasting with older divergence within lineages such as the Oleriina (Hyposcada and Oleria). These results strongly reject simple vicariance as a cause of the suture zone. At the same time, observed lineage effects are incompatible with a series of geographically coincident vicariant events which should affect all lineages similarly. Our results suggest that Pleistocene climatic forcing cannot readily explain this Peruvian suture zone. Lineage-specific biological traits, such as characteristic distances of gene flow or varying rates of parapatric divergence, may be of greater importance. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","We investigated demographic history and population structuring of Colossoma macropomum sampled from 14 localities in the Amazon basin and the Bolivian sub-basin; the two basins are separated by a series of 16 rapids. Although genetically differentiated, IMa analyses suggest non-zero bi-directional migration rates, and inter-basin divergence of approximately 17 thousand years ago. Analyses in BEAST indicated that Bolivian C. macropomum has been demographically stable except for a moderate population increase in the last 12 thousand years, while Amazonian C. macropomum has been experiencing demographic growth over the last 350 thousand years, resulting in approximately one order of magnitude increase in coalescent Ne. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Wild potato contains about 100 species that are native to the Americas from the southwestern United States to central Chile and adjacent Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and southern Brazil. We report the occurrence of naturalized populations of the wild potato Solanum chacoense in seven sites in southern Australia, eastern China, England, New Zealand, the eastern United States, central Peru, and east-central Argentina. Modeling similar climatic niches on the basis of the distribution of S. chacoense from South America shows that observations of naturalized S. chacoense overlap with predicted areas.

Peru is one of the Latin American countries with the highest malaria burden, mainly due to Plasmodium vivax infections. However, little is known about P. vivax transmission dynamics in the Peruvian Amazon, where most malaria cases occur. The genetic diversity and population structure of P. vivax isolates collected in different communities around Iquitos city, the capital of the Peruvian Amazon, was determined. Methods. Plasmodium vivax population structure was determined by multilocus genotyping with 16 microsatellites on 159 P. vivax infected blood samples (mono-infections) collected in four sites around Iquitos city. The population characteristics were assessed only in samples with monoclonal infections (n = 94), and the genetic diversity was determined by calculating the expected heterozygosity and allelic richness. Both linkage disequilibrium and the genetic differentiation () were estimated. Results. The proportion of polyclonal infections varied substantially by site (11% - 70%), with the expected heterozygosity ranging between 0.44 and 0.69; no haplotypes were shared between the different populations. Linkage disequilibrium was present in all populations (IAS 0.14 - 0.61) but was higher in those with fewer polyclonal infections, suggesting inbreeding and a clonal population structure. Strong population differentiation ( = 0.45) was found and the Bayesian inference cluster analysis identified six clusters based on distinctive allele frequencies. Conclusion. The P. vivax populations circulating in the Peruvian Amazon basin are genetically diverse, strongly differentiated and they have a low effective recombination rate. These results are in line with the low and clustered pattern of malaria transmission observed in the region around Iquitos city. © 2010 Van den Eede et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","We report a rapid radiation of a group of butterflies within the family Nymphalidae and examine some aspects of popular analytical methods in dealing with rapid radiations. We attempted to infer the phylogeny of butterflies belonging to the subtribe Coenonymphina sensu lato using five genes (4398 bp) with Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analyses. Initial analyses suggested that the group has undergone rapid speciation within Australasia. We further analyzed the dataset with different outgroup combinations the choice of which had a profound effect on relationships within the ingroup. Modelling methods recovered Coenonymphina as a monophyletic group to the exclusion of Zipaetis and Orsotriaena, irrespective of outgroup combination. Maximum Parsimony occasionally returned a polyphyletic Coenonymphina, with Argyronympha grouping with outgroups, but this was strongly dependent on the outgroups used. We analyzed the ingroup without any outgroups and found that the relationships inferred among taxa were different from those inferred when either of the outgroup combinations was used, and this was true for all methods. We also tested whether a hard polytomy is a better hypothesis to explain our dataset, but could not find conclusive evidence. We therefore conclude that the major lineages within Coenonymphina form a near-hard polytomy with regard to each other. The study highlights the importance of testing different outgroups rather than using results from a single outgroup combination of a few taxa, particularly in difficult cases where basal nodes appear to receive low support. We provide a revised classification of Coenonymphina; Zipaetis and Orsotriaena are transferred to the tribe Eritina. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.","A Bayesian inference approach using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is developed for the logistic positive exponent (LPE) model proposed by Samejima and for a new skewed Logistic Item Response Theory (IRT) model, named Reflection LPE model. Both models lead to asymmetric item characteristic curves (ICC) and can be appropriate because a symmetric ICC treats both correct and incorrect answers symmetrically, which results in a logical contradiction in ordering examinees on the ability scale. A data set corresponding to a mathematical test applied in Peruvian public schools is analyzed, where comparisons with other parametric IRT models also are conducted. Several model comparison criteria are discussed and implemented. The main conclusion is that the LPE and RLPE IRT models are easy to implement and seem to provide the best fit to the data set considered. © 2010 AERA.","We review several asymmetrical links for binary regression models and present a unified approach for two skew-probit links proposed in the literature. Moreover, under skew-probit link, conditions for the existence of the ML estimators and the posterior distribution under improper priors are established. The framework proposed here considers two sets of latent variables which are helpful to implement the Bayesian MCMC approach. A simulation study to criteria for models comparison is conducted and two applications are made. Using different Bayesian criteria we show that, for these data sets, the skew-probit links are better than alternative links proposed in the literature.","The genera Bostryx and Scutalus (Orthalicidae: Bulimulinae) are endemics from South America. They are mainly distributed on the western slopes of the Peruvian Andes. The goal of the present work was to assess their evolutionary position among the stylommatophoran gastropods based on the 16S rRNA mitochondrial marker. Four sequences were obtained, and along with 28 sequences of other Stylommatophora retrieved from the GenBank, were aligned with ClustalX. The phylogenetic reconstruction was carried out using the methods of Neighbor-Joining, Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference. The multiple sequence alignment had 371 sites, with indels. The two genera of the family Orthalicidae for the first time included in a molecular phylogeny (Bostryx and Scutalus), formed a monophyletic group along with another member of the superfamily Orthalicoidea (Placostylus), result that is comparable with that obtained with nuclear markers. Their evolutionary relationship with other land snails is also discussed. © 2009 Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas UNMSM.","empty","Measurement error models often arise in epidemiological and clinical research. Usually, in this set up it is assumed that the latent variable has a normal distribution. However, the normality assumption may not be always correct. Skew-normal/independent distribution is a class of asymmetric thick-tailed distributions which includes the skew-normal distribution as a special case. In this paper, we explore the use of skew-normal/independent distribution as a robust alternative to null intercept measurement error model under a Bayesian paradigm. We assume that the random errors and the unobserved value of the covariate (latent variable) follows jointly a skew-normal/independent distribution, providing an appealing robust alternative to the routine use of symmetric normal distribution in this type of model.

Previous work suggests there may be more than one subspecies, highlighting the need for further study. Here, we combine traditional and geometric morphometric analysis of skull shape and size with genetic data to compare two populations of South American fur seals, one from Uruguay and one from Peru. As a control group we used material from the closely related species Arctocephalus gazella. Both techniques of morphometric analysis reveal pronounced geographic variation in size and shape of the skull, with Peruvian specimens (n = 102) being larger than Uruguayan skulls (n = 133) and significant shape differences concentrated in the rostral region. Similarly, seven highly polymorphic microsatellite loci reveal highly significant differences in allele frequency. Moreover, Bayesian analysis implemented using the program structure reveals two separate clusters corresponding perfectly to the two populations, with an assignment test correctly placing over 98% of specimens in their population of origin. This degree of differentiation for both genetic and morphological traits suggests complete and possibly prolonged isolation to the extent that we believe these populations should be considered distinct evolutionarily significant units. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Background: Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte (CTL) response drives the evolution of HIV-1 at a host-level by selecting HLA-restricted escape mutations. Dissecting the dynamics of these escape mutations at a population-level would help to understand how HLA-mediated selection drives the evolution of HIV-1. Methodology/Principal Findings: We undertook a study of the dynamics of HIV-1 CTL-escape mutations by analyzing through statistical approaches and phylogenetic methods the viral gene gag sequenced in plasma samples collected between the years 1987 and 2006 from 302 drug-naïve HIV-positive patients. By applying logistic regression models and after performing correction for multiple test, we identified 22 potential CTL-escape mutations (p-value<0.05; q-value<0.2); 10 of these associations were confirmed in samples biologically independent by a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method. Analyzing their prevalence back in time we found that escape mutations that are the consensus residue in samples collected after 2003 have actually significantly increased in time in one of either B or F subtype until becoming the most frequent residue, while dominating the other viral subtype. Their estimated prevalence in the viral subtype they did not dominate was lower than 30% for the majority of samples collected at the end of the 80's. In addition, when screening the entire viral region, we found that the 75% of positions significantly changing in time (p<0.05) were located within known CTL epitopes. Conclusions: Across HIV Gag protein, the rise of polymorphisms from independent origin during the last twenty years of epidemic in our setting was related to an association with an HLA allele. The fact that these mutations accumulated in one of either B or F subtypes have also dominated the other subtype shows how this selection might be causing a convergence of viral subtypes to variants which are more likely to evade the immune response of the population where they circulate. © 2008 Dilernia et al.","Conservationists are increasingly relying on distribution models to predict where species are likely to occur, especially in poorly-surveyed but biodiverse areas. Modeling is challenging in these cases because locality data necessary for model formation are often scarce and spatially imprecise. To identify methods best suited to modeling in these conditions, we compared the success of three algorithms (Maxent, Mahalanobis Typicalities and Random Forests) at predicting distributions of eight bird and eight mammal species endemic to the eastern slopes of the central Andes. We selected study species to have a range of locality sample sizes representative of the data available for endemic species of this region and also that vary in their distribution characteristics. We found that for species that are known from moderate numbers (N = 38-94) of localities, the three methods performed similarly for species with restricted distributions but Maxent and Random Forests yielded better results for species with wider distributions. For species with small numbers of sample localities (N = 5-21), Maxent produced the most consistently successful results, followed by Random Forests and then Mahalanobis Typicalities. Because evaluation statistics for models derived from few localities can be suspect due to the poor spatial representation of the evaluation data, we corroborated these results with review by scientists familiar with the species in the field. Overall, Maxent appears to be the most capable method for modeling distributions of Andean bird and mammal species because of the consistency of results in varying conditions, although the other methods have strengths in certain situations. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","We investigated the dispersal, recruitment and migratory behaviour of the hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), among different life-history stages and demographic segments of the large hawksbill turtle aggregation at Mona Island, Puerto Rico. There were significant differences in both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype diversity and haplotype frequencies among the adult males, females and juveniles examined, but little evidence for temporal heterogeneity within these same groups sampled across years. Consistent with previous studies and the hypothesis of strong natal homing, there were striking mtDNA haplotype differences between nesting females on Mona Island and nesting females in other major Caribbean rookeries. Breeding males also showed strong, albeit weaker, genetic evidence of natal homing. Overall, Bayesian mixed-stock analysis suggests that Mona Island was the natal rookery for 79% (65-94%) of males in the aggregation. In contrast, the Mona Island rookery accounted for only a small subset of the new juvenile recruits to the foraging grounds or in the population of older juvenile hawksbills turtles on Mona. Instead, both new recruits and the older juvenile hawksbill turtles on Mona more likely recruited from other Caribbean rookeries, suggesting that a mechanism besides natal homing must be influencing recruitment to feeding habitats. The difference in the apparent degree of natal homing behaviour among the different life-history stages of hawksbill turtles at Mona Island underscores the complexity of the species' life-history dynamics and highlights the need for both local and regional conservation efforts. © 2008 The Authors.","Background: Millions of people are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease in Latin America. Anti-trypanosomal drug therapy can cure infected individuals, but treatment efficacy is highest early in infection. Vector control campaigns disrupt transmission of T. cruzi, but without timely diagnosis, children infected prior to vector control often miss the window of opportunity for effective chemotherapy. Methods and Findings: We performed a serological survey in children 2-18 years old living in a peri-urban community of Arequipa, Peru, and linked the results to entomological, spatial and census data gathered during a vector control campaign. 23 of 433 (5.3% [95% Cl 3.4-7.9]) children were confirmed seropositive for T. cruzi infection by two methods. Spatial analysis revealed that households with infected children were very tightly clustered within looser clusters of households with parasite-infected vectors. Bayesian hierarchical mixed models, which controlled for clustering of infection, showed that a child's risk of being seropositive increased by 20% per year of age and 4% per vector captured within the child's house. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plots of best-fit models suggest that more than 83% of infected children could be identified while testing only 22% of eligible children. Conclusions: We found evidence of spatially-focal vector-borne T. cruzi transmission in peri-urban Arequipa. Ongoing vector control campaigns, in addition to preventing further parasite transmission, facilitate the collection of data essential to identifying children at high risk of T. cruzi infection. Targeted screening strategies could make integration of diagnosis and treatment of children into Chagas disease control programs feasible in lower-resource settings.","Aim: Comparison of Epipedobates bassleri (Myers, 1987), which occurs on high-altitude mountain ridges ('sky peninsulas') in the Andean transition zone and demonstrates high levels of divergence in colouration among populations, and Epipedobates hahneli (Schulte, 1999), which occurs throughout the lowland regions of the Amazon basin and is morphologically conserved, using phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial sequence data and comparison of colour pattern. Location: Central cordilleras of Peru (near Tarapoto, San Martin). Methods: DNA was extracted from individuals of E. bassleri from the central cordilleras of Peru, and from individuals of E. hahneli from across Peru. The cytochrome b mitochondrial gene region was amplified and sequenced for individuals of each species, and phylogenetic analysis was carried out using Bayesian inference. Genetic distances among populations and geographic distances of each species were examined and compared using Mantel tests. Parametric bootstrapping was used to test the monophyly of E. bassleri. Results: Epipedobates bassleri formed a well-supported monophyletic group and showed higher levels of genetic divergence among populations than was shown among populations of E. hahneli from the same region. Distinct clades representing different geographic regions were recovered for E. hahneli. Levels of divergence among more geographically distant populations of E. hahneli were higher than levels of divergence among E. bassleri populations. We found a significant correlation between genetic divergence and geographic distance as measured along a 1000-m contour line, but not as measured by direct routes (crossing putative biogeographical barriers). Main conclusions: Levels of genetic divergence were higher among populations of morphologically conservative E. hahneli than among populations of morphologically variable E. bassleri, suggesting rapid divergence in colouration among populations of E. bassleri. These patterns support previous arguments concerning the role of the montane transition zone between the high mountains and lowlands in divergence and speciation. High levels of both genetic and phenotypic divergence among populations of E. bassleri indicate that ecological or behavioural factors may be responsible for the high levels of colour variation seen among E. bassleri, but not among E. hahnleli, populations. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","In this article, it is proposed a model of recovery of information from a database through queries in Natural Language using the voice as input vector. This model incorporates a Hybrid Intelligent System based on Genetic Algorithms and a Self-Organizing Map of Kohonen (SOM) to recognize the present phonemes in a word through time, which allows us to remake up a word with speaker independence. Besides, it is proposed the use of a compiler with grammar of type 2 according to the Chomsky Hierarchy to support the syntactic and semantic structure in Spanish language. Our experiments suggest that the voice and Natural Language improve notably the Human-Computer interaction regarding with traditional methods, also that it is possible to achieve a more exact recognition of words by using neural networks SOM regarding to previous approaches as Hidden Markov Models (HMM). © 2006 IEEE.","We introduce a new skew-probit link for item response theory (IRT) by considering an accumulated skew-normal distribution. The model extends the symmetric probitnormal IRT model by considering a new item (or skewness) parameter for the item characteristic curve. A special interpretation is given for this parameter, and a latent linear structure is indicated for the model when an augmented likelihood is considered. Bayesian MCMC inference approach is developed and an efficiency study in the estimation of the model parameters is undertaken for a data set from (Tanner 1996, pg. 190) by using the notion of effective sample size (ESS) as defined in Kass et al. (1998) and the sample size per second (ESS/s) as considered in Sahu (2002) The methodology is illustrated using a data set corresponding to a Mathematical Test applied in Peruvian schools for which a sensitivity analysis of the chosen priors is conducted and also a comparison with seven parametric IRT models is conducted. The main conclusion is that the skew-probit item response model seems to provide the best fit. © 2006 International Society for Bayesian Analysis.","• Background and Aims: Cocoa (Theobroma cacao) is indigenous to the Amazon region of South America, and it is well known that the Peruvian Amazon harbours a large number of diverse cocoa populations. A small fraction of the diversity has been collected and maintained as an ex-situ germplasm repository in Peru. However, incorrect labelling of accessions and lack of information on genetic diversity have hindered efficient conservation and use of this germplasm. This study targeted assessment of genetic diversity and population structure in a managed and a semi-natural population. • Methods: Using a capillary electrophoresis genotyping system, 105 cocoa accessions collected from the Huallaga and Ucayali valleys of Peru were fingerprinted. Based on 15 loci SSR profiles, genetic identity was examined for each accession and duplicates identified, population structure assessed and genetic diversity analysed in these two populations. • Key Results: Ten synonymous mislabelled groups were identified among the 105 accessions. The germplasm group in the Huallaga valley was clearly separated from the group in Ucayali valley by the Bayesian assignment test. The Huallaga group has lower genetic diversity, both in terms of allelic richness and of gene diversity, than the Ucayali group. Analysis of molecular variance suggested genetic substructure in the Ucayali group. Significant spatial correlation between genetic distance and geographical distances was detected in the Ucayali group by Mantel tests. • Conclusions: These results substantiate the hypothesis that the Peruvian Amazon hosts a high level of cocoa genetic diversity, and the diversity has a spatial structure. The introduction of exotic seed populations into the Peruvian Amazon is changing the cocoa germplasm spectrum in this region. The spatial structure of cocoa diversity recorded here highlights the need for additional collecting and conservation measures for natural and semi-natural cocoa populations. © 2006 The Author(s).","Aperture synthesis radar imaging has been used to investigate coherent backscatter from ionospheric plasma irregularities at Jicamarca and elsewhere for several years. Phenomena of interest include equatorial spread F, 150-km echoes, the equatorial electrojet, range-spread meteor trails, and mesospheric echoes. The sought-after images are related to spaced-receiver data mathematically through an integral transform, but direct inversion is generally impractical or suboptimal. We instead turn to statistical inverse theory, endeavoring to utilize fully all available information in the data inversion. The imaging algorithm used at Jicamarca is based on an implementation of the MaxEnt method developed for radio astronomy. Its strategy is to limit the space of candidate images to those that are positive definite, consistent with data to the degree required by experimental confidence limits; smooth (in some sense); and most representative of the class of possible solutions. The algorithm was improved recently by (1) incorporating the antenna radiation pattern in the prior probability and (2) estimating and including the full error covariance matrix in the constraints. The revised algorithm is evaluated using new 28-baseline electrojet data from Jicamarca.

Our aim is to rationalize the molecular basis of their function by studying their evolution using computational biology techniques. Phylogenetic analysis is of primary importance for classifying cognate orthologs; profile hidden Markov models (HMM) of individual subfamilies discern functionally relevant sites by conservation probability analysis; and 3-dimensional structures display the integral protein in context. The major classifications of calcium-binding proteins, viz. EF-hand, C2 and ANX, exhibit structural diversity in their HMM fingerprints at the subfamily level, with functional consequences for protein conformation, exposure of receptor interaction sites and/or binding to membrane phospholipids. Calmodulin, S100 and annexin families were characterized in Petromyzon marinus (sea lamprey) to document genome duplication and gene creation events during the key evolutionary transition to primitive vertebrates. Novel annexins from diverse organisms revealed calcium-binding domains with accessory structural features that define their unique molecular fingerprints, protein interactivity and functional specificity. These include the first single-domain, bacterial annexin in Cytophaga hutchinsonii, the 21 tetrad annexins from the unicellular protist Giardia intestinalis, an ancestor to land plant annexins from the green alga Ostreococcus lucimarinus, invertebrate octad annexins and a critical polymorphism in human ANXA7. Receptor docking models supported the hypothesis of a potential interaction between annexin and C2 domains as a propitious mechanism for ensuring membrane translocation during signal transduction. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Information on stock structure, however, is urgently needed, as the species suffers from considerable mortality due to local fishery activities throughout its distribution range. Using mitochondrial control region sequences and 11 species-specific microsatellite loci, we assessed the genetic differentiation among 118 stranded, incidentally or directly-caught Burmeister's porpoises from different localities in Peruvian, Chilean, and Argentine waters. F-statistics and Bayesian clustering analyses indicate a major population differentiation along the South American Pacific coast, separating Peruvian from both Chilean and Argentine individuals. Interestingly, this population boundary is consistent with the population structure found in another sympatrically-occurring cetacean species: the dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus). Given that vulnerability to local depletion for South American coastal porpoises and dolphins is probably highest in the Peruvian population (due to high exploitation levels and recurrent El Niño events), the genetic data reported here considerably strengthen the need for conservation efforts focused on regulation of catches in local waters. Moreover, we discuss possible genetic differentiation among Burmeister's porpoises (i) from the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean and (ii) from different Peruvian harbors. Finally, cross-species amplifications suggest that our newly-developed microsatellite markers will be useful in population genetic studies in the five other extant porpoise species. © Springer 2005.","The role of bats as potential sources of transmission to humans or as maintenance hosts of leptospires is poorly understood. We quantified the prevalence of leptospiral colonization in bats in the Peruvian Amazon in the vicinity of Iquitos, an area of high biologic diversity. Of 589 analyzed bats, culture (3 of 589) and molecular evidence (20 of 589) of leptospiral colonization was found in the kidneys, yielding an overall colonization rate of 3.4%. Infection rates differed with habitat and location, and among different bat species. Bayesian analysis was used to infer phylogenic relationships of leptospiral 16S ribosomal DNA sequences. Tree topologies were consistent with groupings based on DNA-DNA hybridization studies. A diverse group of leptospires was found in peri-Iquitos bat populations including Leptospira interrogans (5 clones), L. kirschneri (1), L. borgpetersenii (4), L. fainei (1), and two previously undescribed leptospiral species (8). Although L. kirschenri and L. interrogans have been previously isolated from bats, this report is the first to describe L. borgpetersenii and L. fainei infection of bats. A wild animal reservoir of L. fainei has not been previously described. The detection in bats of the L. interrogans serovar Icterohemorrhagiae, a leptospire typically maintained by peridomestic rats, suggests a rodent-bat infection cycle. Bats in Iquitos maintain a genetically diverse group of leptospires. These results provide a solid basis for pursuing molecular epidemiologic studies of bat-associated Leptospira, a potentially new epidemiologic reservoir of transmission of leptospirosis to humans.

As an initial test, measurements have been made in the troposphere (5-10 km) and in the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) (95-105 km). Even though the EEJ irregularities are aligned with the magnetic field, i.e., only a two-dimensional approach is needed, we decided to make these observations (1) to calibrate our eight-module configuration, and (2) to study the performance of different imaging methods. These two goals are feasible, given the fact that we have a good knowledge of the EEJ's mean position, orientation, and aspect sensitivity. Four different methods have been implemented to solve for the inverse problem, i.e., to get the atmospheric brightness from the visibility samples on the ground. We used Fourier-based, Capon, and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) methods that were originally used in radar astronomy. In addition, we implemented a fitting technique where a brightness distribution, characterized by a number of anisotropic Gaussian blobs, is assumed. From the EEJ results, (1) there is good agreement between Capon and MaxEnt methods, particularly when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high, (2) under low SNR, MaxEnt works better than the other techniques, and (3) our fitting technique using two Gaussian blobs seems to work very well, but it is very sensitive to the initial parameters needed to start the fitting procedure. Finally, the tropospheric images indicate that the troposphere over Jicamarca was too homogeneous and no significant gain in information was attained by using more than three-receiving antennas, particularly when long integration times were used (>2 min). The situation could be different in a troposphere less stable than the one at Jicamarca, where the Peruvian coast temperature inversion and stability are prevalent. In the future, efforts will be made to extend the three-dimensional approach to the tropopause and lower stratosphere, where we expect to get more interesting images. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.
