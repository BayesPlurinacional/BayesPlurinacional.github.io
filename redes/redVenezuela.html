Box 40200, Venezuela","<b>Setting course for a translational pharmacology and a predictive toxicology based on the numerical probability of clinical relevance<\/b><br><br>For a significant share of the chemicals, current bioassays mispredicted the outcomes in the reference methods they simulate. For any drug or chemical, and depending on the regulatory or corporate situation, three different approaches calculate the numerical probability by which agreement (or discrepancy) can be statistically expected between (1) the result of a predictive bioassay, and (2) the outcome on its reference method. If such concordance is expected with enough confidence based on a sufficient percentage probability, then specific results from that bioassay can be considered as correctly predictive.

These countries are characterized by a heterogeneous malaria landscape and malaria hotspots. Furthermore, the political unrest in Venezuela has led to significant cross-border population movement. Hence, the aim of this study was to describe spatial patterns and identify significant climatic drivers of malaria transmission along the Venezuela-Brazil-Guyana border, focusing on Bolivar state, Venezuela and Roraima state, Brazil. Malaria case data, stratified by species from 2016 to 2018, were obtained from the Brazilian Malaria Epidemiology Surveillance Information System, the Guyana Vector Borne Diseases Program, the Venezuelan Ministry of Health, and civil society organizations. Spatial autocorrelation in malaria incidence was explored using Getis-Ord (Gi*) statistics. A Poisson regression model was developed with a conditional autoregressive prior structure and posterior parameters were estimated using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with Gibbs sampling. There were 685,498 malaria cases during the study period. Plasmodium vivax was the predominant species (71.7%, 490,861). Malaria hotspots were located in eight municipalities along the Venezuela and Guyana international borders with Brazil. Plasmodium falciparum increased by 2.6% (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.1%, 2.8%) for one meter increase in altitude, decreased by 1.6% (95% CrI 1.5%, 2.3%) and 0.9% (95% CrI 0.7%, 2.4%) per 1 cm increase in 6-month lagged precipitation and each 1 °C increase of minimum temperature without lag. Each 1 °C increase of 1-month lagged maximum temperature increased P. falciparum by 0.6% (95% CrI 0.4%, 1.9%). P. vivax cases increased by 1.5% (95% CrI 1.3%, 1.6%) for one meter increase in altitude and decreased by 1.1% (95% CrI 1.0%, 1.2%) and 7.3% (95% CrI 6.7%, 9.7%) for each 1 cm increase of precipitation lagged at 6-months and 1 °C increase in minimum temperature lagged at 6-months. Each 1°C increase of two-month lagged maximum temperature increased P. vivax by 1.5% (95% CrI 0.6%, 7.1%). There was no significant residual spatial clustering after accounting for climatic covariates. Malaria hotspots were located along the Venezuela and Guyana international border with Roraima state, Brazil. In addition to population movement, climatic variables were important drivers of malaria transmission in these areas. © 2022, The Author(s).","<b>Upper-lithospheric structure of northeastern Venezuela from joint inversion of surface-wave dispersion and receiver functions<\/b><br><br>We use 1.5 years of continuous recordings from an amphibious seismic network deployment in the region of northeastern South America and the southeastern Caribbean to study the crustal and uppermost mantle structure through a joint inversion of surface-wave dispersion curves determined from ambient seismic noise and receiver functions. The availability of both ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) and land stations makes this experiment ideal to determine the best processing methods to extract reliable empirical Green's functions (EGFs) and construct a 3D shear velocity model. Results show EGFs with high signal-to-noise ratio for land-land, land-OBS and OBS-OBS paths from a variety of stacking methods. Using the EGF estimates, we measure phase and group velocity dispersion curves for Rayleigh and Love waves. We complement these observations with receiver functions, which allow us to perform an H-k analysis to obtain Moho depth estimates across the study area. The measured dispersion curves and receiver functions are used in a Bayesian joint inversion to retrieve a series of 1D shear-wave velocity models, which are then interpolated to build a 3D model of the region. Our results display clear contrasts in the oceanic region across the border of the San Sebastian-El Pilar strike-slip fault system as well as a high-velocity region that corresponds well with the continental craton of southeastern Venezuela. We resolve known geological features in our new model, including the Espino Graben and the Guiana Shield provinces, and provide new information about their crustal structures. Furthermore, we image the difference in the crust beneath the Maturín and Guárico sub-basins.

We propose a Bayesian dynamic estimation of the hedonic regression model in which the estimated coefficients can be time-varying, demonstrated with an application of art prices. Our dynamic linear regression model overcomes the problems associated with traditional rolling-window based OLS (which represent ad hoc approximations to dynamic estimation), such as under or over-estimation of parameter values and non-adaptive window sizes to account for time-variability. Using a sample of 27,124 paintings sold at auction from 63 Pop-artists (2001–2013), we demonstrate that the estimated coefficients associated with commonly used art attributes fluctuate noticeably through time, and that certain types of artworks and artists might be regarded as “safer” investments (as their art experiences smaller maximum drawdowns), based on price dynamics during the financial crisis (2008–09). © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Prediction and Surveillance Sampling Assessment in Plant Nurseries and Fields<\/b><br><br>In this paper, we propose a structured additive regression (STAR) model for modeling the occurrence of a disease in fields or nurseries. The methodological approach involves a Gaussian field (GF) affected by a spatial process represented by an approximation to a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF). This modeling allows the building of maps with prediction probabilities regarding the presence of a disease in plants using Bayesian kriging. The advantage of this modeling is its computational benefit when compared with known spatial hierarchical models and with the Bayesian inference based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Inference through the use of the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) with the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach facilitates the handling of large datasets in excellent computation times. Our approach allows the evaluation of different sampling strategies, from which we obtain inferences and prediction maps with similar behaviour to those obtained when we consider all subjects in the study population. The analysis of the different sampling strategies allows us to recognize the relevance of spatial components in the studied phenomenon. We demonstrate how Bayesian kriging can incorporate sources of uncertainty associated with the prediction parameters, which leads to more realistic and accurate estimation of the uncertainty. We illustrate the methodology with samplings of Citrus macrophylla affected by the tristeza virus (CTV) grown in a nursery. © 2022 by the authors.","<b>Synergies between environmental degradation and climate variation on malaria re-emergence in southern Venezuela: a spatiotemporal modelling study<\/b><br><br>Background: Environmental degradation facilitates the emergence of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, through changes in the ecological landscape that increase human–vector contacts and that expand vector habitats. However, the modifying effects of environmental degradation on climate–disease relationships have not been well explored. Here, we investigate the rapid re-emergence of malaria in a transmission hotspot in southern Venezuela and explore the synergistic effects of environmental degradation, specifically gold-mining activity, and climate variation. Methods: In this spatiotemporal modelling study of the 46 parishes of the state of Bolívar, southeast Venezuela, we used data from the Venezuelan Ministry of Health including population data and monthly cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and Plasmodium vivax malaria between 1996 and 2016. We estimated mean precipitation and temperature using the ERA5-Land dataset and used monthly anomalies in sea-surface temperature as an indicator of El Niño events between 1996 and 2016. The location of suspected mining sites in Bolívar in 2009, 2017, and 2018 were sourced from the Amazon Geo-Referenced Socio-Environmental Information Network. We estimated measures of cumulative forest loss and urban development by km2 using annual land cover maps from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative between 1996 and 2016. We modelled monthly cases of P falciparum and P vivax malaria using a Bayesian hierarchical mixed model framework. We quantified the variation explained by mining activity before exploring the modifying effects of environmental degradation on climate–malaria relationships. Findings: We observed a 27% reduction in the additional unexplained spatial variation in incidence of P falciparum malaria and a 23% reduction in P vivax malaria when mining was included in our models. The effect of temperature on malaria was greater in high mining areas than low mining areas, and the P falciparum malaria effect size at temperatures of 26·5°C (2·4 cases per 1000 people [95% CI 1·78–3·06]) was twice as high as the effect in low mining areas (1 case per 1000 people [0·68–1·49]). Interpretation: We show that mining activity in southern Venezuela is associated with hotspots of malaria transmission. Increased temperatures exacerbated malaria transmission in mining areas, highlighting the need to consider how environmental degradation modulates climate effect on disease risk, which is especially important in areas subjected to rapidly rising temperatures and land-use change globally. Our findings have implications for the progress towards malaria elimination in the Latin American region. Our findings are also important for effectively targeting timely treatment programmes and vector-control activities in mining areas with high rates of malaria transmission.

A study of the effects of perceived ethical behavior of brands in Colombia during the initial months of the COVID-19 outbreak was conducted in May 2020 in Bogota, Colombia, to ascertain customer perception of brand ethical actions during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 outbreak. A Bayesian model was developed to assess the impact of brands' ethical behavior on brand recognition benefits, brand image, and brand commitment. The selection of the initial months of the outbreak for this project was important because the COVID-19 pandemic had the potential to augment consumer perception of brands' ethical actions at a pivotal moment in consumers' lives. Our findings demonstrate that customers expressed a positive perception of brands' ethical actions during the early months of the pandemic, which resulted in high commitment intention to these brands in the model examined. The findings highlight the critical nature of the perception of ethical behavior in the eyes of customers during a major global health crisis. More than ever, organizations must commit their brands to fully live out their publicly expressed ethical principles and continuously monitor consumer perceptions of brand attributes and behaviors associated with ethical actions regardless of market conditions. Commitment to living the brand's stated ethical principles can be demonstrated via branding activities in ways that can be especially welcomed by customers during turbulent times. The insights mentioned in this article are crucial for brands already present in South America or exploring expansion into these regions. The findings provide compelling evidence of the impact of ethical actions on consumer commitment to brands, suggesting that brands must now, more than ever, stay in touch with their customers and truthfully live the ethical values they transmit to customers. © 2022, The Author(s).","<b>GENETIC DIVERSITY OF Aedes aegypti IN THE CENTRAL-UPPER PARANÁ CROSS-BORDER AXIS IN PARAGUAY<\/b><br><br>Objective: To determine the genetic diversity of Aedes aegypti in the Central-Alto Paraná cross-border road corridor of Paraguay, an area that has reports of dengue cases. Materials and methods: Twenty adult females were selected from hatching Ae. aegypti eggs from households geolocated in the departments of Alto Paraná, Caaguazú, Cordillera and Central, between 2018 and 2019. DNA was extracted from the tissue of females for amplifying their polymorphic patterns by random amplification of polymorphic DNA by PCR (RAPD-PCR), using primers H3 and B03 in order to identify genetic parame-ters of population diversity. The relationships between mosquito populations according to locality were observed by unpaired arithmetic mean analysis. We used DIVA-GIS 7.3.0 and MAXENT to analyze the suitable areas of actual and potential geographic distribution of these Ae. aegypti populations. Results: Forty loci were identified by RAPD-PCR profiling, with moderate gene differentiation (Gst = 0.12). The cross-border corridor presented bioclimatic conditions for the presence of variant populations of Ae. aegypti, with precipitation in the warmest quarter and mean temperature in the driest quarter being determinant in the distribution. Conclusions: There is evidence of moderate genetic diversity in Ae. aegypti populations from areas that have reported dengue cases in the cross-border road corridor linking the Central and Alto Paraná departments of Paraguay. The study of genetic variability of Ae. aegypti is very useful for entomo-epidemiological surveillance and evaluation of possible resistance to chemical control. © 2022, Instituto Nacional de Salud.

We evaluated the potential role of the uplift of the Eastern Cordillera (EC) of the Colombian Andes and the Mérida Andes (MA) of Venezuela as drivers of vicariance between lowland populations co-distributed on both flanks. We synthesized published geological data and provided a new reconstruction showing that the EC-MA grew from north to south, reaching significant heights and separating drainages and changing sediment composition by 38–33 million years ago (Ma). A few lowland passes across the EC-MA may have reached their current heights (~1,900 m a.s.l.) at 3–5 Ma. We created a comparative phylogeographic data set for 37 lineages of lowland tetrapods. Based on molecular phylogenetic analyses, most divergences between sister populations or species across the EC-MA occurred during Pliocene and the Quaternary and a few during the latest Miocene, and coalescent simulations rejected synchronous divergence for most groups. Divergence times were on average slightly but significantly more recent in homeotherms relative to poikilotherms. Because divergence ages are mostly too recent relative to the geological history and too asynchronous relative to each other, divergence across the northern Andes may be better explained by organism-environment interactions concomitant with climate oscillations during the Pleistocene, and/or dispersal across portals through the Andes.

Recently, we observed higher semantic similarity in first-episode-schizophrenia (FES) patients. In this study, we investigate if this aberrant similarity relates to the ‘causal’ connectivity between two key nodes of the word production system: inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the semantic-hub at the ventral anterior temporal lobe (vATL). Methods: Resting-state fMRI scans were collected from 60 participants (30 untreated FES and 30 healthy controls). The semantic distance was measured with the CoVec semantic tool based on GloVe. A spectral dynamic causal model with Parametrical Empirical Bayes was constructed modelling the intrinsic self-inhibitory and extrinsic-excitatory connections within the brain regions. We estimated the parameters of a fully connected model with the semantic distance as a covariate. Results: FES patients chose words with higher semantic similarity when describing the pictures compared to the HC group. Among patients, an increased semantic similarity was related with an increase in intrinsic connections within both the vATL and IFG, suggesting that reduced ‘synaptic gain’ in these regions likely contribute to aberrant sampling of the semantic space during discourse in schizophrenia. Conclusions: Lexical impoverishment relates to increased self-inhibition in both the IFG and vATL. The associated reduction in synaptic gain may relate to reduced precision of locally generated neural activity, forcing the choice of words that are already ‘activated’ in a lexical network. One approach to improve word sampling may be via promoting synaptic gain via supra-physiological stimulation within the Broca's-vATL network; this proposal needs verification. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Epidemic Models and Estimation of the Spread of SARS-CoV-2: Case Study Portoviejo-Ecuador<\/b><br><br>The mathematical models can help to characterize, quantify, summarize, and determine the severity of the outbreak of the Coronavirus, the estimation of the dynamics of the pandemic helps to identify the type of measures and interventions that can be taken to minimize the impact by classified information. In this work, we propose four epidemiological models to study the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, two versions of the SIR model (Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered) are considered, the classical Crank-Nicolson method is used with a stochastic version of the Beta-Dirichlet state-space models. Subsequently, the SEIR model (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered) is fitted, the Euler method and a stochastic version of the Beta-Dirichlet state-space model are used. In the results of this study (Portoviejo-Ecuador), the SIR model with the Beta-Dirichlet state-space form determines the maximum point of infection in less time than the SIR model with the Crank-Nicolson method. Furthermore, the maximum point of infection is shown by the SEIR model, that is reached during the first two weeks where the virus begins to spread, more efficient is shown by this model. To measure the quality of the estimation of the algorithms, we use three measures of goodness of fit. The estimated errors are negligible for the analyzed data. Finally, the evolution of the spread is predicted, that can be helpful to prevent the capacity of the country’s health system. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>Hierarchical Bayesian classification methods to identify topics by journal quartile with an application in biological sciences<\/b><br><br>This manuscript builds on a novel, automatic, freely-available Bayesian approach to extract information in abstracts and titles to classify research topics by quartile. This approach is demonstrated for all N= 149,129 ISI-indexed publications in biological sciences journals during 2017. A Bayesian multinomial inverse regression approach is used to extract rankings of topics without the need of a pre-defined dictionary. Bigrams are used for extraction of research topics across manuscripts, and rankings of research topics are constructed by quartile. Worldwide and local results (e.g., comparison between two peer/aspirational research institutions in Colombia) are provided, and differences are explored both at the global and local levels. Some topics persist across quartiles, while the relevance of others is quartile-specific. Challenges in sustainable development appear as more prevalent in top quartile journals across institutions, while the two Colombian institutions favour plant and microorganism research. This approach can reduce information inequities, by allowing young/incipient researchers in biological sciences, especially within lower income countries or universities with limited resources, to freely assess the state of the literature and the relative likelihood of publication in higher impact journals by research topic. This can also serve institutions of higher education to identify missing research topics and areas of competitive advantage. © 2022-IOS Press.

This work proposes the combination of a multi-label classifier, Circular Classifier Chain (CCC), with a multimodal classifier, Fusion using a Semi-Naive Bayesian classifier (FSNBC), to include explicitly the dependencies between multiple affective states during the automatic recognition process. This combination of classifiers is applied to a virtual rehabilitation context of post-stroke patients. We collected data from post-stroke patients, which include finger pressure, hand movements, and facial expressions during ten longitudinal sessions. Videos of the sessions were labelled by clinicians to recognize four states: tiredness, anxiety, pain, and engagement. Each state was modelled by the FSNBC receiving the information of finger pressure, hand movements, and facial expressions. The four FSNBCs were linked in the CCC to exploit the dependency relationships between the states. The convergence of CCC was reached by 5 iterations at most for all the patients. Results (ROC AUC) of CCC with the FSNBC are over 0.940±0.045 (±std.deviation) for the four states. Relationships of mutual exclusion between engagement and all the other states and co-occurrences between pain and anxiety were detected and discussed. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","<b>Development of microsatellite markers and evaluation of genetic diversity of the Amazonian ornamental fish Pterophyllum scalare<\/b><br><br>The objective of the present work was to develop species-specific microsatellite markers for P. scalare and to analyze the diversity and genetic structure of a wild population, from the Amazon River, and three commercial stocks (common, marble, and clown morphological variants), from farmers in Vieras-Minas Gerais. Through microsatellite-enriched genetic libraries, 11 microsatellite markers with adequate amplification patterns were characterized. Population genetic analysis identified eight polymorphic loci that generated 66 alleles ranging from two alleles (PSCA1B3) to nine (PSCA2H1). The polymorphic information content ranged from 0.031 to 0.827. High genetic differentiation was observed between the wild population and the stocks, and moderate differentiation between the three stocks. Deviation in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed in one locus in the wild population, in five loci in the common morphological variant, in two in the marble, and in two in the clown morphological variant. Bayesian analysis of genetic structure revealed the existence of two clusters, one represented by the natural population and the other by the stocks. The developed microsatellite markers serve as a tool for the analysis of diversity and genetic structure and conservation studies of P. scalare. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>Applying Bayesian forecasting to predictive toxicology: The probability of innate carcinogenicity to humans of colorants synthesized from benzidine<\/b><br><br>The preclinical identification of health hazards relies on the performance (the historic concordance to the respective gold standard) of regulatorily recommended bioassays. However, any testing with less than 100% sensitivity (or 100% specificity) can deliver false results (outcomes discordant to the respective gold standard). Conversely, the predictive values approach (a.k.a. Bayesian forecasting) weighs (1) the performance of the predictive bioassay (battery, or framework) with (2) the prevalence of -positivity to the respective gold standard- in the most representative category to which the test substance can be allocated. Thus, the predictive values approach (PVA) provides the numeric probability for the toxicity to humans of chemicals that, circumstantially, are evaluable only through nonclinical data. Consequently, the PVA improves the predictivity of nonclinical toxicology, and increases the impact of hazard identifications entirely based on preclinical data. This article aimed to introduce the PVA through a worked example. Due to their toxicological homogeneity and public health relevance, the superfamily of colorants synthesized from benzidine (BZ) or some mutagenic congeners was selected (colorings hereafter mentioned as BZ-related-colorants). Through the PVA, the numeric probability of innate carcinogenicity to humans of 259 BZ-related-colorants was either estimated from rodent carcinogenesis bioassays (RCBs) or predicted from methods alternative to the RCB. A discussion was provided on (1) some limitations and implications of the PVA, and (2) the probable significance of the predictive values figured here for 259 BZ-related-colorings. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Star cluster survival in dark matter haloes: An old cluster in Eridanus II?<\/b><br><br>The star formation history and the internal dynamics of Milky Way satellite galaxies are often complicated. In the last years, a substantial fraction of the known faint dwarf satellites have been studied. Some of them show embedded stellar substructures, such as star clusters and even globular star clusters. In this work, we study Eridanus II, a dwarf spheroidal satellite that hosts a star cluster, using published and archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys. We employ a Bayesian hierarchical method to infer the star formation history of Eridanus II. We find that the bulk of the stars in Eridanus II are very old ($13.5_{-1}^{+0.5}$ Gyr) and quite metal-poor (Z = 0.000 01). We do not find any evidence of the presence of an intermediate age or young population in Eri II. We cannot date the embedded star cluster as a separate entity, but we find it likely that the cluster has a similar age and metallicity as the bulk of the stars in Eri II. The existence of an old star cluster in a dark matter dominated old metal-poor dwarf galaxy is of major importance to cast light on the dark matter distribution within dwarf galaxies. The existence of intermediate age stars is required by the recent detection of carbon stars in Eri II. Since no recent star formation is detected, blue-straggler fusions of lower mass stars are the most likely origin of the carbon star progenitors. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.","<b>Hidden Markov model-based heartbeat detector using electrocardiogram and arterial pressure signals<\/b><br><br>The automatic detection of a heartbeat is commonly performed by detecting the QRS complex in the electrocardiogram (ECG), however, various noise sources and missing data can jeopardize the reliability of the ECG. Therefore, there is a growing interest in combining the information from many physiological signals to accurately detect heartbeats. To this end, hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used in this work to jointly exploit the information from ECG, arterial blood pressure (ABP) and pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) signals in order to conceive a heartbeat detector. After preprocessing the physiological signals, a sliding window is used to extract an observation sequence to be passed through two HMMs (previously trained on a training dataset) in order to obtain the log-likelihoods of observation and signals a detection if the difference of log-likelihoods exceeds an adaptive threshold. Several HMM-based heartbeat detectors were conceived to exploit the information from the ECG, ABP and PAP signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2014, and MGH/MF Waveform databases. A grid search methodology was used to optimize the duration of the observation sequence and a multiplicative factor to form the adaptive threshold. Using the optimal parameters found on a training database through 10-fold cross-validation, sensitivity and positive predictivity above 99% were obtained on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2014 databases, while they are above 95% in the MGH/MF waveform database using ECG and ABP signals. Our detector approach showed detection performances comparable with the literature in the three databases. © 2021, Korean Society of Medical and Biological Engineering.","<b>The 2-year rodent bioassay in drug and chemical carcinogenicity testing: Performance, utility, and configuration for cancer hazard identification<\/b><br><br>For several intended uses of chemicals, the 2-year rodent bioassay (RCB) has been the benchmark method to screen the carcinogenicity to humans of substances, according to the hazard identification sphere. Despite the ongoing controversy around this traditional testing, the RCB is in force and being used by stakeholders. After assembling the RCB's ability to forecast the carcinogenicity to humans of substances, the current review aimed to provide a discussion on the RCB's (1) sensitivity and specificity; (2) utility; (3) configuration, and (4) provisional role in the regulatory policy. In general, RCBs conducted at maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) exhibited a functional ability to (1) not missing the great majority of human carcinogens, and to (2) not responding to the large majority of human non-carcinogens. There is citable evidence supporting the use of MTDs to render RCBs as sensitive as possible, particularly provided the ethically-justified small samples used in RCBs. The literature shows that rodent-specific mechanisms of chemical carcinogenesis contribute significant unspecificity to RCBs. Nonetheless, the paradox between a functional sensitivity and a significant unspecificity can be predictively resolved through the application of Bayesian forecasting. In terms of performance to forecast the carcinogenicity to humans of either genotoxic or non-genotoxic substances, 2-species-RCBs added no value over the rat-RCB. Nevertheless, there is preliminary evidence cautioning that 15% of the rodent carcinogens probably carcinogenic to humans could be missed if mouse-RCBs are indiscriminately discontinued. More than thirteen RCB-related issues relevant to regulatory pharmacology and toxicology were discussed and summarized in this review. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","<b>What makes a tweet be retweeted? A Bayesian trigram analysis of tweet propagation during the 2015 Colombian political campaign<\/b><br><br>This article proposes the use of computationally efficient inverse regression Bayesian method for analysis of tweet propagation of political messages. Our example focuses on the Colombian case, though our method can be used in any election where social media messaging has a direct impact on political outcomes. We find strong evidence that politicians were able to identify the combination of sensitive words to enhance the probability of retweet of the message, which, in turn, had an impact on political outcomes. The contributions of our work entail: (a) an examination of a neglected unit of analysis (trigram) in a language less studied (i.e. Spanish), (b) based on an innovative Bayesian efficient approach and (c) exploiting the predictive power that retweets have on electoral results as an informational diffusion tool in social media. A practical implication of this new methodology is the possibility to adjust political messages as a means to increase voters engagement in political campaigns. © The Author(s) 2019.","<b>Crustal and upper-mantle structure of the Eastern Caribbean and Northern Venezuela from passive Rayleigh wave tomography<\/b><br><br>We explore the shear-wave lithospheric velocity structure of the Eastern Caribbean and Northern Venezuela using ambient noise tomography with stations deployed around the study area. We construct cross-correlation functions from continuous seismic records, and measure phase velocities of fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves. These velocities are further projected onto 0.6°x0.6° phase velocity grids for each period between 5 s and 50 s. The pseudo-dispersion curve at each grid point is inverted for 1D shear velocity profiles by using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme. The interpolated 3D velocity model shows that the mean shear velocity of the Eastern Caribbean lithospheric mantle is lower than the global average, which is in agreement with values reported in other large igneous provinces. We interpret that low velocities in the lithospheric keel are associated with an anomalous composition and/or an elevated thermal state; this gives the Caribbean plate a high buoyancy that determines the subduction polarities in the region. The results also indicate that: (a) the mantle beneath Northern Venezuela retains compositional anomalies related to extension processes of different ages; (b) the overriding of the Caribbean plate by the Great Antilles arc seems to be much slower than previously suggested; and (c) the localized volcanism in the center of the Lesser Antilles arc is related to asthenospheric flow through the tear induced on the subducted slab by major strike-slip faults. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Insights into the importance of areas of climatic stability in the evolution and maintenance of avian diversity in the Mesoamerican dry forests<\/b><br><br>We analysed the phylogeographic structure of five resident bird lineages distributed in the seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) of Mesoamerica to test whether they show patterns of synchronous and geographically coincident genetic divergence during the Quaternary. We generated phylogenetic trees, estimated divergence times and analysed the genetic structure of populations (based on sequences of mitochondrial genes), as well as estimating historical distributions (range extension and areas of long-term climate stability) during the Late Pleistocene. We tested and selected the phylogeographic divergence scenarios that best explain the current divergence patterns of taxa using the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach. For most species, phylogenetic trees and haplotype networks showed a clear genetic structure associated with geographical distribution. Overall, the divergence times ranged from 0.29-2.0 Mya, suggesting that diversification of populations occurred at different times during the Pleistocene. The palaeodistribution models predicted at least two areas of climatic stability within the current SDTF that probably allowed glacial-interglacial persistence of isolated bird populations along the Mexican Pacific, thus promoting their genetic divergence. The results provide information relevant to the identification of diversification hotspots for the Mesoamerican SDTF avifauna. © 2021 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.","<b>Geographical distribution and ecological niche modeling of the etiological agents of human sporotrichosis in Venezuela<\/b><br><br>The geographical distribution and ecological niche of the two circulating species of the Sporothrix genus in Venezuela was established. For this, 68 isolates of Sporothrix spp. from patients of different regions of the country were analyzed. A molecular taxonomy analysis was conducted using a fragment of the calmodulin gene (CAL), and ITS regions, confirming the presence of S. schenckii (62%) and S. globosa (38%). Computational models of ecological niche for each species were obtained by the maximum entropy method using the MaxEnt software, which predicted the best environmental conditions for the presence of the two species. These models predict that the main variables influencing the presence of S. schenckii were altitude and annual mean temperature, while for S. globosa, the more influent variable was the land use, with 82% of S. globosa located at urban areas vs 56% for S. schenckii. The results here presented could contribute to understand the specific environmental factors that might modulate the occurrence of Sporothrix spp. as well as its transmission.

Information on the geographic and genetic origin of these stocks is important to guide actions that allow correct management in captivity and, when lost, harm production and genetic conservation. In this sense, the objective of this study was to evaluate the genetic diversity and origin of two breeding stocks of matrinxã, Brycon amazonicus (INPA, Amazonas - INPA and Nova Motum, Mato Grosso - NM). A total of 68 caudal fin samples were collected, including 33 INPA samples and 35 NM samples. Twenty pairs of microsatellite primers were tested, but only seven primers showed satisfactory amplification, amplifying 41 alleles ranging from 187-318 bp. The polymorphic information content ranged from 0.135 (Borg25) to 0.782 (Bh6). Exclusive alleles were observed for both populations (INPA: 04 and NM: 18). Allelic richness results revealed that there was increased loss of genetic variation in NM, indicating a lower evolutionary potential of this stock. The average values of the observed heterozygosity corroborated this statement; however, there were high values for INPA (0.545) and NM (0.475), signifying an adequate genetic variability. An imbalance was found in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the Borg59 locus in INPA (P < 0.05), possibly due to the effect of null alleles, but was attributed to a founder effect. For NM, an imbalance in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed at loci BoM13 and Bh6, which together with the results of the mean inbreeding coefficient values demonstrated the presence of genetic drift. The analysis of molecular variance showed greater variation within populations than between them, and was confirmed by the genetic differentiation value (0.086 - moderate genetic differentiation) and by the distance and genetic identity values (0.273 and 0.761, respectively). Bayesian analysis designated a value of K = 2, with the presence of structuring for NM and INPA; however, with correlated allelic frequencies, confirming a common origin. This origin was corroborated by the presence of gene flow through the number of migrants (5.691). Based on these results, there was a moderate genetic variability for INPA and NM and their common origin was confirmed. Recommendations are also included to minimize the probability of inbreeding processes or genetic drift in the studied stocks.. © 2021 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

The history of the Milky Way galaxy is written in stone in this data set. Parallaxes and photometry tell us where the stars are today, when were they formed, and with what chemical content, that is, their star formation history (SFH). We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model suited to reconstruct the SFH of a resolved stellar population. We study the stars brighter than $G\\, =\\, 15$ within 100 pc of the Sun in Gaia DR2 and derive an SFH of the solar neighbourhood in agreement with previous determinations and improving upon them because we detect chemical enrichment. Our results show a maximum of star formation activity about 10 Gyr ago, producing large numbers of stars with slightly below solar metallicity (Z = 0.014), followed by a decrease in star formation up to a minimum level occurring around 8 Gyr ago. After a quiet period, star formation rises to a maximum at about 5 Gyr ago, forming stars of solar metallicity (Z = 0.017). Finally, star formation has been decreasing until the present, forming stars of Z = 0.03 at a residual level. We test the effects introduced in the inferred SFH by ignoring the presence of unresolved binary stars in the sample, reducing the apparent limiting magnitude, and modifying the stellar initial mass function. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.","<b>Seasonal variation in basal resources supporting fish biomass in longitudinal zones of the Usumacinta River Basin, southern Mexico<\/b><br><br>Aquatic food webs in tropical rivers are affected by spatial and temporal variations in basal resources and the composition of consumer assemblages. We used stable isotope analysis to estimate seasonal variation in basal resources supporting fish biomass in zones along the longitudinal gradient of the Usumacinta River Basin, the largest of Mesoamerica. A Bayesian isotope mixing model was used to estimate the proportional contributions of six basal resources: seston, filamentous algae, periphyton, aquatic macrophytes, riparian C3 plants and C4 plants. Models estimated that fish in the upper zone were largely supported by periphyton and riparian C3 plants during the dry season and by filamentous algae during the wet season. In the dry season, fishes in the middle and lower zones assimilated material derived from seston and, to a lesser extent, periphyton, whereas aquatic macrophytes were more important during the wet season. Chlorophyll-a measurements from the middle and lower zones suggested that seston contained large fractions of suspended algae. These patterns are consistent with the river wave concept, which predicts flow-associated changes in contributions of basal resources to the aquatic food web. The findings of this study reinforce the major role of flow regime in the ecological dynamics of rivers and how these dynamics vary depending on location and local conditions within fluvial networks. © 2021 CSIRO.","<b>Estimation of the State Space Models: An Application in Macroeconomic Series of Ecuador<\/b><br><br>This paper develops a framework for the analysis of state-space models combined with Kalman and smoothed Kalman filters for the estimation of unknown states, and parameters, determining the accuracy of the algorithms, with the purpose of analyzing some time series of the macroeconomy of Ecuador. This methodology plays an important role in the area of economics and finance and has many advantages because it allows describing how observed macroeconomic variables can be related to potentially unobserved state variables, determining the evolution in real time, estimating unobserved trends, changes of structures and make forecasts in future times. To achieve the objectives, three models are proposed: the first model is used to estimate the Ecuador’s gross domestic product. The second model combines a state space model with the classic ARIMA (p, q, r) model to adjust the GDP rate and finally it is considered a model for the simultaneous stress time series analysis related to: consumer price index, industrial production index and active interest rate. In all the cases studied, the estimates obtained reflect the real behavior of the Ecuadorian economy. The square root of the mean square error was used as a measure of goodness of fit to measure the quality of estimation of the algorithms, obtaining small errors. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>Sequential Monte Carlo Filters with Parameters Learning for Commodity Pricing Models<\/b><br><br>In this article, an estimation methodology based on the sequential Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed, that jointly estimate the states and parameters, the relationship between the prices of futures contracts and the spot prices of primary products is determined, the evolution of prices and the volatility of the historical data of the primary market (Gold and Soybean) are analyzed. Two stochastic models for an estimate the states and parameters are considered, the parameters and states describe physical measure (associated with the price) and risk-neutral measure (associated with the markets to futures), the price dynamics in the short-term through the reversion to the mean and volatility are determined, while that in the long term through markets to futures. Other characteristics such as seasonal patterns, price spikes, marketdependent volatilities, and non-seasonality can also be observed. In the methodology, a parameter learning algorithm is used, specifically, three algorithms are proposed, that is the sequential Monte Carlo estimation (SMC) for state space models with unknown parameters: the first method is considered a particle filter that is based on the sampling algorithm of sequential importance with resampling (SISR). The second implemented method is the Storvik algorithm [19], the states and parameters of the posterior distribution are estimated that have supported in low-dimensional spaces, a sufficient statistics from the sample of the filtered distribution is considered. The third method is (PLS) Carvalho's Particle Learning and Smoothing algorithm [31]. The cash prices of the contracts with future delivery dates are analyzed. The results indicate postponement of payment, the future prices on different maturity dates with the spot price are highly correlated. Likewise, the contracts with a delivery date for the last periods of the year 2017, the spot price lower than the prices of the contracts with expiration date for 12 and 24 months is found, opposite occurs in the contracts with expiration date for 1 and 6 months. © 2021 International Academic Press.

In this article, we consider two motion models for a civilian aircraft: a constant velocity model and a coordinated turn model. Both kinematics models are written in state-space terms, where the velocity perturbations are modeled by a white noise acceleration model. In order to estimate the aircraft states given noisy measurements obtained from sensor outputs, we follow a Bayesian statistical approach that calculates the estimators of the unknown states. In our simulation, we recreate an air traffic control scenario and implement two nonlinear filtering algorithms in order to perform target tracking of the aircraft. The nonlinear Bayesian-based filters for this target tracking problem are the unscented Kalman filter and the Gauss-Hermite Kalman filter. Finally, the performance of both nonlinear filters is evaluated with a performance metric, root mean squared error, in Monte-Carlo runs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>Assessment of Research Topic Prevalence by Journal Impact Quartile in Oral Health Sciences Using Bayesian Methods<\/b><br><br>The relationship between research topics and academic prestige of journals is of relevance to assess venues for current research as well as trending areas of new research. This is of special relevance for those developing a research agenda or with defined productivity outcome expectations. This manuscript extracts prevalent topics using titles and abstracts from more than 10,000 manuscripts, constituting all published research in International Scientific Indexing (ISI) journals within the oral health specialties of oral surgery, orthodontics, and periodontics during 2018. Journals are clustered across four quartile categories according to their impact factors. The novelty of our work includes (a) an examination of a neglected unit of analysis (bigram) in oral health sciences which is of higher relevance than single-word topic definitions and (b) the use of an efficient Bayesian hierarchical approach to extract and rank topics across quartiles with information borrowing. Some topics persisted across quartile groups, while others show higher prevalence in specific quartiles, indicating that topics may find some journal quartiles a more appropriate venue for publication. All quartile groups show a prevalence of empirical research. The approach described in this manuscript offers the possibility to adjust/generate research agendas based on research topic prevalence and dynamics. This methodology is relevant for researchers looking to define their research agendas with potential outcomes aligned with the expectations of quantity and quartile set by their home institutions. It also serves researchers to assess most likely quartiles for publication of their work. © The Author(s) 2021.","<b>Genetic diversity based on aflp markers in germplasm of the brazilian national coffea arabica trial<\/b><br><br>Brazil is the world largest producer and exporter of Coffea arabica. In this country, numerous breeding programs have generated a great multiplicity of cultivars with expressive productivity that are adapted to the different regions. Evaluating genetic diversity is critical since it provides parameters for defining breeding strategies. We estimated the genetic diversity among and within 32 cultivars of the Brazilian Coffee Trial using AFLP markers. This trial is composed of the main cultivars developed and some under development by Empresa De Pesquisa Agropecuaria do Estado de Minas Gerais (EPAMIG), Fundação PROCAFÉ, Instituto Agronômico de Campinas (IAC), and Instituto de Desenvolvimento Rural do Paraná (IDR-Paraná). A total of 982 AFLP fragments were generated, of which 97.35% were polymorphic. The percentage of polymorphic loci ranged from 22.8 to 50.5%, with genetic diversity varying from 0.06 to 0.16. Variable levels of genetic diversity observed among cultivars probably derived from the diverse germplasm sources and methods used in the genetic breeding programs, the number of advanced generations of each cultivar, as well as genetic recombination or cross-fertilization during breeding programs. Bayesian cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and Neighbor-Net showed three divergent genetic groups, with a high genetic differentiation index (FST = 0.46). The pairwise FST also revealed high divergence among cultivars. IDR-Paraná had the cultivars with the highest genetic variability among these four Brazilian coffee breeding centers. We found that AFLP markers allowed us to distinguish the cultivars/progenies in the Brazilian National Trial. We conclude that Brazilian coffee germplasm still has considerable genetic variability for the development of new cultivars with high productivity, resistance to disease, superior beverage quality, and adaptation to diverse edaphoclimatic conditions in the different producing regions. © FUNPEC-RP.","<b>Comparative analysis of lattice-based all-pass filter and second order generalized integrator as orthogonal system generator of a pll<\/b><br><br>This paper presents a steady-state comparison of two methods that generate an orthogonal voltage system for a single-phase Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) structure: a widely accepted one based on a Second Order Generalized Integrator (SOGI) and a new one based on a All-Pass Filter (APF) with Lattice structure. Both methods are very attractive because of their simple digital implementation, low computational load and good performance under harmonically distorted grid conditions and variable frequency, so they are a good alternative to other known methods. The paper derives and analyzes the full state space models of the two methods. It is shown that these two methods are equivalent in the most common operation conditions of distributed energy resources, although the APF structure is clearly better than the SOGI one because it maintains its orthogonal generation ability for any higher notch frequencies and any lower sampling frequencies. The comparative analysis were validated by simulation using MATLAB=Simulink and experimental results using a fixed-point DSP. © 2021 ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING.","<b>Blending emotions and cross-modality in sonic seasoning: Towards greater applicability in the design of multisensory food experiences<\/b><br><br>Sonic seasoning refers to the way in which music can influence multisensory tasting experiences. To date, the majority of the research on sonic seasoning has been conducted in Europe or the USA, typically in a within-participants experimental context. In the present study, we assessed the applicability of sonic seasoning in a large-scale between-participants setting in Asia. A sample of 1611 participants tasted one sample of chocolate while listening to a song that evoked a specific combination of cross-modal and emotional consequences. The results revealed that the music’s emotional character had a more prominent effect than its cross-modally corresponding attributes on the multisensory tasting experience. Participants expressed a higher buying intention for the chocolate and rated it as having a softer texture when listening to mainly positive (as compared to mainly negative) music. The chocolates were rated as having a more intense flavor amongst those participants listening to ‘softer’ as compared to ‘harder’ music. Therefore, the present study demonstrates that music is capable of triggering a combination of specific cross-modal and emotional effects in the multisensory tasting experience of a chocolate. © 2020 by the authors.

This change of paradigm in the construction of test plans for lot acceptance provides optimal inspection schemes from both frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. Classes of admissible test plans minimizing the weighted-average risks are first defined. Constrained optimization problems are then solved in order to determine sample sizes with smallest classical or expected weighted-average risks, as well as acceptance test plans with minimal inspection effort and controlled risks. The proposed methodology to determine optimal sample sizes and decision criteria for lot sentencing constitutes a plausible consensus between Frequentists and Bayesians. Moreover, the use of prior information on the fraction defective allows the practitioners to appreciably reduce the required sample size for lot screening. Optimal lot inspection schemes can also be easily updated using past performance of the sampling plans. Besides the advantages the suggested approach has for hypothesis testing, namely large sample consistency and reproducible results, it permits to make a trade-off between the opposite goals of customers and manufacturers. Some applications in reliability demonstration testing and industrial quality control are presented for illustrative purposes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Kriging Kalman combined filter to estimate and predict the evolution of climatic states in some weather stations in Ecuador<\/b><br><br>This article proposes a methodology that involves the Universal Kriging filter (UKF) and the Kalman filter (KF) to study temporal-space dynamic models. Spatial prediction surfaces are constructed using the UKF and the KF is used to estimate the temporal effects. The UKF provides a successful estimation approach from the point of view of spatial statistics, while the KF describes a well-established recursive procedure to estimate the states and parameters in these models. The methodology is illustrated using 30-year time series of 3 meteorological stations in Ecuador. The model allows to make predictions on temperature, precipitation and humidity, obtaining estimates of unknown states very similar when compared to original series. The root mean square error was used as a measure of goodness of fit to measure the estimation quality of the algorithm, obtaining satisfactory results. © 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

Available information on patterns of genetic differentiation in C. acutus shows a complex structuring influenced by interspecific interactions (mainly hybridization) and anthropogenic actions (mostly historical hunting, recent poaching, habitat loss and fragmentation, and unintentional translocation of individuals). In this study, we used data on mitochondrial DNA control region and 11 nuclear polymorphic microsatellite loci to assess the degree of population structure of C. acutus in South America, North America, Central America and the Greater Antilles. We used traditional genetic differentiation indices, Bayesian clustering and multivariate methods to create a more comprehensive picture of the genetic relationships within the species across its range. Analyses of mtDNA and microsatellite loci show evidence of a strong population genetic structure in the American crocodile, with unique populations in each sampling locality. Our results support previous findings showing large degrees of genetic differentiation between the continental and the Greater Antillean C. acutus. We report three new haplotypes unique to Venezuela, which are considerably less distant from the Central and North American haplotypes than to the Greater Antillean ones. Our findings reveal genetic population differentiation between Cuban and Jamaican C. acutus and offer the first evidence of strong genetic differentiation among the populations of Greater Antillean C. acutus.

Four states: Anxiety, pain, engagement and tiredness (either physical or psychological), were hypothesized to be inferable from observable metrics of hand location and gripping strength-relevant for rehabilitation. Contributions are; (a) multiresolution classifier built from Semi-Naïve Bayesian classifiers, and (b) establishing predictive relations for the considered states from the motor proxies capitalizing on the proposed classifier with recognition levels sufficient for exploitation. 3D hand locations and gripping strength streams were recorded from 5 post-stroke patients whilst undergoing motor rehabilitation therapy administered through virtual rehabilitation along 10 sessions over 4 weeks. Features from the streams characterized the motor dynamics, while spontaneous manifestations of the states were labelled from concomitant videos by experts for supervised classification. The new classifier was compared against baseline support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) with all three exhibiting comparable performances. Inference of the aforementioned states departing from chosen motor surrogates appears feasible, expediting increased personalization of virtual motor neurorehabilitation therapies. © 2018 IEEE.","<b>Climatic affinities of Neotropical species of Capparaceae: An approach from ecological niche modelling and numerical ecology<\/b><br><br>In the Neotropics, the distribution of Capparaceae has been historically associated with seasonally dry forest (NSDF), but recent taxonomic studies have questioned this assumption. Given the environmental co-occurrence of species and the need to understand their relationships with the ecosystem, we use ecological niche modelling and numerical ecology methods to better describe the distribution patterns of Capparaceae and their climatic affinities with NSDF. We used the Maxent algorithm to model the ecological niches of 104 species of Capparaceae, which gave maximum values of the response curves for climatic suitability. These values were used to carry out multivariate statistical analyses [principal components analysis (PCA), non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and discriminant analysis (DA)] to identify ecological associations based on climatic similitude among species. Both PCA and NMDS showed that annual precipitation, precipitation of the wettest quarter and precipitation of the driest quarter were the most important climatic variables shaping distributions of species and their associations with NSDF, moist tropical forest (MTF) and wet tropical forest (WTF). Although we found 72 species associated with NSDF as previously reported, DA revealed an overlapping pattern among the three ecological/climatic assemblages (NSDF, MTF and WTF). This confirms the existence of transition zones and species with wider niches. Our results provide an important biogeographical framework of ecological patterns for species associated with NSDF, opening new lines of research on the reconstruction of distribution in future climatic scenarios or palaeo-distributions. © 2020 Crown copyright 2020.","<b>Malaria in Venezuela: Changes in the complexity of infection reflects the increment in transmission intensity<\/b><br><br>Background: Malaria incidence has reached staggering numbers in Venezuela. Commonly, Bolívar State accounted for approximately 70% of the country cases every year. Most cases cluster in the Sifontes municipality, a region characterized by an extractive economy, including gold mining. An increase in migration to Sifontes, driven by gold mining, fueled a malaria spillover to the rest of the country and the region. Here samples collected in 2018 were compared with a previous study of 2003/2004 to describe changes in the parasites population structures and the frequency of point mutations linked to anti-malarial drugs. Methods: A total of 88 Plasmodium falciparum and 94 Plasmodium vivax isolates were collected in 2018 and compared with samples from 2003/2004 (106 P. falciparum and 104 P. vivax). For P. falciparum, mutations linked to drug resistance (Pfdhfr, Pfdhps, and Pfcrt) and the Pfk13 gene associated with artemisinin delayed parasite clearance, were analysed. To estimate the multiplicity of infection (MOI), and perform P. falciparum and P. vivax population genetic analyses, the parasites were genotyped by using eight standardized microsatellite loci. Results: The P. falciparum parasites are still harbouring drug-resistant mutations in Pfdhfr, Pfdhps, and Pfcrt. However, there was a decrease in the frequency of highly resistant Pfdhps alleles. Mutations associated with artemisinin delayed parasite clearance in the Pfk13 gene were not found. Consistent with the increase in transmission, polyclonal infections raised from 1.9% in 2003/2004 to 39% in 2018 in P. falciparum and from 16.3 to 68% in P. vivax. There is also a decrease in linkage disequilibrium. Bayesian clustering yields two populations linked to the time of sampling, showing that the parasite populations temporarily changed. However, the samples from 2003/2004 and 2018 have several alleles per locus in common without sharing multi-locus genotypes. Conclusions: The frequency of mutations linked with drug resistance in P. falciparum shows only changes in Pfdhps. Observations presented here are consistent with an increase in transmission from the previously circulating parasites. Following populations longitudinally, using molecular surveillance, provides valuable information in cases such as Venezuela with a fluid malaria situation that is affecting the regional goals toward elimination. © 2020 The Author(s).","<b>Multilayer network analysis of oil linkages<\/b><br><br>This manuscript proposes a new approach for unveiling existing linkages within the international oil market across multiple driving factors beyond production. A multilayer, multicountry network is extracted through a novel Bayesian graphical vector autoregressive model, which allows for a more comprehensive, dynamic representation of the network linkages than do traditional or static pairwise Granger-causal inference approaches. Building on previous work, the layers of the network include country-and region-specific oil production levels and rigs, both through simultaneous and lagged temporal dependences among key factors, while controlling for oil prices and a world economic activity index. The proposed approach extracts relationships across all variables through a dynamic, cross-regional network. This approach is highly scalable and adjusts for time-evolving linkages. The model outcome is a set of time-varying graphical networks that unveil both static representations of world oil linkages and variations in microeconomic relationships both within and between oil producers. An example is provided, illustrating the evolution of intra-and inter-regional relationships for two major interconnected oil producers: the United States, with a regional decomposition of its production and rig deployment, and the Arabian Peninsula and key Middle Eastern producers, with a country-based decomposition of production and rig deployment, while controlling for oil prices and global economic indices. Production is less affected by concurrent changes in oil prices and the overall economy than rigs. However, production is a lagged driver for prices, rather than rigs, which indicates that the linkage between rigs and production may not be fully accounted for in the markets. © 2020 Royal Economic Society.

In this regard, policy and decision makers require accurate tools for risk estimation in order to take informed decisions. This work proposes a Bayesian framework for a unified treatment and statistical modeling of the main components of risk: hazard, vulnerability and exposure. Risk is defined as the expected economic loss or population affected as a consequence of a hazard event. The vulnerability is interpreted as the loss experienced by an exposed population due to hazard events. The framework combines data of different spatial and temporal supports. It produces a sequence of temporal risk maps for the domain of interest including a measure of uncertainty for the hazard and vulnerability. In particular, the considered hazard (rainfall) is interpolated from point-based measured rainfall data using a hierarchical spatio-temporal Kriging model, whose parameters are estimated using the Bayesian paradigm. Vulnerability is modeled using zero-inflated distributions with parameters dependent on climatic variables at local and large scales. Exposure is defined as the total population settled in the spatial domain and is interpolated using census data. The proposed methodology was applied to the Vargas state of Venezuela to map the spatio-temporal risk for the period 1970–2006. The framework highlights both high and low risk areas given extreme rainfall events. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","<b>Techniques of financial multiples to value shares of companies in the electricity sector in colombia<\/b><br><br>Introduction: Through this article, a new procedure for the valuation of shares is documented, through business financial multiples, but with the support of statistical techniques for the future projection of scenarios, tools for simulation, and even Bayesian models of continuous valuation of relative indicators in time. Objective: Develop a financial statistical technique to assess share price in the secondary market in the medium term. Materials and Methods: This methodology introduces a new concept of valuation, combining the traditional technique of financial multiples with the probabilistic simulation of future scenarios through the use of Risk Simulator and finally the creation of a percentage indicator to estimate the share price in the secondary market, by means of a Bayesian dynamic linear model of these previous simulations. Results: In this work five phases were documented, which begin with an analysis of the information provided by Bloomberg in the Colombian electricity sector companies (ISAGEN, CELSIA and ISA), and then generate a structure through the use of multiples financial policies defined and documented for its application. Based on this structural information, the variables used in the valuation for the future five years (until 2020) were projected, with the purpose of calculating the financial multiples of the theoretical results and being able to perform Monte Carlo simulations based on established probability distributions for each causal variable, according to their historical behavior. Conclusions: Finally, with these values of the financial multiples determined through the simulation, and the real price of the share in the market, the Relative Comparison Indicator (IRC) is calculated, which will present historical values, offering support for making projections through a Bayesian Dynamic Linear Model, in order to forecast in the medium term the average annual share value for each company in the electricity sector in Colombia (ISAGEN, CELSIA and ISA) during the years 2016 to 2020. © 2020 Corporacion Universitaria Lasallista.

Although the concept of CX is widely used, not much has been examined about how external touch points impact customer perception of experience. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to examine the role and impact of internal and external touchpoints as dimensions of customer experience and how CX can impact consumer word-of-mouth intention. Service outcome and peace of mind were used to represent internal experience touchpoints and peer to peer quality (PTP) was used to represent an external experience touchpoint. A total of 293 usable surveys were used for analysis using a Bayesian model developed for this study instead of the more traditional SEM approaches. Results showed that an external experience touchpoint has a similar impact to those of internal experience touchpoints in the experience process. CX was also found to have a strong effect on customer word of mouth intention. These findings make various contributions to the literature on CX, especially to research differentiating internal from external experience touchpoints. On the practical side, this study provides recommendations to retailers about how to manage an external touchpoint. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","<b>Predict the magnitudes of seismic events using Bayesian methods<\/b><br><br>The phase spectrum is an important characteristic of earthquake motion. Although amplitude and phase spectrum is essential to simulate an earthquake motion, the arrival time of a wave component with frequency and the distribution width of the group delay time are related to the duration of the time history of the wave component, its modeling is much easier than direct modeling of phase spectrum. In this paper, a stochastic differential equation (SDE) was considered to simulate the group delay time (GDT) of earthquake ground motion. A brief review of probabilistic Bayesian methods (Monte Carlos Sequential Methods) to handle earthquake data is presented. A methodology based on recursive algorithms is proposed that allows estimating and predict the magnitudes of seismic events from the time, location and magnitude of the event past. To approximate the solution of the stochastic differential equation, the Euler-Maruyama and Milstein structures were defined. New approaches for collective analysis of the data and an engineering model for the source are discussed with a few numerical results. © 2019","<b>Genetic diversity of Tambaqui (Teleostei - Characidae) broodstocks from Northern region of Brazil using microsatellite markers<\/b><br><br>The Amazonian fish Tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) is the most common native species in Brazil. This species has the highest production rate in the Northern region, especially in the State of Rondônia. The genetic evaluation of Tambaqui is an extremely important to increase productivity in fish farms or improve the adaptability in restocking natural populations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the genetic diversity of three Tambaqui broodstocks in Rondônia, Brazil. Six microsatellite markers were used to analyze a total of 89 breeders collected from three fish farms located in Ji-Paraná (JP), Ouro Preto do Oeste (OP) and Presidente Médici (PM). A total of 37 alleles between 140 and 310 bp were found, including the presence of exclusive and low frequency alleles in the three broodstocks. The average values of observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.404 (PM) to 0.499 (JP). The FIS coefficient values were positive for the three broodstocks, demonstrating a deficit of heterozygotes. The Molecular Variance Analysis (AMOVA) showed greater variation within the stocks than between them. The genetic differentiation was moderate and significant between the stocks, with higher differentiation between JP x PM and lower between OP x PM. The Bayesian analysis designated an optimal value of K = 3 groupings. Although there is moderate genetic diversity between broodstocks, the high FIS indicates a possible decline of diversity in the next generations, and therefore, the incorporation of new breeders is suggested to increase the genetic diversity in the three stocks. © 2020 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

Triticosecale Wittmack) silage with chemical and biological additives<\/b><br><br>The objective of this study was to evaluate the ruminal degradability of dry matter and crude protein of high moisture triticale silage ensiled with different chemical and biological additives. Urea, sodium benzoate and an enzyme-bacterial inoculant were used as treatments. Four samples from each treatment were incubated in rumen on four sheep. Effective degradability was estimated for ruminal passage rate of 2%, 5% and 8% hour-1. Bayesian procedures were used to estimate potential degradation parameters in situ. The high moisture triticale silage with urea showed highest value for the soluble fraction (70.46%) and the best effective dry matter degradability, with a passing rate of 2% h-1 (90.63%), of control silage at other rates of passage. In relation to control silage, the addition of sodium benzoate and enzyme-bacterial inoculant decreased the effective degradability of dry matter, regardless of rate passage evaluated. Due to high solubility of urea, the silage added with this additive had the highest soluble fraction of crude protein (76.42%). The addition of enzyme-bacterial inoculant accelerated the ruminal passage rate of dry matter and protein to 0.26 and 0.20% h-1, respectively, providing less potential degradability of both in relation to other silages. As enzyme-bacterial inoculation reduces rumen degradability of crude protein, it tends to increase the availability of amino acids for intestinal absorption. The addition of urea to high moisture triticale silage may be recommended for sheep feeding at a low level of consumption, as it improves the effective dry matter degradability. © 2020 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

In this paper is proposed two statistical models based on a system of stochastic differential equations (SDE) that model the dynamics of population growth, and three computational algorithms that allow the generation of probability distribution samples in high dimensions, in models that have non-linear structures and that are useful for making inferences. The algorithms allow to estimate simultaneously states solutions and parameters in SDE models. The interpretation of the parameters is important because they are related to the variables of growth, mortality, migration, physical-chemical conditions of the environment, among other factors. The algorithms are illustrated using real data from a sector of the population of the Republic of Ecuador, and are compared with the results obtained with the models used by theWorld Bank for the same data, which shows that stochastic models Proposals based on an SDE more adequately and reliably adjust the dynamics of demographic randomness, sampling errors and environmental randomness in comparison with the deterministic models used by the World Bank. It is observed that the population grows year by year and seems to have a definite tendency; that is, a clearly growing behavior is seen. To measure the relative success of the algorithms, the relative error was estimated, obtaining small percentage errors. © 2020 International Academic Press.","<b>Hidden Markov model-based heartbeat detector using different transformations of ECG and ABP signals<\/b><br><br>The detection of the heartbeat from electrocardiographic (ECG) and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals, either exploited individually or jointly, has been carried out successfully using different approaches that range from the use of simple digital signal processing techniques until the use of more advanced techniques based on machine learning. In this paper, we employed a heartbeat detector that uses two hidden Markov models (HMM) to characterize the dynamics of the presence and the absence of heartbeats in ECG and ABP signals. The HMM-based detector can exploit univariate observations (ECG or ABP signals) or bivariate observations (ECG an ABP signals jointly, in a centralized manner). Two transformations of the signals were applied as a preprocessing step: absolute value and squared functions. In this sense, six detectors based on univariate observations and nine detectors based on bivariate observations were conceived and validated in ten records of the MGH/MF Waveform Database. The detection performance when the absolute value of ECG and the absolute value of ABP are jointly exploited by the HMM produced T P = 58736, FN = 631, FP = 788, sensitivity = 98.73%, positive predictivity = 98.22%). © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Mathematical models that try to describe these phenomena have nonlinear structures, observations are made at discrete time points and include measurement errors, and are difficult to estimate. In particular, when modeling dynamics of repeated measurements on individuals or objects, they are analyzed by mixed-effects diffusion models. The standard estimation methods in these cases are: maximum likelihood, EM, SAEM, Newton Raphson, among others. In this paper we propose a specific inference methodology for models. Apply extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to the estimation of both states and parameters of nonlinear state-space models. To illustrate the methodology, the states and parameters of an Ornstein- Uhlembeck (O-U) mixed-effects model were estimated, obtaining precise estimates with small standard deviations. To measure the estimation quality of the algorithms was used as a measure of goodness-of-fit known as the square root of the mean quadratic error, obtaining very small errors. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","<b>Joint Exploitation of Hemodynamic and Electrocardiographic Signals by Hidden Markov Models for Heartbeat Detection<\/b><br><br>The detection of heartbeats is a fundamental task in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. In a clinical setting, heartbeats are commonly detected from the electrocardiographic (ECG) signal, but it can also be estimated from hemodynamic signals, such as arterial blood pressure (ABP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and central venous pressure (CVP). In this paper, we conceived three HMM-based detectors that jointly exploit the information from ECG and ABP ($$ D_{ECG \\& ABP}$$ ), ECG and PAP ($$ D_{ECG \\& PAP}$$ ), and ECG and CVP ($$ D_{ECG \\& CVP}$$ ). The HMM-based detectors are based on the comparison of the difference of log-likelihoods of observation of two competing models that learned the dynamics of the presence and absence of a heartbeat, respectively. The detection performances of the bivariate centralized detectors were similar, but the detector that simultaneously considers ECG and ABP provide the best result (sensitivity = 98.91% and positive predictivity = 99.11%). These results agree when a univariate HMM-based detector only considers the ECG signal in the decision process. The centralized bivariate detection approach proposed in this paper make uses of redundant information in the decision process and is particularly useful when one of the signals is too noisy or missing. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>Diversification history in the Dendrocincla fuliginosa complex (Aves: Dendrocolaptidae): Insights from broad geographic sampling<\/b><br><br>Dendrocincla woodcreepers are ant-following birds widespread throughout tropical America. Species in the genus are widely distributed and show little phenotypic variation. Notwithstanding, several subspecies have been described, but the validity of some of these taxa and the boundaries among them have been discussed for decades. Recent genetic evidence based on limited sampling has pointed to the paraphyly of D. fuliginosa, showing that its subspecies constitute a complex that also includes D. anabatina and D. turdina. In this study we sequenced nuclear and mitochondrial markers for over two hundred individuals belonging to the D. fuliginosa complex to recover phylogenetic relationships, describe intraspecific genetic diversity and provide historical biogeographic scenarios of diversification. Our results corroborate the paraphyly of D. fuliginosa, with D. turdina and D. anabatina nested within its recognized subspecies. Recovered genetic lineages roughly match the distributions of described subspecies and congruence among phylogenetic structure, phenotypic diagnosis and distribution limits were used to discuss current systematics and taxonomy within the complex, with special attention to Northern South America. Our data suggest the origin of the complex in western Amazonia, associated with the establishment of upland forests in the area during the early Pliocene. Paleoclimatic cycles and river rearrangements during the Pleistocene could have, at different times, both facilitated dispersal across large Amazonian rivers and the Andes and isolated populations, likely playing an important role in differentiation of extant species. Previously described hybridization in the headwaters of the Tapajós river represents a secondary contact of non-sister lineages that cannot be used to test the role of the river as primary source of diversification. Based on comparisons of D. fuliginosa with closely related understory upland forest taxa, we suggest that differential habitat use could influence diversification processes in a historically changing landscape, and should be considered for proposing general mechanisms of diversification. © 2019","<b>Genetic diversification of Panstrongylus geniculatus (Reduviidae: Triatominae) in northern South America<\/b><br><br>Triatomines are the vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Although Triatoma and Rhodnius are the most-studied vector genera, other triatomines, such as Panstrongylus, also transmit T. cruzi, creating new epidemiological scenarios. Panstrongylus has at least 13 reported species but there is limited information about its intraspecific genetic variation and patterns of diversification. Here, we begin to fill this gap by studying populations of P. geniculatus from Colombia and Venezuela and including other epidemiologically important species from the region. We examined the pattern of diversification of P. geniculatus in Colombia using mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal data. Genetic diversity and differentiation were calculated within and among populations of P. geniculatus. Moreover, we constructed maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference phylogenies and haplotype networks using P. geniculatus and other species from the genus (P. megistus, P. lignarius, P. lutzi, P. tupynambai, P. chinai, P. rufotuberculatus and P. howardi). Using a coalescence framework, we also dated the P. geniculatus lineages. The total evidence tree showed that P. geniculatus is a monophyletic species, with four clades that are concordant with its geographic distribution and are partly explained by the Andes orogeny. However, other factors, including anthropogenic and eco-epidemiological effects must be investigated to explain the existence of recent geographic P. geniculatus lineages. The epidemiological dynamics in structured vector populations, such as those found here, warrant further investigation. Extending our knowledge of P. geniculatus is necessary for the accurate development of effective strategies for the control of Chagas disease vectors. © 2019 Caicedo-Garzón et al.","<b>Automatic Recognition of Multiple Affective States in Virtual Rehabilitation by Exploiting the Dependency Relationships<\/b><br><br>The automatic recognition of multiple affective states can be enhanced if the underpinning computational models explicitly consider the interactions between the states. This work proposes a computational model that incorporates the dependencies between four states (tiredness, anxiety, pain, and engagement)known to appear in virtual rehabilitation sessions of post-stroke patients, to improve the automatic recognition of the patients' states. A dataset of five stroke patients which includes their fingers' pressure (PRE), hand movements (MOV)and facial expressions (FAE)during ten sessions of virtual rehabilitation was used. Our computational proposal uses the Semi-Naive Bayesian classifier (SNBC)as base classifier in a multiresolution approach to create a multimodal model with the three sensors (PRE, MOV, and FAE)with late fusion using SNBC (FSNB classifier). There is a FSNB classifier for each state, and they are linked in a circular classifier chain (CCC)to exploit the dependency relationships between the states. Results of CCC are over 90% of ROC AUC for the four states. Relationships of mutual exclusion between engagement and all the other states and some co-occurrences between pain and anxiety for the five patients were detected. Virtual rehabilitation platforms that incorporate the automatic recognition of multiple patient's states could leverage intelligent and empathic interactions to promote adherence to rehabilitation exercises. © 2019 IEEE.","<b>Spreading the Word: How Customer Experience in a Traditional Retail Setting Influences Consumer Traditional and Electronic Word-of-mouth Intention<\/b><br><br>The study of customer experience has gained substantial importance in the consumer behavior field because of how it impacts the development of long-term relationships with customers. The next frontier of customer experience research involves new contexts represented by new channels offered by retailers, thus sparking research interest in the experience lived by customers not only in physical stores but also in virtual stores as a clear representation of the concept of omni-channels. Within this context, consumers’ actions on social media are particularly important because they can act as product or service endorsements to other customers affecting their purchase intentions. In this article, we attempt to bridge the gap between real-world retail experiences and how they connect with the online retail environment through consumer behavior contrasting traditional and eWOM intention at the point of experience immediately after its consumption in a physical setting. In order to do so, a Bayesian hierarchical approach is used to provide an adaptable, low-sample statistical infrastructure for the analysis of the proposed relationships. Our findings show that customer experience in physical stores still have a higher impact on consumer traditional WOM intention than on eWOM intention. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Parameter estimation for scarce stellar populations<\/b><br><br>We present a Bayesian method to determine simultaneously the age, metallicity, distance modulus, and interstellar reddening by dust of any resolved stellar population, by comparing the observed and synthetic colour magnitude diagrams on a star by star basis, with no need to bin the data into a carefully selected magnitude grid. We test the method with mock stellar populations, and show that it works correctly even for scarce stellar populations with only one or two hundred stars above themain sequence turn-off. If the population is the result of two star formation bursts, we can infer the contribution of each event to the total stellar population. The code works automatically and has already been used to study massive amounts of Magellanic clouds photometric data. In this paper, we analyse in detail three Large Magellanic Cloud star clusters and six ultra faint dwarf galaxies. For these galaxies, we recover physical parameters in agreement with those quoted in the literature, age ~13.7 Gyr and a very low metallicity log Z ~ -4. Searching for multiple populations in these galaxies, we find, at a very low significance level, signs of a double stellar population for Ursa Major I: a dominant old population and a younger one which contributes ~25 per cent of the stars, in agreement with independent results from other authors. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.","<b>Recognition of affective states in virtual rehabilitation using late fusion with semi-Naive Bayesian classifier<\/b><br><br>Virtual rehabilitation platforms may tailor the rehabilitation tasks to the patients’ needs if they could recognize the patient’s affective state.

Data streams were recorded from 5 post-stroke patients while they attended virtual rehabilitation therapies along 10 sessions over 4 weeks, manifesting the aforementioned states spontaneously.

This methodology arises from the need to consider the various mechanical factors and the geological parameters that influence the drift deviation, which conduce to no vertical drilling and phenomena of torque and drag. The anticipated model will acquire importance for the evaluation with the different efforts for which it will be in the next stage of the drill string. The methodology is exposed through the reconstruction of states of the synthetic model states proposed by Johancsik, Friesen, and Dawson, using the Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), observing good adjustment of torsion and drag states estimated by the filters with respect to the real values. Filters performance was evaluated in terms of the mean square error, showing variability of the estimated errors 0.05 for EnKF and 0.01 for UKF and a fast execution of the algorithms 3.07 (seg) for EnKF and 0.48 (seg) for UKF. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Nation Branding: Unveiling Factors that Affect the Image of Colombia from a Foreign Perspective<\/b><br><br>Most countries are concerned about the image they project in international markets. They have adopted and implemented differentiation strategies in order to stimulate tourism and economic investment. In the case of Colombia's reputation, it has been built on unplanned positioning, interests and views of a few opinion leaders, political and economic instability and transformations in the productive sector. This paper outlines, using a Bayesian variable selection approach, the perception of foreign visitors and prospects on Colombia's country image, and proposes a methodological framework for unvailing those driving factors. Findings of this research demonstrate that countries may be seen positively from the point of view of visitors while prospects may have a negative image of them.

The general objective of this study is to determine simultaneously: non-linearity, structural changes, asymmetries and outliers that are characteristics present in many financial series. The methodology is empirically illustrated using series that measure the annual growth rate of industrial production in the MERCOSUR countries. The sampling algorithm [1] is implemented to estimate the parameters of the model. The parameters were estimated in terms of expected values a posteriori and standard deviations a posteriori. Three criteria is used to assess the prediction model: square root of the mean quadratic error (RSME), the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test and the TRC statistical test. These measures of goodness-of-fit show, that the estimates have small errors. The execution time of the algorithm is calculated, observing high performance. As a result of the analysis of the data, it is concluded that there is no reduction of economic volatility and no reduction in the depth of economic cycles. At the breakpoints, atypical values and non-linearity in the data are observed. It also shows that there are no common economic cycles for the countries analyzed. © 2019 ASEPUMA.

This study compares specific physicochemical properties of soil between C. guanhumi burrows (B) and adjacent zones (AZ), and provides the first insights on their role as an ecosystem engineer in mangroves. The study was conducted in an estuarine system dominated by Rhizophora mangle, located at the Río Chico estuary, Miranda state of Venezuela. Random soil samples were taken digging each burrow until reaching the bottom and at the same depth for AZ. Data analysis was carried out using Bayesian inference. Credible mean differences between B and AZ, were found for sand (B = 26.53 ± 10.76, AZ = 17.25 ± 5.7%), silt (B = 73.16 ± 10.77, AZ = 82.42 ± 5.69%), pH (B = 8.71 ± 0.36, AZ = 9.12 ± 0.30), soil organic matter (SOM, B = 0.43 ± 0.21, AZ = 0.17 ± 0.06%), total N (TN, B = 786 ± 232, AZ = 529 ± 107 µg g−1), Mg (B = 4.42 ± 0.60, AZ = 3.48 ± 0.71 cmolc kg−1) and K (B = 0.12 ± 0.05 AZ = 0.06 ± 0.02 cmolc kg−1). Chemical variables as SOM, K, Mg and TN showed the highest values of effect size (> 1.4). With the exception of the pH, all chemicals variables—which were different between B and AZ—showed strong and decisive evidences of correlations with SOM. When SOM variable was controlled, the relationships between pH–TN, TN–K and Mg–K decreased, even though the correlation evidence between each pair remained. Differences in chemical contents found in B respect to AZ suggest that the activities of C. guanhumi (feeding, moulting, excretion and defecation) within their burrows promote the spatial heterogeneity of mangrove soils. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","<b>Reconstructing the origins and the biogeography of species’ genomes in the highly reticulate allopolyploid-rich model grass genus Brachypodium using minimum evolution, coalescence and maximum likelihood approaches<\/b><br><br>The identification of homeologous genomes and the biogeographical analyses of highly reticulate allopolyploid-rich groups face the challenge of incorrectly inferring the genomic origins and the biogeographical patterns of the polyploids from unreliable strictly bifurcating trees. Here we reconstruct a plausible evolutionary scenario of the diverging and merging genomes inherited by the diploid and allopolyploid species and cytotypes of the model grass genus Brachypodium. We have identified the ancestral Brachypodium genomes and inferred the paleogeographical ranges for potential hybridization events that originated its allopolyploid taxa. We also constructed a comprehensive phylogeny of Brachypodium from five nuclear and plastid genes using Species Tree Minimum Evolution allele grafting and Species Network analysis. The divergence ages of the lineages were estimated from a consensus maximum clade credibility tree using fossil calibrations, whereas ages of origin of the diploid and allopolyploid species were inferred from coalescence Bayesian methods. The biogeographical events of the genomes were reconstructed using a stratified Dispersal-Extinction-Colonization model with three temporal windows. Our combined Minimum Evolution-coalescence-Bayesian approach allowed us to infer the origins and the identities of the homeologous genomes of the Brachypodium allopolyploids, matching the expected ploidy levels of the hybrids. To date, the current extant progenitor genomes (species) are only known for B. hybridum. Putative ancestral homeologous genome have been inherited by B. mexicanum, ancestral and recent genomes by B. boissieri, and only recently evolved genomes by B. retusum and the core perennial clade allopolyploids (B. phoenicoides, B. pinnatum 4x, B. rupestre 4x). We dissected the complex spatio-temporal evolution of ancestral and recent genomes and have detected successive splitting, dispersal and merging events for dysploid homeologous genomes in diverse geographical scenarios that have led to the current extant taxa. Our data support Mid-Miocene splits of the Holarctic ancestral genomes that preceded the Late Miocene origins of Brachypodium ancestors of the modern diploid species. Successive divergences of the annual B. stacei and B. distachyon diploid genomes were implied to have occurred in the Mediterranean region during the Late Miocene-Pliocene. By contrast, a profusion of splits, range expansions and different genome mergings were inferred for the perennial diploid genomes in the Mediterranean and Eurasian regions, with sporadic colonizations and further mergings in other continents during the Quaternary. A reliable biogeographical scenario was obtained for the Brachypodium genomes and allopolyploids where homeologous genomes split from their respective diploid counterpart lineages in the same ancestral areas, showing similar or distinct dispersals. By contrast, the allopolyploid taxa remained in the same ancestral ranges after hybridization and genome doubling events. Our approach should have utility in deciphering the genomic composition and the historical biogeography of other allopolyploid-rich organismal groups, which are predominant in eukaryotes. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Analysis of the Observation Sequence Duration of Hidden Markov Models for QRS Complex Detection in Single-Lead ECG Recordings<\/b><br><br>Hidden Markov models (HMM) are useful tools to characterize the dynamics of observation sequences. However, the duration of the observation sequence to characterize is often chosen empirically, based on a priori information. In this paper, we used a grid search approach to optimize two hyperparameters of an HMM-based QRS complex detector, namely, the duration of the observation sequence to be characterized and the adaptive decision threshold that compares the difference of log-likelihoods of observations from two competing HMM. To assure the reproducibility of the results, we have run the optimization process ten times using different random seeds per realization. Using the ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database, we have found an optimal adaptive decision threshold of 60% but the optimal value of the observation sequence duration varies from 100 ms to 120 ms for different realizations of the optimization process. Consequently, the different parameters of the HMM-based QRS complex detector found in each realization do not always lead to the same detection performance. Using the optimal values, the detector achieves a sensitivity of 96.53% and a positive predictivity of 98.16%. © 2018 Creative Commons Attribution.","<b>The galactic thick disc density profile traced with RR lyrae stars<\/b><br><br>We used a combination of public RR Lyrae star catalogues and a Bayesian methodology to derive robust structural parameters of the inner halo (<25 kpc) and thick disc of the MilkyWay. RR Lyrae stars are an unequivocal tracer of old metal-poor populations, for which accurate distances and extinctions can be individually estimated and so are a reliable independent means of tracing the population of the old high-[α/Fe] disc usually associated with the thick disc. In particular, the chosen RR Lyrae sample spans regions at low galactic latitude towards the anticentre direction, allowing to probe the outermost parts of the disc. Our results favour a thick disc with short-scale height and short-scale length, hz=0.65+0.09-0.05 kpc, hR = 2.1+0.82 -0.25 kpc, for a model in which the inner halo has a constant flattening of q = 0.90+0.05 -0.03 and a power-law index of n = -2.78+0.05 -0.05. Similar short scales for the thick disc are also found when considering an inner halo with flattening dependent on radius.We also explored a model in which the thick disc has a flare and, although this is only mildly constrained with our data, a flare onset in the inner ~11 kpc is highly disfavoured. © 2018 The Author(s).

The particularities of the DTC such as its behavior, its standard heuristic derivation, and its nature of been a nonlinear hysteresis-based predictive controller are exploited, thus allowing the improvement and development of alternative explanations to the phenomena. The understanding of DTC and the development of the current state-space model of the asymmetric IM, presented here for first time in the literature, enables the analytical treatment of the research topic and the discovery of several DTC reactions to the fault. The ITSC impact on DTC and its reaction leads to the following twofold characterizations: first, unobservable and visible effects, and second, compensation and tolerant reactions. For purposes of simulation, a plug-and-play configurable circuit-block for the asymmetric IM was developed based on Norton's equivalent circuit. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the assertiveness of the developed analyses and theoretical findings, which allows future research in online fault diagnostics and condition monitoring of inverter-fed IM with this type of fault. © 2018 IEEE.","<b>Knowing when to stop: Aberrant precision and evidence accumulation in schizophrenia<\/b><br><br>Predictive coding and active inference formulations of the dysconnection hypothesis suggest that subjects with schizophrenia (SZ) hold unduly precise prior beliefs to compensate for a failure of sensory attenuation. This implies that SZ subjects should both initiate responses prematurely during evidence-accumulation tasks and fail to inhibit their responses at long stop-signal delays. SZ and healthy control subjects were asked to report the timing of billiards-ball collisions and were occasionally required to withhold their responses. SZ subjects showed larger temporal estimation errors, which were associated with premature responses and decreased response inhibition. To account for these effects, we used hierarchical (Bayesian) drift-diffusion models (HDDM) and model selection procedures to adjudicate among four hypotheses. HDDM revealed that the precision of prior beliefs (i.e., starting point) rather than increased sensory precision (i.e., drift rate) drove premature responses and impaired response inhibition in patients with SZ. From the perspective of active inference, we suggest that premature predictions in SZ are responses that, heuristically, are traded off against accuracy to ensure action execution. On the basis of previous work, we suggest that the right insular cortex might mediate this trade-off. © 2018 The Authors","<b>QRS complex detection based on continuous density hidden Markov models using univariate observations<\/b><br><br>In the electrocardiogram (ECG), the detection of QRS complexes is a fundamental step in the ECG signal processing chain since it allows the determination of other characteristics waves of the ECG and provides information about heart rate variability. In this work, an automatic QRS complex detector based on continuous density hidden Markov models (HMM) is proposed. HMM were trained using univariate observation sequences taken either from QRS complexes or their derivatives. The detection approach is based on the log-likelihood comparison of the observation sequence with a fixed threshold. A sliding window was used to obtain the observation sequence to be evaluated by the model. The threshold was optimized by receiver operating characteristic curves. Sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spc) and F1 score were used to evaluate the detection performance. The approach was validated using ECG recordings from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. A 6-fold cross-validation shows that the best detection performance was achieved with 2 states HMM trained with QRS complexes sequences (Sen = 0.668, Spc = 0.360 and F1 = 0.309). We concluded that these univariate sequences provide enough information to characterize the QRS complex dynamics from HMM.

During the period 2006–2011, a total of 1132 fish were sampled by scientific observers on board Venezuelan and Brazilian longline vessels and from artisanal fisheries based out of Cumaná, Puerto La Cruz and Playa Verde, Venezuela and Cabo Frio, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The ovaries of 543 females were classified into five ovarian development phases based on microscopic analysis of the most advanced group of oocytes. Generalized additive models were applied to the gonadal index and sex ratio data in order to assess spatio-temporal trends of the reproductive activity and identify the spawning areas. Space–time effect was a significant factor contributing to changes in sex ratio and reproductive activity. Spawning activity was observed in two distinct areas. On the south-east Brazilian coast spawning peaked during December–February, while in the south-eastern Caribbean Sea spawning occurred between March and September, with its peak in March and April. Using a Bayesian approach, size at 50% maturity was estimated to be 146.12 cm (credibility interval of 95%, 138.45–152.09 cm). Batch fecundity ranged from 436,800 to 2,492,500 hydrated oocytes per female. This study confirms multiple aggregation spawning for this species in the western Atlantic Ocean. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","<b>On geographic barriers and Pleistocene glaciations: Tracing the diversification of the Russet-crowned Warbler (Myiothlypis coronata) along the Andes<\/b><br><br>We studied the phylogeography and plumage variation of the Russet-crowned Warbler (Myiothlypis coronata), from Venezuela to Bolivia, with focus on populations from Ecuador and northern Peru. We analyzed sequences of mitochondrial and nuclear genes, geographic distributions, as well as photographs of specimens deposited at museum collections. Phylogenetic analyses identified three major lineages formed by populations from: Venezuela and Colombia (M. c. regulus), Ecuador and northern Peru (M. elata, M. castaneiceps, M. orientalis, M. c. chapmani), and central Peru and Bolivia (M. c. coronata). We found further population structure within M. c. regulus and M. c. coronata, and population structure and complexity of plumage variation within the Ecuador-northern Peru lineage. Time-calibrated trees estimated that most intraspecific variation originated during the Pleistocene; however, this pattern may not be attributed to an increase in diversification rate during that period. We discuss these results in the context of the importance of geographic-ecological barriers in promoting lineage diversification along the Andes and put forward a preliminary taxonomic proposal for major lineages identified in this study. © 2018 Prieto-Torres et al.

We fit for each spaceresolved element (pixel) an independent model where the SFH is averaged in 137 age bins, each one 100 Myr wide. We used the Bayesian Successive Priors (BSP) algorithm to mitigate the bias in the present-day spatial mass distribution. We test BSP with different prior probability distribution functions (PDFs); this exercise suggests that the best prior PDF is the one concordant with the spatial distribution of the stellar mass as inferred from the near-infrared images. We also demonstrate that varying the implicit prior PDF of the SFH in SSAG does not affect the results. By summing the contributions to the global star formation rate of each pixel, at each age bin, we have assembled the resolved SFH of the whole galaxy. According to these results, the star formation rate of M51a was exponentially increasing for the first 10 Gyr after the big bang, and then turned into an exponentially decreasing function until the present day. Superimposed, we find a main burst of star formation at t ≈ 11.9 Gyr after the big bang. © 2017 The Author(s).","<b>Effects of prior distributions: An application to pipedwater demand<\/b><br><br>In this paper, we analyze the effect on posterior parameter distributions of four possible alternative prior distributions, namely Normal-Inverse Gamma, Normal-Scaled Beta two, Student’s t-Inverse Gamma and Student’s t-Scaled Beta two. We show the effects of these prior distributions when there is apparently conflict between the sample information and the elicited hyperparameters. In particular, we show that there is not systematic differences of posterior parameter distributions associated with these four priors using data of piped water demand in a linear model with autoregressive errors. To test the hypothesis that this result is due to using a moderate sample size and a relatively high level of expert’s uncertainty, we perform some simulation exercises assuming smaller sample sizes and lower expert’s uncertainty. We obtain the general same pattern, although Student’s t models are slightly less affected by prior information when there is a high level of expert’s certainty, and Scaled Beta two models exhibit a higher level of posterior dispersion of the variance parameter. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2018.","<b>Multiple bayesian financial, to value shares of companies commerce commodities.

Currently, there are many fluctuations in the global economic environment and the demand and supply of assets or products act as a force that determines the prices according to which they are bought and sold, but sometimes, the price reflected in an action does not it reflects the price of generating value over time. Objective. Assess the performance and evolution of the financial multiples in the time of the company Ecopetrol de Colombia, projecting the price of the stock in the secondary market to five years. Material and methods.

To achieve this objective, new paradigms are necessary. The present work proposes an autonomic communication system, which uses a system of decision-making based on a Bayesian network, and a knowledge base based on an ontology, to take decisions of reconfiguration in the system. The main goal of the autonomic communication system is to adapt the communications platform to the characteristics of the context, in order to improve its performance. The ontology provides the knowledge about the performance factors and their relationships in the communication networks, to configure the structure of the Bayesian network. The Bayesian network is the stochastic reasoning mechanism used by the decision-making system. We present several tests on the NS2 simulator. In the tests carried out, we observe an improvement between 85% and 96% in the system performance, for scenarios where our approach of autonomic decision reconfigures the communication system. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

Bayesian clustering and genetic distance-based methods were used based on nine microsatellite loci in 377 individuals of three main putative species of the complex. The resulting genetic clusters were assessed for ecological niche divergence and areolar morphology, particularly spination patterns. We based our species boundaries on concordance between genetic, ecological, and morphological data, and were able to resolve four species, three of them corresponding to S. pruinosus from central Mexico, S. laevigatus from southern Mexico, and S. griseus from northern South America. A fourth species, previously considered to be S. griseus and commonly misidentified as S. pruinosus in northern Mexico showed significant genetic, ecological, and morphological differentiation suggesting that it should be considered a new species, S. huastecorum, which we describe here. We show that population genetic analyses, ecological niche modeling, and morphological studies are complementary approaches for delimiting species in taxonomically challenging plant groups such as the SGSC. © 2018 Alvarado-Sizzo et al.

Using a selection of physically motivated star formation histories, we set up a control sample of mock galaxy spectra representing observations of the local Universe in high-resolution spectroscopy, and in 56 narrow-band and 5 broad-band photometry. We fit the SEDs at these spectral resolutions and compute their corresponding stellar mass, the mass- and luminosity weighted age and metallicity, and the dust extinction. We study the biases, correlations and degeneracies affecting the retrieved parameters and explore the role of the spectral resolution and the SNR in regulating these degeneracies. We find that narrow-band photometry and spectroscopy yield similar trends in the physical properties derived, the former being considerably more precise. Using a galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we compare more realistically the results obtained from high-resolution and narrow-band SEDs (synthesized from the same SDSS spectra) following the same spectral fitting procedures. We use results from the literature as a benchmark to our spectroscopic estimates and showthat the prior probability distribution functions, commonly adopted in parametric methods, may introduce biases not accounted for in a Bayesian framework. We conclude that narrow-band photometry yields the same trend in the age-metallicity relation in the literature, provided it is affected by the same biases as spectroscopy, albeit the precision achieved with the latter is generally twice as large as with the narrow-band, at SNR values typical of the different kinds of data. © 2017 The Authors.","<b>Interactive effects of genotype x environment on the live weight of GIFT Nile tilapias<\/b><br><br>In this paper, the existence of a genotype x environment interaction for the average daily weight in GIFT Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in different regions in the state of Paraná (Brazil) was analyzed. The heritability results were high in the uni-characteristic analysis: 0.71, 0.72 and 0.67 for the cities of Palotina (PL), Floriano (FL) and Diamond North (DN), respectively. Genetic correlations estimated in bivariate analyzes were weak with values between 0.12 for PL-FL, 0.06 for PL and 0.23 for DN-FL-DN. The Spearman correlation values were low, which indicated a change in ranking in the selection of animals in different environments in the study. There was heterogeneity in the phenotypic variance among the three regions and heterogeneity in the residual variance between PL and DN. The direct genetic gain was greater for the region with a DN value gain of 198.24 g/generation, followed by FL (98.73 g/generation) and finally PL (98.73 g/generation). The indirect genetic gains were lower than 0.37 and greater than 0.02 g/generation. The evidence of the genotype x environment interaction was verified, which indicated the phenotypic heterogeneity of the variances among the three regions, weak genetic correlation and modified rankings in the different environments. © 2017, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

The method relies purely on statistical analysis of observations and Monte-Carlo simulations to define stellar overdensities in the data. It decontaminates the cluster color-magnitude diagrams and, using a revised version of the Bayesian isochrone fitting code of Ramírez-Siordia et al., estimates the ages of the clusters. Comparisons of our estimates with those from other surveys show the superiority of our method to extract and measure the ages of star clusters, even in the most crowded fields. An application of our method is shown for the high-resolution, multiband imaging of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We detect 4850 clusters in the 7 deg2 we surveyed, 3451 of which have not been reported before. Our findings suggest multiple epochs of star cluster formation, with the most probable occurring ∼310 Myr ago. Several of these events are consistent with the epochs of the interactions among the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, and the Galaxy, as predicted by N-body numerical simulations. Finally, the spatially resolved star cluster formation history may suggest an inside-out cluster formation scenario throughout the LMC, for the past 1 Gyr. © 2017. The American Astronomical Society.

Also, it is known that this mosquito-borne infection varies in space and time. However, when the data is spatially incomplete most popular spatio-temporal methods of analysis cannot be applied directly. In this paper, we develop a two step methodology to model the spatio-temporal dependence of malaria incidence on local rainfall, temperature, and humidity as well as the regional sea surface temperatures (SST) in the northern coast of Venezuela. First, we fit an autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) to the weekly data, and then, we adjust a linear separable spacial vectorial autoregressive model (VAR) to the residuals of the ARDL. Finally, the model parameters are tuned using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure derived from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Our results show that the best model to account for the variations of malaria incidence from 2001 to 2008 in 10 endemic Municipalities in North-Eastern Venezuela is a logit model that included the accumulated local precipitation in combination with the local maximum temperature of the preceding month as positive regressors. Additionally, we show that although malaria dynamics is highly heterogeneous in space, a detailed analysis of the estimated spatial parameters in our model yield important insights regarding the joint behavior of the disease incidence across the different counties in our study. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","<b>Phylogenetic relationships of Brazilian Mikania species (Asteraceae, Eupatorieae) based on multilocus DNA markers<\/b><br><br>Mikania (Eupatorieae, Asteraceae), with a pantropical distribution, has a highly defined and constant set of floral characters leading to its treatment as the sole representative of subtribe Mikaniinae. Several infrageneric classifications have been proposed for the genus, the last carried out in Brazil, where c. 204 species, mostly distributed in the Atlantic Forest domain, have been described. Studies of Mikania are scarce and, when available, the focus is only on species description. Reports on phylogenetic analysis of the genus are lacking. Here we used AFLP markers, nuclear (ITS and ETS) and plastid (rps16 intron) sequences to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of a group of species representing the taxonomic sections proposed for Brazilian Mikania spp. Analysis based on Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood showed no support for the proposed infrageneric classification based on morphological characters. Nonetheless, molecular data revealed the existence of two evolutionary lineages for the genus. Mikania micrantha was shown to be non-monophyletic. Divergence time estimation suggested the emergence of two main evolutionary lineages c. 6.0 My, during the Miocene.

A set of 21 microsatellites was used to investigate the genetic composition of 24 Creole goat breeds (910 animals) from 10 countries to estimate levels of genetic variability, infer population structure and understand genetic relationships among populations across the American continent. Three commercial transboundary breeds were included in the analyses to investigate admixture with Creole goats. Overall, the genetic diversity of Creole populations (mean number of alleles = 5.82 ± 1.14, observed heterozygosity = 0.585 ± 0.074) was moderate and slightly lower than what was detected in other studies with breeds from other regions. The Bayesian clustering analysis without prior information on source populations identified 22 breed clusters. Three groups comprised more than one population, namely from Brazil (Azul and Graúna; Moxotó and Repartida) and Argentina (Long and shorthair Chilluda, Pampeana Colorada and Angora-type goat). Substructure was found in Criolla Paraguaya. When prior information on sample origin was considered, 92% of the individuals were assigned to the source population (threshold q ≥ 0.700). Creole breeds are well-differentiated entities (mean coefficient of genetic differentiation = 0.111 ± 0.048, with the exception of isolated island populations). Dilution from admixture with commercial transboundary breeds appears to be negligible. Significant levels of inbreeding were detected (inbreeding coefficient > 0 in most Creole goat populations, P < 0.05). Our results provide a broad perspective on the extant genetic diversity of Creole goats, however further studies are needed to understand whether the observed geographical patterns of population structure may reflect the mode of goat colonization in the Americas. © 2017 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics","<b>Customer behavior in electronic commerce: A bayesian approach<\/b><br><br>Online shopping has increasingly replaced traditional retail shopping, as a large number of consumers have adopted it on a global scale. However, while it is well established in developed countries, e-commerce is still at an early stage in emerging markets, hence there is a need to unveil which factors contributes to its adoption. The main objective of this study is to integrate the theory of planned behavior, the theory of reasoned action, and the technology acceptance model using a Bayesian approach to determine the key predictors of online purchase intention among internet users in Colombia. The results demonstrate the pertinence of the theory of reasoned action and technology acceptance model, models to explain online purchase intention, confirming that the intention to purchase online is mostly determined by the attitudes to e-commerce which, in turn, are explained by perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and the subjective norm related to online shopping. © 2017 Universidad de Talca-Chile.","<b>Successful and unsuccessful response inhibitions differentially affect the effective connectivity between insular, presupplementary-motor, and striatal areas<\/b><br><br>Successful response inhibition depends upon the delay between the cues that signal a response and its subsequent inhibition. Previous studies report activity in the right presupplementary motor area (rPreSMA), right anterior insula (rAI), and the right striatum (rSTR) when subjects attempt to inhibit responses. Although these regions are anatomically connected, how they interact during successful and unsuccessful inhibitions has not been studied. In this work, we used a temporal prediction task, functional MRI, and dynamic causal modeling to solve this question. We found selective direct activation of both the rPreSMA and the rAI during successful and unsuccessful inhibitions which also were associated with opposite modulatory effects on insular-striatal and presupplementary-motor striatal descending connections. Moreover, inputs to the rPreSMA during successful inhibitions were propagated to the rAI whereas inputs to the rAI during unsuccessful inhibitions were propagated to the rPreSMA. We interpret that the direct perturbation in the rPreSMA and the modulation of the rPreSMA → rSTR connections would facilitate response inhibition whereas weak insular activity would cause response inhibition to fail despite the existence of strong rAI → rSTR modulations. We discuss that descending connections could be nonlinearly modulated via activity of either the right inferior frontal gyrus or the left anterior cingulate cortex. From a predictive coding perspective, rAI activity during successful and unsuccessful inhibition would signal interoceptive information when subjects unexpectedly need to change behaviors. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","<b>Discontinuous payoff option pricing by Mellin transform: A probabilistic approach<\/b><br><br>The Mellin transform technique is applied for solving the Black-Scholes equation with time-dependent parameters and discontinuous payoff. We show that the option pricing is equivalent to recovering a probability density function on the positive real axis based on its moments, which are integer or fractional Mellin transform values. Then the Mellin transform can be effectively inverted from a collection of appropriately chosen fractional (i.e. non-integer) moments by means of the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) method. An accurate option pricing is guaranteed by previous theoretical results about MaxEnt distributions constrained by fractional moments. We prove that typical drawbacks of other numerical techniques, such as Finite Difference schemes, are bypassed exploiting the Mellin transform properties. An example involving discretely monitored barrier options is illustrated and the accuracy, efficiency and time consuming are discussed. © 2016","<b>REMOVING BIASES in RESOLVED STELLAR MASS MAPS of GALAXY DISKS THROUGH SUCCESSIVE Bayesian MARGINALIZE<\/b><br><br>Stellar masses of galaxies are frequently obtained by fitting stellar population synthesis models to galaxy photometry or spectra. The state of the art method resolves spatial structures within a galaxy to assess the total stellar mass content. In comparison to unresolved studies, resolved methods yield, on average, higher fractions of stellar mass for galaxies. In this work we improve the current method in order to mitigate a bias related to the resolved spatial distribution derived for the mass. The bias consists in an apparent filamentary mass distribution and a spatial coincidence between mass structures and dust lanes near spiral arms. The improved method is based on iterative Bayesian marginalization, through a new algorithm we have named Bayesian Successive Priors (BSP). We have applied BSP to M51 and to a pilot sample of 90 spiral galaxies from the Ohio State University Bright Spiral Galaxy Survey. By quantitatively comparing both methods, we find that the average fraction of stellar mass missed by unresolved studies is only half what previously thought. In contrast with the previous method, the output BSP mass maps bear a better resemblance to near-infrared images. © 2017. The American Astronomical Society.

Therefore, some aspects of its distribution, habitat requirements, and abundance are mostly unknown; which makes a proper determination of its conservation status difficult. Considering that new techniques known as species distribution models (SDMs) allow us to estimate the suitable areas and the most important variables for the distribution of a species, we compiled water opossum occurrences and modeled its potential distribution on a continental scale. We performed a SDM for the water opossum using MaxEnt and assessed the extent of habitat loss (km2) and the importance of Protected Areas (PAs). We compared the suitability values within and outside PAs using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to evaluate the efficiency of PAs. The results obtained were compared with the IUCN historical water opossum's map. Additionally, we identified gaps in the potential distribution where for future surveys should be focused. We obtained models that describe the distribution of this species based on 292 occurrences with new information for 16 countries. Deforestation reduced the area of suitable habitat by ∼40 % and only ∼18 % corresponds to natural forest within PAs. Areas inside PAs showed higher suitability values (0.351 ± 0.276; P < 0.001) than areas outside them. We identified gaps within the distribution that need attention during future surveys such as the frontier between Venezuela and Guyana, the Amazonian region, and central-eastern Brazil. Our results showed areas absent in the IUCN's distribution map, indicating that it needs to be updated. Thus, we proposed a new tentative extent of the water opossum distribution information here obtained. We demonstrated that PAs included areas with high habitat suitability values for C. minimus, which could protect the water opossum in the medium and long-term. Modifications to the physicochemical characteristics of the habitat due to forest loss and fragmentation can considerably affect water opossum populations and reduce local diversity. Thus, the preservation of river ecosystems and surrounding areas represents a necessary step for the conservation of C. minimus. © 2017 Asociación Mexicana de Mastozoología, www.mastozoologiamexicana.org.","<b>The scaled beta2 distribution as a robust prior for scales<\/b><br><br>We put forward the Scaled Beta2 (SBeta2) as a flexible and tractable family for modeling scales in both hierarchical and non-hierarchical settings. Various sensible alternatives to the overuse of vague Inverted Gamma priors have been proposed, mainly for hierarchical models. Several of these alternatives are particular cases of the SBeta2 or can be well approximated by it. This family of distributions can be obtained in closed form as a Gamma scale mixture of Gamma distributions, as the Student distribution can be obtained as a Gamma scale mixture of Normal variables. Members of the SBeta2 family arise as intrinsic priors and as divergence based priors in diverse situations, hierarchical and non-hierarchical. The SBeta2 family unifies and generalizes different proposals in the Bayesian literature, and has numerous theoretical and practical advantages: It is flexible, its members can be lighter, as heavy or heavier tailed as the half-Cauchy, and different behaviors at the origin can be modeled. It has the reciprocality property, i.e if the variance parameter is in the family the precision also is. It is easy to simulate from, and can be embedded in a Gibbs sampling scheme. Short of not being conjugate, it is also amazingly tractable: When coupled with a conditional Cauchy prior for locations, the marginal prior for locations can be found explicitly as proportional to known transcendental functions, and for integer values of the hyperparameters an analytical closed form exists. Furthermore, for specific choices of the hyperparameters, the marginal is found to be an explicit \"horseshoe prior\", which are known to have excellent theoretical and practical properties. To our knowledge this is the first closed form horseshoe prior obtained. We also show that for certain values of the hyperparameters the mixture of a Normal and a Scaled Beta2 distribution also gives a closed form marginal. Examples include robust normal and binomial hierarchical modeling and metaanalysis, with real and simulated data. © 2017.

These signatures have been identified from high throughput sequencing data generated from cancer genomes by using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) techniques. Current methods based on optimization techniques are strongly sensitive to initial conditions due to high dimensionality and nonconvexity of the NMF paradigm. In this context, an important question consists in the determination of the actual number of signatures that best represent the data. The extraction of mutational signatures from high-throughput data still remains a daunting task. Results: Here we present a new method for the statistical estimation of mutational signatures based on an empirical Bayesian treatment of the NMF model. While requiring minimal intervention from the user, our method addresses the determination of the number of signatures directly as a model selection problem. In addition, we introduce two new concepts of significant clinical relevance for evaluating the mutational profile. The advantages brought by our approach are shown by the analysis of real and synthetic data. The later is used to compare our approach against two alternative methods mostly used in the literature and with the same NMF parametrization as the one considered here. Our approach is robust to initial conditions and more accurate than competing alternatives. It also estimates the correct number of signatures even when other methods fail. Results on real data agree well with current knowledge. © The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press.

Participants produce time intervals during the task, and the researcher explores how task performance affects interval production - where time estimation error is the dependent variable of interest. The perspective of predictive behavior regards time estimation error as a temporal prediction error (PE), an independent variable that controls cognition, behavior, and learning. Based on this perspective, we investigated whether temporal PEs affect short-term memory scanning. Participants performed temporal predictions while they maintained information in memory. Model inference revealed that PEs affected memory scanning response time independently of the memory-set size effect. We discuss the results within the context of formal and mechanistic models of short-term memory scanning and predictive coding, a Bayes-based theory of brain function. We state the hypothesis that our finding could be associated with weak frontostriatal connections and weak striatal activity. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.","<b>Spatio-temporal dynamic model and parallelized ensemble kalman filter for precipitation data<\/b><br><br>This paper presents a spatiotemporal dynamic model which allows Bayesian inference of precipitation states in some Venezuelan meteorological stations. One of the limitations that are reported in digital databases is the reliability of the records and the lack of information for certain days, weeks, or months. To complete the missing data, the Gibbs algorithm, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure, was used. A feature of precipitation series is that their distribution contains discrete and continuous components implying complicated dynamics. A model is proposed based on a discrete representation of a stochastic integro-difference equation. Given the difficulty of obtaining explicit analytical expressions for the predictive posterior distribution, approximations were obtained using a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm called the parallelized ensemble Kalman filter. The proposed method permits the completion of the missing data in the series where required and secondly allows the splitting of a large database into smaller ones for separate evaluation and eventual combination of the individual results. The objective is to reduce the dimension and computational cost in order to obtain models that are able to describe the reality in real time. It was shown that the obtained models are able to predict spatially and temporally the states of rainfall for at least three to four days quickly, efficiently and accurately. Three methods of statistical validation were used to evaluate the performance of the model and showed no significant discrepancies. Speedup and efficiency factors were calculated to compare the speed of calculation using the parallelized ensemble Kalman filter algorithm with the speed of the sequential version. The improvement in speed for four pthread executions was greatest. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2016.","<b>Autonomie decision making based on Bayesian networks and ontologies<\/b><br><br>In modern decision making systems, it is necessary to develop ways to optimize the decisions. To achieve this objective, new paradigms are necessary, as those linked to autonomic paradigm, which establishes, among other things, the self-configuration of the systems in order to improve their performances. On this basis, this paper proposes a system of autonomous decision, based on Bayesian networks and ontologies, to optimize and adapt a system to the characteristics of the context. The ontology provides the knowledge about the context to study, to configure the structure of the Bayesian network, while this latter is the stochastic reasoning mechanism used by the decision-making system. To verify the operation of our approach, it is used in an autonomic communication system. In the tests realized we could observe an improvement in the system performance. © 2016 IEEE.","<b>Forecast of Large Earthquakes Through Semi-periodicity Analysis of Labeled Point Processes: Semi-Periodicity Analysis of Large Earthquakes<\/b><br><br>Large earthquakes have semi-periodic behavior as a result of critically self-organized processes of stress accumulation and release in seismogenic regions. Hence, large earthquakes in a given region constitute semi-periodic sequences with recurrence times varying slightly from periodicity. In previous papers, it has been shown that it is possible to identify these sequences through Fourier analysis of the occurrence time series of large earthquakes from a given region, by realizing that not all earthquakes in the region need belong to the same sequence, since there can be more than one process of stress accumulation and release in the region. Sequence identification can be used to forecast earthquake occurrence with well determined confidence bounds. This paper presents improvements on the above mentioned sequence identification and forecasting method: the influence of earthquake size on the spectral analysis, and its importance in semi-periodic events identification are considered, which means that earthquake occurrence times are treated as a labeled point process; a revised estimation of non-randomness probability is used; a better estimation of appropriate upper limit uncertainties to use in forecasts is introduced; and the use of Bayesian analysis to evaluate the posterior forecast performance is applied. This improved method was successfully tested on synthetic data and subsequently applied to real data from some specific regions. As an example of application, we show the analysis of data from the northeastern Japan Arc region, in which one semi-periodic sequence of four earthquakes with M ≥ 8.0, having high non-randomness probability was identified. We compare the results of this analysis with those of the unlabeled point process analysis. © 2016, Springer International Publishing.","<b>Temporal uncertainty and temporal estimation errors affect insular activity and the frontostriatal indirect pathway during action update: A predictive coding study<\/b><br><br>Action update, substituting a prepotent behavior with a new action, allows the organism to counteract surprising environmental demands. However, action update fails when the organism is uncertain about when to release the substituting behavior, when it faces temporal uncertainty. Predictive coding states that accurate perception demands minimization of precise prediction errors. Activity of the right anterior insula (rAI) is associated with temporal uncertainty. Therefore, we hypothesize that temporal uncertainty during action update would cause the AI to decrease the sensitivity to ascending prediction errors. Moreover, action update requires response inhibition which recruits the frontostriatal indirect pathway associated with motor control. Therefore, we also hypothesize that temporal estimation errors modulate frontostriatal connections. To test these hypotheses, we collected fMRI data when participants performed an action-update paradigm within the context of temporal estimation. We fit dynamic causal models to the imaging data. Competing models comprised the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), right supramarginal gyrus (rSMG), rAI, right presupplementary motor area (rPreSMA), and the right striatum (rSTR). The winning model showed that temporal uncertainty drove activity into the rAI and decreased insular sensitivity to ascending prediction errors, as shown by weak connectivity strength of rSMG→rAI connections. Moreover, temporal estimation errors weakened rPreSMA→rSTR connections and also modulated rAI→rSTR connections, causing the disruption of action update. Results provide information about the neurophysiological implementation of the so-called horserace model of action control. We suggest that, contrary to what might be believed, unsuccessful action update could be a homeostatic process that represents a Bayes optimal encoding of uncertainty. © 2016 Limongi, Pérez, Modroño and González-Mora.","<b>Genetic relationships among American donkey populations: Insights into the process of colonization<\/b><br><br>This study presents the first insights into the genetic diversity and structure of the American donkey metapopulation. The primary objectives were to detect the main structural features underlying variability among American donkey populations, identify boundaries between differentiated gene pools, and draw the main colonization pathways since the introduction of donkeys into America in the 15th century. A panel of 14 microsatellite markers was applied for genotyping 350 American donkeys from 13 countries. The genetic structure of this metapopulation was analysed using descriptive statistics and Bayesian model-based methods. These populations were then compared to a database containing information on 476 individuals from 11 European breeds to identify the most likely ancestral donor populations. Results showed the presence of two distinct genetic pools, with confluence of the two in Colombia. The southern pool showed a unique genetic signature subsequent to an older founder event, but lacked any significant influence of modern gene flow from Europe. The northern pool, conversely, may have retained more ancestral polymorphisms and/or have experienced modern gene flow from Spanish breeds. The Andalusian and, to a lesser extent, the Catalan breeds have left a more pronounced footprint in some of the American donkey populations analysed. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","<b>Serodiagnosis of bovine trypanosomosis caused by non-tsetse transmitted Trypanosoma (Duttonella) vivax parasites using the soluble form of a Trypanozoon variant surface glycoprotein antigen<\/b><br><br>Previous studies have shown that a 64-kDa antigen (p64) that was purified from the Venezuelan TeAp-N/D1 isolate of Trypanosoma (Trypanozoon) equiperdum corresponds to the soluble form of its predominant variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), and exhibited cross-reactivity with Trypanosoma (Duttonella) vivax. The course of experimental acute infections of bovines with T. vivax were followed by measuring whole anti-p64 antibodies and specific anti-p64 IgG and IgM antibodies in animal sera by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The value of p64 to diagnose bovine trypanosomosis was also examined using 350 sera from healthy and T. vivax-infected cows living in a trypanosomosis-endemic and enzootic stable area, and 48 sera obtained during a trypanosomosis outbreak. Serological assays showed that ~70-80% of the infected sera contained anti-p64 antibodies, based on the comparative immunodetection of the T. equiperdum clarified antigenic fraction used as a reference test. In the absence of a gold standard, Bayesian analysis for multiple testing estimated a sensitivity and specificity of 71.6% and 98.8%, respectively, for the indirect ELISA using p64 as antigen. An apparent prevalence of 37.7% for bovine trypanosomosis infection was also estimated with a Bayesian approach when the p64 ELISA test was used. Employing blood from acute infected cows, the indirect ELISA response against p64 was contrasted with the microhematocrit centrifuge method and analyses by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers targeting the inter-specific length variation of the internal transcribed spacer 1 region of the 18S ribosomal gene. The efficiency of p64 for the detection of anti-trypanosome antibodies in acute infected bovines was also corroborated serologically by comparing its response to that of the Indonesian Trypanosoma evansi Rode Trypanozoon antigen type (RoTat) 1.2 VSG, which possesses high specificity and sensitivity. As expected, PCR was the best method to detect parasites and diagnose bovine trypanosomosis; however, a substantial level of concordance (Cohen's κ = 0.667) was obtained when serological tests using p64 and RoTat 1.2 VSG were compared. Additionally, an agglutination assay was designed using p64 covalently coupled to carboxylate-modified latex microparticles, which was proven here to be suitable for a fast qualitative diagnosis of bovine trypanosomosis. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Bayesian deconvolution of oil well test data using Gaussian processes<\/b><br><br>We use Bayesian methods to infer an unobserved function that is convolved with a known kernel.

This fact is used to obtain inferences regarding the unobserved process, effectively providing a deconvolution method. We apply the methodology to the problem of estimating the parameters of an oil reservoir from well-test pressure data. Here, the unknown process describes the structure of the well.

This approach, as well as the outputs, has a dynamic, nonstationary and nonparametric form, which circumvents the problem of model risk and parametric assumptions that the Kalman filter and other widely used approaches rely on. The by-product of clusters, used for shrinkage and information borrowing, can be of use to determine relationships around specific events. This approach exhibits a smaller Root Mean Squared Error than traditionally used benchmarks in financial settings, which we illustrate through simulation. As an illustration, we use hedge fund index data, and find that our estimated alphas are, on average, 0.13% per month higher (1.6% per year) than alphas estimated through Ordinary Least Squares. The approach exhibits fast adaptation to abrupt changes in the parameters, as seen in our estimated alphas and betas, which exhibit high volatility, especially in periods which can be identified as times of stressful market events, a reflection of the dynamic positioning of hedge fund portfolio managers. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","<b>Timing foreign exchange markets<\/b><br><br>To improve short-horizon exchange rate forecasts, we employ foreign exchange market risk factors as fundamentals, and Bayesian treed Gaussian process (BTGP) models to handle non-linear, time-varying relationships between these fundamentals and exchange rates. Forecasts from the BTGP model conditional on the carry and dollar factors dominate random walk forecasts on accuracy and economic criteria in the Meese-Rogoff setting. Superior market timing ability for large moves, more than directional accuracy, drives the BTGP’s success. We explain how, through a model averaging Monte Carlo scheme, the BTGP is able to simultaneously exploit smoothness and rough breaks in between-variable dynamics. Either feature in isolation is unable to consistently outperform benchmarks throughout the full span of time in our forecasting exercises. Trading strategies based on ex ante BTGP forecasts deliver the highest out-of-sample risk-adjusted returns for the median currency, as well as for both predictable, traded risk factors. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","<b>Acceleration of the Finite-Element Gaussian Belief Propagation Solver Using Minimum Residual Techniques<\/b><br><br>The finite-element Gaussian belief propagation (FGaBP) method, introduced recently, provides a powerful alternative to the conventional finite-element method solvers to efficiently utilize high-performance computing platforms.

Here we build upon a recent molecular phylogeny of this subfamily to investigate the phylogenetic placement of Rugosus García, 2001, a genus comprising two species from the Guiana Shield region of Venezuela. We sequenced one mitochondrial and one nuclear gene fragment of Rugosus emarginatus García, as well as a specimen of Aglymbus leprieurii Aubé from Guyana in order to reassess the phylogenetic placement of the genus in the subfamily Copelatinae. Bayesian Inference analyses unambiguously indicate that Rugosus is nested within Aglymbus Sharp, 1880. As a result, Rugosus is synonymized with Aglymbus. Based on these results and on recent collecting data, the distribution of Aglymbus now includes Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. High-resolution images of the holotype specimens and labels of Aglymbus emarginatus (García), new combination and Aglymbus pubis (García), new combination are provided, as well as comments on the habitat of species in the \"A. leprieurii species-group\" of Aglymbus.","<b>A comprehensive comparative test of seven widely used spectral synthesis models against multi-band photometry of young massive-star clusters<\/b><br><br>We test the predictions of spectral synthesis models based on seven different massive-star prescriptions against Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) observations of eight young massive clusters in two local galaxies, NGC 1566 and NGC 5253, chosen because predictions of all seven models are available at the published galactic metallicities. The high angular resolution, extensive cluster inventory, and full near-ultraviolet to near-infrared photometric coverage make the LEGUS data set excellent for this study. We account for both stellar and nebular emission in the models and try two different prescriptions for attenuation by dust. From Bayesian fits of model libraries to the observations, we find remarkably low dispersion in the median E(B - V) (~0.03 mag), stellar masses (~104M⊙), and ages (~1Myr) derived for individual clusters using different models, although maximum discrepancies in these quantities can reach 0.09 mag and factors of 2.8 and 2.5, respectively. This is for ranges in median properties of 0.05-0.54 mag, 1.8-10 × 104M⊙, and 1.6-40 Myr spanned by the clusters in our sample. In terms of best fit, the observations are slightly better reproduced by models with interacting binaries and least well reproduced by models with single rotating stars. Our study provides a first quantitative estimate of the accuracies and uncertainties of the most recent spectral synthesis models of young stellar populations, demonstrates the good progress of models in fitting high-quality observations, and highlights the needs for a larger cluster sample and more extensive tests of the model parameter space. © 2016 The Authors.

Press] and clearly exposed by DeGroot [Probability and Statistics (1975) Addison-Wesley], with the aim of developing an approach that is attractive to all schools of statistics, resulting in a procedure better suited to the needs of science. The essential idea is to base testing statistical hypotheses on minimizing a weighted sum of type I and type II error probabilities instead of the prevailing paradigm, which is fixing type I error probability and minimizing type II error probability. For simple vs simple hypotheses, the optimal criterion is to reject the null using the likelihood ratio as the evidence (ordering) statistic, with a fixed threshold value instead of a fixed tail probability. By defining expected type I and type II error probabilities, we generalize the weighting approach and find that the optimal region is defined by the evidence ratio, that is, a ratio of averaged likelihoods (with respect to a prior measure) and a fixed threshold. This approach yields an optimal theory in complete generality, which the classical theory of testing does not. This can be seen as a Bayesian/non-Bayesian compromise: using a weighted sum of type I and type II error probabilities is Frequentist, but basing the test criterion on a ratio of marginalized likelihoods is Bayesian. We give arguments to push the theory still further, so that the weighting measures (priors) of the likelihoods do not have to be proper and highly informative, but just “well calibrated.” That is, priors that give rise to the same evidence (marginal likelihoods) using minimal (smallest) training samples. The theory that emerges, similar to the theories based on objective Bayesian approaches, is a powerful response to criticisms of the prevailing approach of hypothesis testing.

In this work we show however that probabilistic beliefs can be maintained in factored form exactly and efficiently across a number of causally closed beams, when the state variables that appear in more than one beam obey a form of backward determinism. Since computing marginals from the factors is still computationally intractable in general, and variables appearing in several beams are not always backward-deterministic, the basic formulation is extended with two approximations: forms of belief propagation for computing marginals from factors, and sampling of non-backward-deterministic variables for making such variables backwarddeterministic given their sampled history. Unlike, Rao-Blackwellized particle-filtering, the sampling is not used for making inference tractable but for making the factorization sound. The resulting algorithm involves sampling and belief propagation or just one of them as determined by the structure of the model.","<b>Response of the endangered tropical dry forests to climate change and the role of Mexican Protected Areas for their conservation<\/b><br><br>Assuming that co-distributed species are exposed to similar environmental conditions, ecological niche models (ENMs) of bird and plant species inhabiting tropical dry forests (TDFs) in Mexico were developed to evaluate future projections of their distribution for the years 2050 and 2070. We used ENM-based predictions and climatic data for two Global Climate Models, considering two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP4.5/RCP8.5). We also evaluated the effects of habitat loss and the importance of the Mexican system of protected areas (PAs) on the projected models for a more detailed prediction of TDFs and to identify hot spots that require conservation actions. We identified four major distributional areas: the main one located along the Pacific Coast (from Sonora to Chiapas, including the Cape and Bajío regions, and the Balsas river basin), and three isolated areas: the Yucatán peninsula, central Veracruz, and southern Tamaulipas. When considering the effect of habitat loss, a significant reduction (~61%) of the TDFs predicted area occurred, whereas climate-change models suggested (in comparison with the present distribution model) an increase in area of 3.0-10.0% and 3.0-9.0% for 2050 and 2070, respectively. In future scenarios, TDFs will occupy areas above its current average elevational distribution that are outside of its present geographical range. Our findings show that TDFs may persist in Mexican territory until the middle of the XXI century; however, the challenges about long-term conservation are partially addressed (only 7% unaffected within the Mexican network of PAs) with the current Mexican PAs network. Based on our ENM approach, we suggest that a combination of models of species inhabiting present TDFs and taking into account change scenarios represent an invaluable tool to create new PAs and ecological corridors, as a response to the increasing levels of habitat destruction and the effects of climate change on this ecosystem. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","<b>Population genetics of the speckled peacock bass (Cichla temensis), South America’s most important inland sport fishery<\/b><br><br>The Neotropics harbor the world’s most diverse freshwater fish fauna, with many of these species supporting major commercial, subsistence, or sport fisheries. Knowledge of population genetic structure is available for very few Neotropical fishes, thereby restricting management. To address this need, we examined population genetic variation in mtDNA control region sequences and twelve microsatellite loci in the speckled or barred peacock bass, Cichla temensis. Moderate and statistically significant genetic divergence among localities indicates that migration is low in this species, implying that populations inhabiting tributaries or even smaller spatial units should constitute management units. Analysis of molecular variance of mtDNA sequences identified six areas with largely exclusive haplotype clades, and a seventh area of high admixture, but major drainage basins harbored non-monophyletic haplotype groups. On the other hand, molecular variation in the microsatellite data was best explained by drainage basin and, subsequently, by the seven areas. Populations in these seven areas could be considered evolutionarily significant units (ESUs), and, therefore, we tested hypotheses explaining the discordant signal of mtDNA and microsatellite data using approximate Bayesian computation. This analysis indicated that the divergence of mtDNA clades preceded the divergence of contemporary ESUs across basins, with subsequent lineage sorting among ESUs due to reduced gene flow. Available genetic and ecological information indicates that C. temensis populations of major tributary rivers should be managed as separate stocks that likely are adapted to local environmental conditions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","<b>Haar wavelet transform and principal component analysis for fetal QRS classification from abdominal maternal ECG recordings<\/b><br><br>Fetal heart rate monitoring plays an essential role in helping to decrease the perinatal mortality rate associated with abnormalities in the cardiovascular system of the fetus. In this sense, a new approach to detect fetal QRS (fQRS) complexes from abdominal maternal ECG signals is proposed in this paper. First, signals were segmented into contiguous frames of 250 ms duration and then labeled in four classes. Principal component analysis was applied on Haar-Wavelet transform for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, and interquartile ranges and sampling without replacement were employed to deal with outliers and imbalanced class problems, respectively. K-nearest neighborhood (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and Bayesian network (BN) were trained and tested on the ECG signals of four electrodes of the PhysioNet/CinC challenge 2013 dataset, using 10-fold stratified cross-validation. Results show that KNN and SVM got better average accuracies over BN, that reach to 89.59% and 89.19%, respectively. Although KNN yielded better results, SVM was less time-consuming in prediction. In addition, the fourth electrode signals are less noisy and contain more representative data that helps SVM reaches an accuracy about 80% for fQRS estimation. © 2015 IEEE.","<b>Reservoir uncertainty description via petrophysical inversion of seismic data<\/b><br><br>Hydrocarbon reservoir characterization commonly combines seismic, petrophysical, and well-log information in a variety of procedures. As an inference problem, this combination can be formulated in a unified inverse framework, reducing the bias of nonlinear relationships among intermediate variables and providing a comprehensive calculation of uncertainties at final estimates of the medium parameters. In addition, the unified formulation leads to the joint estimation of reservoir and medium elastic properties as well as related parameters of interests. This problem is formulated from a set of continuous variables that commonly characterizes the reservoir (total porosity, shale volume fraction, and water saturation), which can be related to the medium mechanical properties with a petrophysical model calibrated to the specific setting of the reservoir and target stratum. The joint model property configuration is related to the observed seismic data via Zoeppritz incidence-angle-dependent reflectivity and convolution with a source wavelet for each CDP gather. Data and calibrated information are combined in a posterior probability density of the model parameters that is evaluated with a sampling approach, using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm. From a large number of realizations, one can calculate expected values and full marginal probability distributions for reservoir properties and elastic properties. The method is illustrated with the estimation of reservoir parameters at a gas reservoir presenting a Class 2 AVA response, with focus on the estimation of water saturation. The calculated saturation probability distributions show coherent results with the known saturation at various well locations. © 2015, Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

Although the species has been registered in several localities, its geographic distribution remains unclear, and the effects of climate change and current land uses on this species are largely unknown. We modeled the ecological niche of T. pinchaque using MaxEnt, in order to assess its potential adaptation to present and future climate change scenarios. We evaluated the effects of habitat loss due by current land use, the ecosystem availability and importance of Ecuadorian System of Protected Areas into the models. The model of environmental suitability estimated an extent of occurrence for species of 21,729 km2 in all of Ecuador, mainly occurring along the corridor of the eastern Ecuadorian Andes. A total of 10 Andean ecosystems encompassed ~98% of the area defined by the model, with herbaceous paramo, northeastern Andean montane evergreen forest and northeastern Andes upper montane evergreen forest being the most representative. When considering the effect of habitat loss, a significant reduction in model area (~17%) occurred, and the effect of climate change represented a net reduction up to 37.86%. However, the synergistic effect of both climate change and habitat loss, given current land use practices, could represent a greater risk in the short-term, leading to a net reduction of 19.90 to 44.65% in T. pinchaque's potential distribution. Even under such a scenarios, several Protected Areas harbor a portion (~36 to 48%) of the potential distribution defined by the models. However, the central and southern populations are highly threatened by habitat loss and climate change. Based on these results and due to the restricted home range of T. pinchaque, its preference for upland forests and paramos, and its small estimated population size in the Andes, we suggest to maintaining its current status as Critically Endangered in Ecuador. © 2015 Ortega-Andrade et al.","<b>Detection of segments with fetal QRS complex from abdominal maternal ECG recordings using support vector machine<\/b><br><br>This paper introduces a robust method based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to detect the presence of Fetal QRS (fQRS) complexes in electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provided by the PhysioNet/CinC challenge 2013. ECG signals are first segmented into contiguous frames of 250 ms duration and then labeled in six classes. Fetal segments are tagged according to the position of fQRS complex within each one. Next, segment features extraction and dimensionality reduction are obtained by applying principal component analysis on Haar-wavelet transform. After that, two sub-datasets are generated to separate representative segments from atypical ones. Imbalanced class problem is dealt by applying sampling without replacement on each sub-dataset. Finally, two SVMs are trained and cross-validated using the two balanced sub-datasets separately.

Sequence analyses revealed genetic differentiation among subpopulations with the largest genetic distance occurring between subpopulations of Europe and Canada and/or South America. Bayesian analysis indicated the presence of three ancestral population clusters. Mismatch distribution displayed signatures characteristic of changes in size due to demographic and spatial expansions in the overall Y. ruckeri population, and also in the geographically separate subpopulations. Furthermore, a weak signal of isolation by distance was determined. A significant positive correlation between genetic and geographical distances was observed. These results revealed that the population of Y. ruckeri has undergone both ancient and recent population changes that were probably induced by biogeography forces in the past and, much more recently, by adaptive processes forced by aquaculture expansion. These findings have important implications for future studies on Y. ruckeri population dynamics, on the potential role of genetic structure to explain variations in ERM transmission, and on the effect of past evolutionary events on current estimations of gene flow. © 2015 Bastardo, Ravelo and Romalde.","<b>A bayesian beta Markov random field calibration of the term structure of implied risk neutral densities<\/b><br><br>We build on the derivative pricing calibration literature, and propose a more general calibration model for implied risk neutral densities.

Tepuis hold enormous endemicity levels, but little is known about the origins of the endemic flora and fauna. Recently diverged lineages offer the possibility of understanding the origins of summit endemicity by examining population dynamics and dispersal. We examine species delimitation, clade relationships, and demographic patterns of three recently diverged lineages of Tepuihyla, an endemic treefrog clade. These three lineages represent two currently recognized species, T. edelcae and T. rodriguezi. Given the low divergences in both nuclear and mitochondrial genes among lineages, we find unexpectedly high numbers of unique nuclear haplotypes and moderate levels of lineage sorting. We also find support from multiple analyses for a cryptic, undescribed summit species within T. edelcae. We suggest that the genetic and distribution patterns of the four most recently diverged Tepuihyla lineages support a concurrent speciation event during the Pliocene, and suggest a biogeographic hypothesis in which a widespread climatic change made mid- and low-elevation habitat unsuitable for the common ancestor within the timeframe of their divergence. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Genetic parameters and morphometric characteristics of two generations from the GIFT strain of the Nile Tilapia<\/b><br><br>The objective of this work was to estimate the (co)variance and the genetic parameters for weight and average daily gain from two national generations of the GIFT strain of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus).

The estimates of heritability using one-trait models for weight was 0.15, average daily gain was 0.19, fish length was 0.23, fish width was 0.19, standard length was 0.17, fish height was 0.15, and the head length was 0.17. The genetic and phenotypic correlations were above 0.68 and 0.95, respectively. The values of Spearman and Pearson correlations for breeding values of the morphometric traits in relation to average daily gain ranged from 0.58 to 0.98 and from 0.63 to 0.99, respectively. In the second generation (G2), the genetic gain was 2.6%, the effective size of the population was 94, and the inbreeding coefficient was 0.005. In the next generation (G3), these values were 8.1%, 124 and 0.004, respectively. The genetic gains over the generations gradually increased from one generation to another, indicating that the criterion, average daily gain, chosen for feature selection was efficient.","<b>Global invasion of Lantana camara: Has the climatic niche been conserved across continents?<\/b><br><br>Lantana camara, a native plant from tropical America, is considered one of the most harmful invasive species worldwide. Several studies have identified potentially invasible areas under scenarios of global change, on the assumption that niche is conserved during the invasion process. Recent studies, however, suggest that many invasive plants do not conserve their niches. Using Principal Components Analyses (PCA), we tested the hypothesis of niche conservatism for L. camara by comparing its native niche in South America with its expressed niche in Africa, Australia and India. Using MaxEnt, the estimated niche for the native region was projected onto each invaded region to generate potential distributions there. Our results demonstrate that while L. camara occupied subsets of its original native niche in Africa and Australia, in India its niche shifted significantly. There, 34% of the occurrences were detected in warmer habitats nonexistent in its native range. The estimated niche for India was also projected onto Africa and Australia to identify other vulnerable areas predicted from the observed niche shift detected in India. As a result, new potentially invasible areas were identified in central Africa and southern Australia. Our findings do not support the hypothesis of niche conservatism for the invasion of L. camara . The mechanisms that allow this species to expand its niche need to be investigated in order to improve our capacity to predict long-term geographic changes in the face of global climatic changes. ©2014 Goncalves et al.","<b>Polyphyly, gene-duplication and extensive allopolyploidy framed the evolution of the ephemeral Vulpia grasses and other fine-leaved Loliinae (Poaceae)<\/b><br><br>The fine-leaved Loliinae is one of the temperate grass lineages that is richest in number of evolutionary switches from perennial to annual life-cycle, and also shows one of the most complex reticulate patterns involving distinct diploid and allopolyploid lineages. Eight distinct annual lineages, that have traditionally been placed in the genus Vulpia and in other fine-leaved ephemeral genera, have apparently emerged from different perennial Festuca ancestors. The phenotypically similar Vulpia taxa have been reconstructed as polyphyletic, with polyploid lineages showing unclear relationships to their purported diploid relatives. Interspecific and intergeneric hybridization is, however, rampant across different lineages. An evolutionary analysis based on cloned nuclear low-copy GBSSI (Granule-Bound Starch Synthase I) and multicopy ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) sequences has been conducted on representatives of most Vulpia species and other fine-leaved lineages, using Bayesian consensus and agreement trees, networking split graphs and species tree-based approaches, to disentangle their phylogenetic relationships and to identify the parental genome donors of the allopolyploids. Both data sets were able to reconstruct a congruent phylogeny in which Vulpia was resolved as polyphyletic from at least three main ancestral diploid lineages. These, in turn, participated in the origin of the derived allopolyploid Vulpia lineages together with other Festuca-like, Psilurus-like and some unknown genome donors. Long-distance dispersal events were inferred to explain the polytopic origin of the Mediterranean and American Vulpia lineages. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Comparative population genetics and evolutionary history of two commonly misidentified billfishes of management and conservation concern<\/b><br><br>Background: Misidentifications between exploited species may lead to inaccuracies in population assessments, with potentially irreversible conservation ramifications if overexploitation of either species is occurring. A notable showcase is provided by the realization that the roundscale spearfish (Tetrapturus georgii), a recently validated species, has been historically misidentified as the morphologically very similar and severely overfished white marlin (Kajikia albida) (IUCN listing: Vulnerable). In effect, no information exists on the population status and evolutionary history of the enigmatic roundscale spearfish, a large, highly vagile and broadly distributed pelagic species. We provide the first population genetic evaluation of the roundscale spearfish, utilizing nuclear microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA sequence markers. Furthermore, we re-evaluated existing white marlin mitochondrial genetic data and present our findings in a comparative context to the roundscale spearfish. Results: Microsatellite and mitochondrial (control region) DNA markers provided mixed evidence for roundscale spearfish population differentiation between the western north and south Atlantic regions, depending on marker-statistical analysis combination used. Mitochondrial DNA analyses provided strong signals of historical population growth for both white marlin and roundscale spearfish, but higher genetic diversity and effective female population size (1.5-1.9X) for white marlin. Conclusions: The equivocal indications of roundscale spearfish population structure, combined with a smaller effective female population size compared to the white marlin, already a species of concern, suggests that a species-specific and precautionary management strategy recognizing two management units is prudent for this newly validated billfish. © 2014 Bernard et al.","<b>Metropolis - Hasting and gibbs by blocks: Use of markov chain monte carlo algorithms to model stratigraphic columns, Lama Field, Maracaibo Lake<\/b><br><br>In this article we stochastically characterize a reservoir through the modeling of stratigraphic columns using two algorithms: Metropolis-Hasting and Gibbs sampling by blocks; both constitute Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The stratigraphic unit considered corresponds to the C4 sands of the Misoa Formation, on Lama Field, at the Maracaibo Lake, consisting of inter-bedded sandstones with scarce intercalations of siltstone and shale. Using the information of 11 wells located in the study area, 20 new pseudo-columns were modeled in new locations by means of both algorithms. Combining the information of real columns and the estimated ones, maps of sand content were generated. The Metropolis-Hasting algorithm reproduced, mainly, the presence of sands along the pseudo-sequences generated, which represent more than 70% of the sediment present in the study area. This algorithm suggests the areas where the main variations of sand content could occur, but does not seem to be sensible enough to detect the facies variations of silt and clay. The maps obtained with the Gibbs-by-block algorithm, like that using Metropolis-Hasting, clearly show a NE-SW trend in sand content which correlate with the results of previous works in the area. Furthermore, the Gibbs-by-block algorithm developed here is capable of reproducing the presence of fine layers of the other lithologies observed in the area, if a geologically well thought-out length for the block is used.","<b>Electrical energy conversion system design with single-phase inverter and H5 transformerless topology<\/b><br><br>This paper presents the design of an electrical energy conversion system (EECS) for the use of solar energy and its conditioning for injection of energy to the commercial power grid.

These priors may have heavier tails than Student-t priors, and the variances have a sensible behaviour both at the origin and at the tail, making it suitable for objective analysis. Since the representation of our proposal is a scale mixture, it is suitable to detect sudden changes in the model. Finally, we propose a Gibbs sampler using this new family of priors for modelling outliers and structural breaks in Bayesian dynamic linear models. We demonstrate in a published example, that our proposal is more suitable than the Inverted Gamma's assumption for the variances, which makes very hard to detect structural changes. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2014.","<b>The influence of the complex topography and dynamic history of the montane Neotropics on the evolutionary differentiation of a cloud forest bird (Premnoplex brunnescens, Furnariidae)<\/b><br><br>Aim: To examine the effect of geographical barriers and habitat dynamics related to climatic oscillations on the phylogeography of a widespread passerine of Neotropical cloud forests, the spotted barbtail (Premnoplex brunnescens). Location: Neotropical humid forests of montane areas in lower Central America and South America. Methods: We sequenced two mitochondrial genes and one nuclear intron from specimens collected across the distribution of P. brunnescens. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using Bayesian and maximum-likelihood methods. Groups with maximum differentiation were estimated with spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA). We estimated timing of differentiation and relationships among groups with a species-tree approach and historical demography with extended Bayesian skyline plots. Results: Six highly differentiated clades of P. brunnescens are distributed in lower Central America, Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, northern Venezuelan mountains, the Northern Andes, central Peru, and southern Peru and Bolivia. Within the Northern Andes clade, six phylogroups were identified associated with different slopes and isolated cordilleras. Most clades occupy opposite sides of low-lying valleys and ridgelines, but little differentiation was observed across several putative barriers. Population divergence occurred in the late Miocene and Pliocene, perhaps in association with Andean uplift. Historical fluctuations in population sizes suggest that populations tracked the spatial dynamics of montane forests associated with glacial cycles. Main conclusions: Extensive genetic differentiation in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA exists among populations of P. brunnescens. Such marked divergence was probably promoted by the rugged topography and dynamic ecological history of the Neotropical mountains. Our study sheds light on mechanisms promoting population differentiation in the montane Neotropics. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","<b>Exchange rate fundamentals, forecasting, and speculation: Bayesian models in black markets<\/b><br><br>Although speculative activity is central to black markets for currency, the out-of-sample performance of structural models in those settings is unknown.

In recent years, the systematics of this clade, which contains more than 7000 species, has developed rapidly in light of new studies combining molecular and morphological observations. We add more than 500 new, nearly complete 18S sequences (an increase of more than 200%) in an attempt to further enhance understanding of the phylogeny of Demospongiae. Our study specifically targets representation of type species and genera that have never been sampled for any molecular data in an effort to accelerate progress in classifying this diverse lineage. Our analyses recover four highly supported subclasses of Demospongiae: Keratosa, Myxospongiae, Haploscleromorpha, and Heteroscleromorpha. Within Keratosa, neither Dendroceratida, nor its two families, Darwinellidae and Dictyodendrillidae, are monophyletic and Dictyoceratida is divided into two lineages, one predominantly composed of Dysideidae and the second containing the remaining families (Irciniidae, Spongiidae, Thorectidae, and Verticillitidae). Within Myxospongiae, we find Chondrosida to be paraphyletic with respect to the Verongida. We amend the latter to include species of the genus Chondrosia and erect a new order Chondrillida to contain remaining taxa from Chondrosida, which we now discard. Even with increased taxon sampling of Haploscleromorpha, our analyses are consistent with previous studies; however, Haliclona species are interspersed in even more clades. Haploscleromorpha contains five highly supported clades, each more diverse than previously recognized, and current families are mostly polyphyletic. In addition, we reassign Janulum spinispiculum to Haploscleromorpha and resurrect Reniera filholi as Janulum filholi comb. nov. Within the large clade Heteroscleromorpha, we confirmed 12 recently identified clades based on alternative data, as well as a sister-group relationship between the freshwater Spongillida and the family Vetulinidae. We transfer Stylissa flabelliformis to the genus Scopalina within the family Scopalinidae, which is of uncertain position. Our analyses uncover a large, strongly supported clade containing all heteroscleromorphs other than Spongillida, Vetulinidae, and Scopalinidae. Within this clade, there is a major division separating Axinellidae, Biemnida, Tetractinellida, Bubaridae, Stelligeridae, Raspailiidae, and some species of Petromica, Topsentia, and Axinyssa from Agelasida, Polymastiidae, Placospongiidae, Clionaidae, Spirastrellidae, Tethyidae, Poecilosclerida, Halichondriidae, Suberitidae, and Trachycladus. Among numerous results: (1) Spirophorina and its family Tetillidae are paraphyletic with respect to a strongly supported Astrophorina within Tetractinellida; (2) Agelasida is the earliest diverging lineage within the second clade listed above; and (3) Merlia and Desmacella appear to be the earliest diverging lineages of Poecilosclerida. © 2013 Published by Oxford University Press.","<b>Nearly complete 28S rRNA gene sequences confirm new hypotheses of sponge evolution<\/b><br><br>The highly collaborative research sponsored by the NSF-funded Assembling the Porifera Tree of Life (PorToL) project is providing insights into some of the most difficult questions in metazoan systematics. Our understanding of phylogenetic relationships within the phylum Porifera has changed considerably with increased taxon sampling and data from additional molecular markers. PorToL researchers have falsified earlier phylogenetic hypotheses, discovered novel phylogenetic alliances, found phylogenetic homes for enigmatic taxa, and provided a more precise understanding of the evolution of skeletal features, secondary metabolites, body organization, and symbioses. Some of these exciting new discoveries are shared in the papers that form this issue of Integrative and Comparative Biology. Our analyses of over 300 nearly complete 28S ribosomal subunit gene sequences provide specific case studies that illustrate how our dataset confirms new hypotheses of sponge evolution. We recovered monophyletic clades for all 4 classes of sponges, as well as the 4 major clades of Demospongiae (Keratosa, Myxospongiae, Haploscleromorpha, and Heteroscleromorpha), but our phylogeny differs in several aspects from traditional classifications. In most major clades of sponges, families within orders appear to be paraphyletic. Although additional sampling of genes and taxa are needed to establish whether this pattern results from a lack of phylogenetic resolution or from a paraphyletic classification system, many of our results are congruent with those obtained from 18S ribosomal subunit gene sequences and complete mitochondrial genomes. These data provide further support for a revision of the traditional classification of sponges. © 2013 The Author.","<b>Temporal prediction errors modulate cingulate-insular coupling<\/b><br><br>Prediction error (i.e., the difference between the expected and the actual event's outcome) mediates adaptive behavior. Activity in the anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC) and in the anterior insula (aINS) is associated with the commission of prediction errors under uncertainty. We propose a dynamic causal model of effective connectivity (i.e., neuronal coupling) between the aMCC, the aINS, and the striatum in which the task context drives activity in the aINS and the temporal prediction errors modulate extrinsic cingulate-insular connections. With functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 15 participants when they performed a temporal prediction task. They observed visual animations and predicted when a stationary ball began moving after being contacted by another moving ball. To induced uncertainty-driven prediction errors, we introduced spatial gaps and temporal delays between the balls. Classical and Bayesian fMRI analyses provided evidence to support that the aMCC-aINS system along with the striatum not only responds when humans predict whether a dynamic event occurs but also when it occurs. Our results reveal that the insula is the entry port of a three-region pathway involved in the processing of temporal predictions. Moreover, prediction errors rather than attentional demands, task difficulty, or task duration exert an influence in the aMCC-aINS system. Prediction errors debilitate the effect of the aMCC on the aINS. Finally, our computational model provides a way forward to characterize the physiological parallel of temporal prediction errors elicited in dynamic tasks. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Bayesian space-time modeling of malaria incidence in Sucre state, Venezuela: SPATIAL SPECIAL ISSUE<\/b><br><br>Malaria is a parasitic infectious tropical disease that causes high mortality rates in the tropical belt. In Venezuela, Sucre state is considered the third state with most disease prevalence. This paper presents a hierarchical regression log-Poisson space-time model within a Bayesian approach to represent the incidence of malaria in Sucre state, Venezuela, during the period 1990-2002 in 15 municipalities of the state. Several additive models for the logarithm of the relative risk of the disease for each district were considered. These models differ in their structure by including different combinations of social-economic and climatic covariates in a multiple regression term. A random effect that captures the spatial heterogeneity in the study region, and a CAR (Conditionally Autoregressive) component that recognizes the effect of nearby municipalities in the transmission of the disease each year, are also included in the model. A simpler version without including the CAR component was also fitted to the data. Model estimation and predictive inference was carried out through the implementation of a computer code in the WinBUGS software, which makes use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. For model selection the criterion of minimum posterior predictive loss (D) was used. The Moran I statistic was calculated to test the independence of the residuals of the resulting model. Finally, we verify the model fit by using the Bayesian p-value, and in most cases the selected model captures the spatial structure of the relative risks among the neighboring municipalities each year. For years with a poor model fit, the t-Student distribution is used as an alternative model for the spatial local random effect with better fit to the tail behavior of the data probability distribution. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","<b>Reconstruction of Family-Level Phylogenetic Relationships within Demospongiae (Porifera) Using Nuclear Encoded Housekeeping Genes<\/b><br><br>Background: Demosponges are challenging for phylogenetic systematics because of their plastic and relatively simple morphologies and many deep divergences between major clades. To improve understanding of the phylogenetic relationships within Demospongiae, we sequenced and analyzed seven nuclear housekeeping genes involved in a variety of cellular functions from a diverse group of sponges. Methodology/Principal Findings: We generated data from each of the four sponge classes (i.e., Calcarea, Demospongiae, Hexactinellida, and Homoscleromorpha), but focused on family-level relationships within demosponges. With data for 21 newly sampled families, our Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian-based approaches recovered previously phylogenetically defined taxa: Keratosap, Myxospongiaep, Spongillidap, Haploscleromorphap (the marine haplosclerids) and Democlaviap. We found conflicting results concerning the relationships of Keratosap and Myxospongiaep to the remaining demosponges, but our results strongly supported a clade of Haploscleromorphap+Spongillidap+Democlaviap. In contrast to hypotheses based on mitochondrial genome and ribosomal data, nuclear housekeeping gene data suggested that freshwater sponges (Spongillidap) are sister to Haploscleromorphap rather than part of Democlaviap. Within Keratosap, we found equivocal results as to the monophyly of Dictyoceratida. Within Myxospongiaep, Chondrosida and Verongida were monophyletic. A well-supported clade within Democlaviap, Tetractinellidap, composed of all sampled members of Astrophorina and Spirophorina (including the only lithistid in our analysis), was consistently revealed as the sister group to all other members of Democlaviap. Within Tetractinellidap, we did not recover monophyletic Astrophorina or Spirophorina. Our results also reaffirmed the monophyly of order Poecilosclerida (excluding Desmacellidae and Raspailiidae), and polyphyly of Hadromerida and Halichondrida. Conclusions/Significance: These results, using an independent nuclear gene set, confirmed many hypotheses based on ribosomal and/or mitochondrial genes, and they also identified clades with low statistical support or clades that conflicted with traditional morphological classification. Our results will serve as a basis for future exploration of these outstanding questions using more taxon- and gene-rich datasets.","<b>Model of fundamental ecological niche for species of the genus Thraulodes (Ephemeroptera: Leptophlebiidae: Atalophlebiinae)<\/b><br><br>Research on mayflies biogeography in the American continent have been generally narrative, proposing centers of origin and dispersal routes, suggesting distribution patterns for certain genera. Few researches have addressed the species level. In order to determine potential distribution patterns for species of Thraulodes, we used MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy), software based on the fundamental ecological niche model. From georeferenced records of 51 species we generated distribution patterns for 15 species that had 5 or more records. Area under Curve (AUC) data were close to 1 for T. brunneus, T. cochunaensis, T. consorts, T. eccentricus, T. gonzalesi, T. itatiajanus, T. lunatus, T. pacaya, T. packeri, T. paysandensis, T. Speciosus, T. schlingeri, T. tenulineus and T. zonalis, except for T. grandis. Across the continent, the variable determining the distributions was the ecoregion, and to a lesser extent those related to temperature and precipitation. Species with distributions ranges that go from the Mesoamerican domain (Caribbean subregion of the Neotropics) to the Nearctic appear to tend to overlapping and are less restricted than those species of South American Neotropics.","<b>Comparing hidden Markov model and hidden semi-Markov model based detectors of apnea-bradycardia episodes in preterm infants<\/b><br><br>In this paper, we propose, evaluate and compare two detectors of apnea-bradycardia episodes, based on hidden Markov models (HMM) and hidden semi-Markov models (HSMM). Evaluation is performed on a database of 233 apnea-bradycardia episodes manually annotated. The acquired ECG signals are processed to obtain RR series. The proposed detectors, applied to these RR series, are composed of two HMM or HSMM models, each one representing two distinct physiopathological states: absence and presence of apnea-bradycardia. A learning phase is firstly applied to each model in order to estimate their parameters from a learning dataset. Then, using a sliding window, the models are applied to a set of new observations, to compute the log-likelihood of each model for each time instant. Detection of the events of interest is based on the comparison of log-likelihoods with respect to a threshold. The optimal detection configuration was obtained in terms of sensitivity, specificity and detection delay. Results show that the analysis of the dynamics of RR series, through the HSMM, allows for a significant improvement of sensitivity (90.38% vs 88.42%) and specificity (92.23% vs 89.67%), with a reduction of the detection delay (0.92±3.56s vs 1.60±3.72s). © 2012 CCAL.","<b>Multiresponse metamodeling in simulation-based design applications<\/b><br><br>The optimal design of complex systems in engineering requires the availability of mathematical models of system's behavior as a function of a set of design variables; such models allow the designer to search for the best solution to the design problem. However, system models (e.g., computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, physical prototypes) are usually time-consuming and expensive to evaluate, and thus unsuited for systematic use during design. Approximate models of system behavior based on limited data, also known as metamodels, allow significant savings by reducing the resources devoted to modeling during the design process. In this work in engineering design based on multiple performance criteria, we propose the use of multi-response Bayesian surrogate models (MR-BSM) to model several aspects of system behavior jointly, instead of modeling each individually. To this end, we formulated a family of multiresponse correlation functions, suitable for prediction of several response variables that are observed simultaneously from the same computer simulation. Using a set of test functions with varying degrees of correlation, we compared the performance of MR-BSM against metamodels built individually for each response. Our results indicate that MR-BSM outperforms individual metamodels in 53 to 75 of the test cases, though the relative performance depends on the sample size, sampling scheme and the actual correlation among the observed response values. In addition, the relative performance of MR-BSM versus individual metamodels was contingent upon the ability to select an appropriate covariance/correlation function for each application, a task for which a modified version of Akaike's Information Criterion was observed to be inadequate. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.","<b>On the recovery of galaxy properties from spectral fits<\/b><br><br>We show the results of a non-parametric, fully bayesian implementation of a spectral fitting algorithm, designed to calculate the main physical parameters that govern the galaxy assembly process.

However, in 2007, HIV-1 infection was detected for the first time in the Warao Amerindian population living in the Eastern part of Venezuela, in the delta of the Orinoco river. The aim of this study was to analyze the genetic diversity of the HIV-1 circulating in this population. Methodology/Principal Findings: The pol genomic region was sequenced for 16 HIV-1 isolates and for some of them, sequences from env, vif and nef genomic regions were obtained. All HIV-1 isolates were classified as subtype B, with exception of one that was classified as subtype C. The 15 subtype B isolates exhibited a high degree of genetic similarity and formed a highly supported monophyletic cluster in each genomic region analyzed. Evolutionary analyses of the pol genomic region indicated that the date of the most recent common ancestor of the Waraos subtype B clade dates back to the late 1990s. Conclusions/Significance: At least two independent introductions of HIV-1 have occurred in the Warao Amerindians from Venezuela. The HIV-1 subtype B was successfully established and got disseminated in the community, while no evidence of local dissemination of the HIV-1 subtype C was detected in this study. These results warrant further surveys to evaluate the burden of this disease, which can be particularly devastating in this Amerindian population, with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, hepatitis B, among other infectious diseases, and with limited access to primary health care. © 2012 Rangel et al.","<b>Non-monophyly and deep genetic differentiation across low-elevation barriers in a Neotropical montane bird (Basileuterus tristriatus; Aves: Parulidae)<\/b><br><br>Most widespread birds of Neotropical cloud forests exhibit phenotypic variation that is partitioned geographically suggesting allopatric divergence, but little is known about the extent to which such phenotypic differentiation is consistent with genetic variation. We studied geographic patterns of genetic differentiation in the Three-striped Warbler (Basileuterus tristriatus), a polytypic and widespread understory bird of the foothills and mid-elevation zone of the tropical Andes and adjacent mountains of Central and South America. We sequenced mitochondrial DNA for 196 samples covering the entire range of B. tristriatus, as well as 22 samples of its putative closest relatives: the Three-banded (B. trifasciatus) and Santa Marta (B. basilicus) warblers. We found deep genetic structure across the range of B. tristriatus, which consisted of ten major clades including B. trifasciatus, a species that was nested within B. tristriatus. In contrast, B. basilicus was not closely related to B. tristriatus but part of a clade of Myiothlypis warblers. Geographic boundaries among clades were clearly related to lowland gaps separating subspecies groups. The subspecies melanotis of the mountains of Central America was sister to a large clade including B. t. tacarcunae, and the rest of South American clades, including B. trifasciatus. Five clades are found in the northern Andes, where no signs of gene flow were found across barriers such as the Táchira Depression or the Magdalena valley. Our study highlights the importance of valleys in promoting and maintaining divergence in a lower montane forest bird. The substantial genetic and phenotypic differentiation, and the paraphyly uncovered in B. tristriatus, may call for revising its species boundaries. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Systematics of the grey mullets (Teleostei: Mugiliformes: Mugilidae): Molecular phylogenetic evidence challenges two centuries of morphology-based taxonomy<\/b><br><br>The family Mugilidae comprises mainly coastal marine species that are widely distributed in all tropical, subtropical and temperate seas. Mugilid species are generally considered to be ecologically important and they are a major food resource for human populations in certain parts of the world. The taxonomy and systematics of the Mugilidae are still much debated and based primarily on morphological characters. In this study, we provide the first comprehensive molecular systematic account of the Mugilidae using phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide sequence variation at three mitochondrial loci (16S rRNA, cytochrome oxidase I, and cytochrome b) for 257 individuals from 55 currently recognized species. The study covers all 20 mugilid genera currently recognized as being valid. The family comprises seven major lineages that radiated early on from the ancestor to all current forms. All genera that were represented by two species or more, except Cestraeus, turned out to be paraphyletic or polyphyletic. Thus, the present phylogenetic results generally disagree with the current taxonomy at the genus level and imply that the anatomical characters used for the systematics of the Mugilidae may be poorly informative phylogenetically. The present results should provide a sound basis for a taxonomic revision of the mugilid genera. A proportion of the species with large distribution ranges (including Moolgarda seheli, Mugil cephalus and M. curema) appear to consist of cryptic species, thus warranting further taxonomic and genetic work at the infra-generic level. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Species-level phylogeny of 'Satan's perches' based on discordant gene trees (Teleostei: Cichlidae: Satanoperca Günther 1862)<\/b><br><br>Neotropical rivers are home to the largest assemblage of freshwater fishes, but little is known about the phylogeny of these fishes at the species level using multi-locus molecular markers. Here, we present a phylogeny for all known species of the genus Satanoperca, a widespread group of Neotropical cichlid fishes, based on analysis of six unlinked genetic loci. To test nominal and proposed species limits for this group, we surveyed mtDNA sequence variation among 320 individuals representing all know species. Most nominal species were supported by this approach but we determined that populations in the Xingu, Tapajós, and Araguaia. +. Paraná Rivers are likely undescribed species, while S. jurupari and S. mapiritensis did not show clear genetic distinction. To infer a phylogeny of these putative species, we conducted maximum likelihood and Bayesian non-clock and relaxed clock analyses of concatenated data from three genes (one mitochondrial, two nuclear). We also used a multi-species coalescent model to estimate a species tree from six unlinked loci (one mitochondrial, five nuclear). The topologies obtained were congruent with other results, but showed only minimal to moderate support for some nodes, suggesting that more loci will be needed to satisfactorily estimate the distribution of coalescent histories within Satanoperca. We determined that this variation results from topological discordance among separate gene trees, likely due to differential sorting of ancestral polymorphisms. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Divergence and biogeography of the recently evolved Macaronesian red Festuca (Gramineae) species inferred from coalescence-based analyses<\/b><br><br>Studying the biogeography and the phylogeography of the endemic Macaronesian red Festuca species (Loliinae, Poaceae) is of prime interest in understanding the speciation and colonization patterns of recently evolved groups in oceanic archipelagos. Coalescence-based analyses of plastid trnLF sequences were employed to estimate evolutionary parameters and to test different species-history scenarios that model the pattern of species divergence. Bayesian IM estimates of species divergence times suggested that ancestral lineages of diploid Macaronesian and Iberian red fescues could have diverged between 1.2 and 1.57 Ma. When empirical data were compared to coalescence-based simulated distributions of discordance and p-distance statistics, two species-history models were chosen in which the first branching lineage derived in Canarian Festuca agustinii. Its sister lineage could have involved a recent polytomy leading to the Madeiran Festuca jubata, the Azorean Festuca francoi + Festuca petraea and the continental Festuca rivularis lineages (Canarian model) or the sequential branching of lineages leading to F. jubata and finally to the sister clades of F. rivularis and F. francoi + F. petraea (Sequential model). Nested clade phylogeographic analysis (NCPA) and a first adapted host-parasite co-evolutionary ParaFit method were used to detect the phylogeographic signal. NCPA inferred long-distance colonizations for the entire diploid red Festuca complex, but allopatric-fragmentation and isolation-by-distance (IBD) patterns were inferred within archipelagos. In addition, the ParaFit method suggested a generalized pattern of a stepping-stone model at all hierarchical levels. Maximum-likelihood-based dispersal- extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) models were superimposed on the Sequential model species tree. The three-independent-colonization (3IC) model was the best supported biogeographic scenario, concurring with previous analysis based on multilocus AFLP data. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","<b>Towards a general theory of optimal testing<\/b><br><br>In Pericchi and Pereira [1] it is argued against the traditional way on which testing is based on fixed significance level, either using p-values (with fixed levels of evidence, like the 5% rule) or α values. We instead, follow an approach put forward by [2], on which an optimal test is chosen by minimizing type I and type II errors. Morris DeGroot in his authoritative book [2], Probability and Statistics 2nd Edition, stated that it is more reasonable to minimize a weighted sum of Type I andType II error than to specify a value of type I error and then minimize Type II error. He showed it beyond reasonable doubt, but only in the very restrictive scenario of simple VS simple hypothesis, and it is not clear how to generalize it. We propose here a very natural generalization for composite hypothesis, by using general weight functions in the parameter space. This was also the position taken by [3, 4, 5]. We show, in a parallel manner to DeGroot's proof and Pereira's discussion, that the optimal test statistics are Bayes Factors, when the weighting functions are priors with mass on the whole parameter space. On theother hand when the weight functions are point masses in specific parameter values of practical significance, then a procedureis designed for which the sum of Type I error and Type IIerror in the specified points of practical significance is minimized. This can be seen as bridge between Bayesian Statistics and a new version of Hypothesis testing, more in line with statistical consistency and scientific insight. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.","<b>Population structure of the dengue viruses, Aragua, Venezuela, 2006-2007. Insights into dengue evolution under hyperendemic transmission<\/b><br><br>During the past three decades there has been a notable increase in dengue disease severity in Venezuela. Nevertheless, the population structure of the viruses being transmitted in this country is not well understood. Here, we present a molecular epidemiological study on dengue viruses (DENV) circulating in Aragua State, Venezuela during 2006-2007. Twenty-one DENV full-length genomes representing all of the four serotypes were amplified and sequenced directly from the serum samples. Notably, only DENV-2 was associated with severe disease. Phylogenetic trees constructed using Bayesian methods indicated that only one genotype was circulating for each serotype. However, extensive viral genetic diversity was found in DENV isolated from the same area during the same period, indicating significant in situ evolution since the introduction of these genotypes. Collectively, the results suggest that the non-structural (NS) proteins may play an important role in DENV evolution, particularly NS1, NS2A and NS4B proteins. The phylogenetic data provide evidence to suggest that multiple introductions of DENV have occurred from the Latin American region into Venezuela and vice versa. The implications of the significant viral genetic diversity generated during hyperendemic transmission, particularly in NS protein are discussed and considered in the context of future development and use of human monoclonal antibodies as antivirals and tetravalent vaccines. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Bayesian Inference for a Structural Credit Risk Model with Stochastic Volatility and Stochastic Interest Rates<\/b><br><br>We develop a novel structural credit risk model that extends the original Merton model by allowing for stochastic interest rates and stochastic volatility. The model is estimated using Bayesian methods implemented via a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, in light of the demonstrable advantages of likelihood approaches and the importance of taking into account parameter uncertainty documented in the literature. We solve the nontrivial computational problem of contingent claim valuation in our set-up by using a Taylor series approximation to the expectation of the claim payoffs under the risk-neutral measure. Finally, we illustrate our model and compare it against the Merton model with real data on a nonfinancial firm (Ford Motor Company) and three financial firms (Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Lehman Brothers) during the recent financial crisis. © The Author, 2014.

Our deterministic inversion considers an elastic isotropic medium model to jointly estimate Vp, Vs, density and source wavelet deviations. We estimate the probability of the gas sands with multivariate Gaussian classification based on seismic-derived elastic properties and petrophysical characterization. Our study shows that Ciénaga de Oro gas reservoir is characterized by lower density, moderately lower Vp and moderately larger Vs than surrounding strata and non-producing Ciénaga de Oro intervals. To further exploit the seismic and petrophysical information, we applied a stochastic petrophysical seismic inversion. The method combines the geostatistical modeling of reservoir parameters (porosity, shale fraction and saturation), a rock physics model for the prediction of the elastic properties and seismic modeling. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method we generate a large number of realizations of the reservoir and elastic parameters that jointly honor the seismic observations, the rock physics model and the prior information. With this approach we describe the posterior uncertainties of the reservoir properties including the gas saturation. © 2012 SEG.","<b>Scorpions from the primeval subgenus Archaeotityus produce putative homologs of Tityus serrulatus toxins active on voltage-gated sodium channels<\/b><br><br>It has been proposed that the subgenus Archaeotityus comprises the most ancient species group within the medically important scorpion genus Tityus. cDNA encoding sodium-channel active toxins from the type species of this subgenus, Tityus clathratus (central Venezuela), have been isolated and sequenced. Two cDNAs were retrieved that encoded 61 amino acid-long putative neurotoxins named Tcl1 and Tcl2. Sequence identity was highest (87%) when both were compared with β-toxin Ts1 from the Brazilian scorpion Tityus serrulatus and its homologs from T. bahiensis, T. stigmurus, and T. costatus. A Bayesian analysis indicated statistical support for the grouping of T. clathratus Tcl1 and Tcl2 with Brazilian gamma-like β-toxins, reinforcing previous phylogenetic studies which suggested an evolutionary relationship between the subgenus Archaeotityus and scorpion species inhabiting southeast South America belonging to the subgenus Tityus. © CEVAP 2012.","<b>Spatio-temporal hierarchical models for mapping relative risks of dengue in the Municipality of Girardot, Aragua State, Venezuela<\/b><br><br>Hierarchical Bayesian space-time models have been used in the mapping of disease, studies of environmental pollution and industrial pollution, among many others. Under this methodology, the data is associated with point in a locality E and an instant in time t. The aim of this work is to model the relative risk of dengue in Girardot Municipality, Aragua State, Venezuela, during the epidemic period 2009. In that sense, we propose three models. First, a binomial model that measures the variability in the count of occurrence of the disease in the parishes of the municipality. A second model includes the binomial model as a first hierarchical level, plus a second level which introduces the spatial effect, the temporal effect and space-time interaction. Finally, a third spatial model that follows a Poisson model at the first level of hierarchy for the number of cases, and in the second level of hierarchy relates the relative risk associated with covariates through the logarithm function over a random effect. Data were collected for weeks and classified according to the parishes of the municipality. The Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) was used to select the best model. The Poisson model was best suited to represent the relative risk of contracting dengue in the area under study, showing that high-risk patterns were found in the parishes located in the south and southwest of the Girardot municipality, some of them bordering the lake of Valencia.","<b>On-line apnea-bradycardia detection using hidden semi-Markov models<\/b><br><br>In this work, we propose a detection method that exploits not only the instantaneous values, but also the intrinsic dynamics of the RR series, for the detection of apnea-bradycardia episodes in preterm infants. A hidden semi-Markov model is proposed to represent and characterize the temporal evolution of observed RR series and different pre-processing methods of these series are investigated. This approach is quantitatively evaluated through synthetic and real signals, the latter being acquired in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Compared to two conventional detectors used in NICU our best detector shows an improvement of around 13% in sensitivity and 7% in specificity. Furthermore, a reduced detection delay of approximately 3 seconds is obtained with respect to conventional detectors. © 2011 IEEE.","<b>A phylogenetic analysis using full-length viral genomes of South American dengue serotype 3 in consecutive Venezuelan outbreaks reveals a novel NS5 mutation<\/b><br><br>Dengue virus currently causes 50-100. million infections annually. Comprehensive knowledge about the evolution of Dengue in response to selection pressure is currently unavailable, but would greatly enhance vaccine design efforts. In the current study, we sequenced 187 new dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) genotype III whole genomes isolated from Asia and the Americas. We analyzed them together with previously-sequenced isolates to gain a more detailed understanding of the evolutionary adaptations existing in this prevalent American serotype. In order to analyze the phylogenetic dynamics of DENV-3 during outbreak periods; we incorporated datasets of 48 and 11 sequences spanning two major outbreaks in Venezuela during 2001 and 2007-2008, respectively. Our phylogenetic analysis of newly sequenced viruses shows that subsets of genomes cluster primarily by geographic location, and secondarily by time of virus isolation. DENV-3 genotype III sequences from Asia are significantly divergent from those from the Americas due to their geographical separation and subsequent speciation. We measured amino acid variation for the E protein by calculating the Shannon entropy at each position between Asian and American genomes. We found a cluster of seven amino acid substitutions having high variability within E protein domain III, which has previously been implicated in serotype-specific neutralization escape mutants. No novel mutations were found in the E protein of sequences isolated during either Venezuelan outbreak. Shannon entropy analysis of the NS5 polymerase mature protein revealed that a G374E mutation, in a region that contributes to interferon resistance in other flaviviruses by interfering with JAK-STAT signaling was present in both the Asian and American sequences from the 2007-2008 Venezuelan outbreak, but was absent in the sequences from the 2001 Venezuelan outbreak. In addition to E, several NS5 amino acid changes were unique to the 2007-2008 epidemic in Venezuela and may give additional insight into the adaptive response of DENV-3 at the population level. © 2011.","<b>Microsatellites reveal widespread predominance of an invasive over an indigenous Bemisia tabaci in Venezuela<\/b><br><br>The whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is an important pest due to its capacity for producing strong infestations and transmitting plant viruses. The New World putative species of B. tabaci complex (NW) is the indigenous whitefly of the Americas, but only the invasive Middle East-Asia Minor 1 putative species of B. tabaci complex (MEAM1), commonly referred to as the \"B biotype\" was identified in a limited scope sampling in Venezuela. Similarly to MEAM1 invasions elsewhere, in this South American country there has been an increase in the geographic range and abundance of B. tabaci, and in the number of viruses that it transmits since the late 1980s. We estimated the diversity of B. tabaci to elucidate their role in the epidemiology of geminiviruses in Venezuela. Thirteen microsatellite loci were screened in samples collected from 19 localities in ten major agricultural states. A Bayesian clustering method (Structure) grouped the samples into two genetic groups. Control samples from whiteflies NW and MEAM1 and partial sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene showed that our samples of B. tabaci populations from Venezuela fall within NW and MEAM1 groups. In this survey, MEAM1 was predominant over NW whitefly in a proportion of 35:1. No evidence was observed for gene flow between indigenous and invader whitefly. Altogether, our results stress the urgency for controlling the proliferation of the invasive whitefly. © 2011 Springer Science & Business Media BV.","<b>Lineage diversification and morphological evolution in a large-scale continental radiation: The neotropical ovenbirds and woodcreepers (aves: furnariidae)<\/b><br><br>Patterns of diversification in species-rich clades provide insight into the processes that generate biological diversity. We tested different models of lineage and phenotypic diversification in an exceptional continental radiation, the ovenbird family Furnariidae, using the most complete species-level phylogenetic hypothesis produced to date for a major avian clade (97% of 293 species). We found that the Furnariidae exhibit nearly constant rates of lineage accumulation but show evidence of constrained morphological evolution. This pattern of sustained high rates of speciation despite limitations on phenotypic evolution contrasts with the results of most previous studies of evolutionary radiations, which have found a pattern of decelerating diversity-dependent lineage accumulation coupled with decelerating or constrained phenotypic evolution. Our results suggest that lineage accumulation in tropical continental radiations may not be as limited by ecological opportunities as in temperate or island radiations. More studies examining patterns of both lineage and phenotypic diversification are needed to understand the often complex tempo and mode of evolutionary radiations on continents. © 2011 The Author(s).

PRSV isolates are divided into biotypes P and W: both the P and W types naturally infect plants in the family Cucurbitaceae, whereas the P type naturally infects papaya (Carica papaya). Understanding the origin and nature of the PRSV genetic diversity and evolution is critical for the implementation of control strategies based on cross-protection and the deployment of transgenic plants that show resistance to virus isolates highly similar to the transgene. The molecular epidemiology of PRSV was evaluated by analyzing the nucleotide sequence of the capsid protein (CP) and helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) genes of isolates from around the world, including newly characterized ones from Colombia and Venezuela, using a relaxed molecular clock-based approach and a phylogeographic study. Our results confirm previous estimates on the origin of PRSV around 400 years ago and suggest distinct dispersion events from the Indian Peninsula to the rest of Asia, via Thailand, and subsequently to the Americas. A historical reconstruction of the P- and W-type characters in the phylogenetic study supports the need to revise the hypothesis that PRSV-P derives from PRSV-W since our results suggest that the ancestral state could be either of the two biotypes. Moreover, estimates of epidemic growth predict an increasing genetic diversity of the virus over time that has direct implications for control strategies of PRSV based on cross-protection and the use of transgenic plants. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Spatially varying autoregressive processes<\/b><br><br>We develop a class of models for processes indexed in time and space that are based on autoregressive (AR) processes at each location. We use a Bayesian hierarchical structure to impose spatial coherence for the coeficients of the AR processes. The priors on such coefficients consist of spatial processes that guarantee time stationarity at each point in the spatial domain. The AR structures are coupled with a dynamic model for the mean of the process, which is expressed as a linear combination of time-varying parameters. We use satellite data on sea surface temperature for the North Pacific to illustrate how the model can be used to separate trends, cycles, and short-term variability for high-frequency environmental data.

Modeling extreme rainfall behavior is important due to the impact of natural hazards on highly vulnerable zones. In this regard, and within the framework of the classical extreme theory, the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) model is proposed for the study of the behavior of extreme rainfall events in Venezuela. A Bayesian approach was used to estimate model parameters and to make predictive inference of the GEV model. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were used to get samples from the posterior distributions of the GEV model parameters. Numerical results are presented for six locations in Venezuela representing different mesoclimate types: La Mariposa (Miranda State); San Francisco de Macanao (Nueva Esparta State); Villa El Rosario (Zulia State); Machiques (Zulia State); Carora (Lara State); and San Carlos de Río Negro (Amazonas State). Simulations from the predictive distribution suggest that the Fr échet and Gumbel models are more appropriate to represent the annual maxima in most of the study locations; however, in locations with extreme conditions within arid or highly humid mesoclimates, the Weibull model is more appropriate to represent annual rainfall maxima.","<b>Improving multi-response metamodels with upper/lower bound information using multi-stage, non-stationary covariance functions<\/b><br><br>Metamodels have been proposed in the literature to reduce the time and resources devoted to design space exploration, to learn about design trade-offs, and to find the best solution to the design problem in the context of simulation-based design and optimization. In previous work in engineering design based on multiple performance criteria, we have proposed the use of Multi-response Bayesian Surrogate Models (MR-BSM) to model several response variables simultaneously, instead of modeling them independently. By doing so, it is expected that the correlation among the response variables can be used to achieve better models with smaller data sets. In this work, we extend the capabilities of MR-BSM by developing a multistage formulation with non-stationary covariance functions. This formulation for multi-response metamodeling in successive stages of experimental design, data acquisition and model fitting, enables the integration of different sources of information about system responses, with different levels of accuracy, into a single, global model of the system. The feasibility of the proposed formulation is demonstrated with an example in which two test functions are jointly approximated in two stages. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of the methodology to take advantage of a priori information, expressed as upper and lower bounds on the responses, to improve the accuracy of the metamodels. Results show that the use of bound information can result in order-of-magnitude improvements in metamodel accuracy. © 2010 by ASME.","<b>Probabilistic estimation of climate change in Venezuela using a Bayesian approach<\/b><br><br>The changing climate is one of the main environmental problems facing humanity, since slight variations in the climate variables might have terrible consequences in the economic activities and human well-being. Nowadays atmospheric Global Circulation Models (GCMs) are the main tools to study changing climate. The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MENR) led in 2005 the First Communication in Climate Change of Venezuela, using the outputs of 16 GCMs at a global scale (resolution of 5° × 5°) whose projections estimate increasing temperature and diminishing precipitation in the coming years. Each GCM gives different results, generating uncertainty in the future changing climate signal. This work uses a Bayesian approach and an extension of the Reliability Ensemble Average (REA) (Tebaldi et al. 2005) method, combining the outputs (present and future) of precipitation and temperature of the 16 GCMs with observations of present climate conditions, to determine the probability distributions of future changing climate change for these two climate variables in 9 regions in Venezuela. For this study, two criteria are used: bias, which considers the difference between the model outputs and the present climate; and convergence, which quantifies the differences among the simulated changes of future climate by multiple models. The main result of this work is that a large amount of uncertainty still exists in the GCMs projections, since they as yet do not include all aspects of the climate system functioning. It was also concluded that the lower the natural variability in the climate variable, the more effective is its projection.","<b>Analysis of Heifer's First Service Fertility in Dual Purpose Cattle Under an Animal Model<\/b><br><br>In order of evaluating first service fertility (FPS) on dual purpose heifers, this research was carry out with the electronic records from two commercial herds. A total of 6,823 records from crossbred animals. The response variable was first service fertility of the heifers. The analyses were realized under two approaches: classic and Bayesian. For the classic analysis, it was used a simple animal model that included the discrete fixed effects of herd, breed group and year-season of service, as well as the covariates age at the first service and weaning weight, both in quadratic form. In addition, it included the random additive direct genetic effect of the animal and the residual. In the first case, the analyses were realized with the program MTDFREML. Whereas in the second case, the data were analyzed with the same model animal in a threshold form, for which was used the program MTGSAM. Under this approach the size of the sampling chain, the burn in period and the thinning rate were approximated with GIBBSIT program, whereas the analysis of posterior distribution of the sampling chain were realized with program GIBANAL. The overall length of the chain was 136,000 samples, discarding the first 1,000 and settling down a thinning rate retaining each 14th element of the sequence. The global percentage of FPS was of 65%. Under the classic approach the heritability was 0.03 ± 0.02, which once transformed to the underlying normal scale raised to 0.05. Meanwhile under the Bayesian approach the analysis of the 9,642 samples reflected that the average of the posterior distribution of the heritability was 0.0735; the median of the same distribution was 0.0650, with estimators in the rank between 0.0130 and 0.2270. Selection for this variable could only produce very slow changes in the population.","<b>Evolution of Dengue virus type 3 genotype III in Venezuela: Diversification, rates and population dynamics<\/b><br><br>Background. Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. DENV are comprised of four distinct serotypes (DENV-1 through DENV-4) and each serotype can be divided in different genotypes. Currently, there is a dramatic emergence of DENV-3 genotype III in Latin America. Nevertheless, we still have an incomplete understanding of the evolutionary forces underlying the evolution of this genotype in this region of the world. In order to gain insight into the degree of genetic variability, rates and patterns of evolution of this genotype in Venezuela and the South American region, phylogenetic analysis, based on a large number (n = 119) of envelope gene sequences from DENV-3 genotype III strains isolated in Venezuela from 2001 to 2008, were performed. Results. Phylogenetic analysis revealed an in situ evolution of DENV-3 genotype III following its introduction in the Latin American region, where three different genetic clusters (A to C) can be observed among the DENV-3 genotype III strains circulating in this region. Bayesian coalescent inference analyses revealed an evolutionary rate of 8.48 × 10-4 substitutions/site/year (s/s/y) for strains of cluster A, composed entirely of strains isolated in Venezuela. Amino acid substitution at position 329 of domain III of the E protein (AV) was found in almost all E proteins from Cluster A strains. Conclusions. A significant evolutionary change between DENV-3 genotype III strains that circulated in the initial years of the introduction in the continent and strains isolated in the Latin American region in recent years was observed. The presence of DENV-3 genotype III strains belonging to different clusters was observed in Venezuela, revealing several introduction events into this country. The evolutionary rate found for Cluster A strains circulating in Venezuela is similar to the others previously established for this genotype in other regions of the world. This suggests a lack of correlation among DENV genotype III substitution rate and ecological pattern of virus spread. © 2010 Ramírez et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","<b>A comprehensive multilocus phylogeny for the wood-warblers and a revised classification of the Parulidae (Aves)<\/b><br><br>The birds in the family Parulidae-commonly termed the New World warblers or wood-warblers-are a classic model radiation for studies of ecological and behavioral differentiation. Although the monophyly of a 'core' wood-warbler clade is well established, no phylogenetic hypothesis for this group has included a full sampling of wood-warbler species diversity. We used parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods to reconstruct relationships among all genera and nearly all wood-warbler species, based on a matrix of mitochondrial DNA (5840 nucleotides) and nuclear DNA (6 loci, 4602 nucleotides) characters. The resulting phylogenetic hypotheses provide a highly congruent picture of wood-warbler relationships, and indicate that the traditional generic classification of these birds recognizes many non-monophyletic groups. We recommend a revised taxonomy in which each of 14 genera (Seiurus, Helmitheros, Mniotilta, Limnothlypis, Protonotaria, Parkesia, Vermivora, Oreothlypis, Geothlypis, Setophaga, Myioborus, Cardellina, Basileuterus, Myiothlypis) corresponds to a well-supported clade; these nomenclatural changes also involve subsuming a number of well-known, traditional wood-warbler genera (Catharopeza, Dendroica, Ergaticus, Euthlypis, Leucopeza, Oporornis, Parula, Phaeothlypis, Wilsonia). We provide a summary phylogenetic hypothesis that will be broadly applicable to investigations of the historical biogeography, processes of diversification, and evolution of trait variation in this well studied avian group. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Spatio-temporal Bayesian hierarchical modeling of Dengue incidence in the metropolitan area of Maracay, Venezuela<\/b><br><br>Dengue fever is a major public health problem in Aragua State, Venezuela. The situation has worsened in recent years, with a major epidemic during 2001. During 2002 and 2003 the exposition rates and relative risks of the municipalities that encompass Aragua State showed the highest relative risk of infection in the metropolitan area of Maracay. The municipalities of Girardot (capital), Francisco Linares Alcántara and Santiago Mariño concentrated the highest risk. During 2002 and 2003 the number of new dengue cases increased especially during the rainy season, showing the existence of a seasonal pattern. The present work presents Bayesian Hierarchical Models with spatio-temporal structure that included climatic and socioeconomic explanatory variables used to identify factors of major influence on dengue incidence and determined the municipalities with higher risks. Models were fitted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and selected using the deviance information criteria (DIC), respectively. These models constitute an important tool that epidemiologists and public health officers in Aragua State have to consider for the control of the vector Aedes aegypti Linnaeus.","<b>Reinforcing and expanding the predictions of the disturbance vicariance hypothesis in Amazonian harlequin frogs: A molecular phylogenetic and climate envelope modelling approach<\/b><br><br>The disturbance vicariance hypothesis (DV) has been proposed to explain speciation in Amazonia, especially its edge regions, e. g. in eastern Guiana Shield harlequin frogs (Atelopus) which are suggested to have derived from a cool-adapted Andean ancestor. In concordance with DV predictions we studied that (i) these amphibians display a natural distribution gap in central Amazonia; (ii) east of this gap they constitute a monophyletic lineage which is nested within a pre-Andean/western clade; (iii) climate envelopes of Atelopus west and east of the distribution gap show some macroclimatic divergence due to a regional climate envelope shift; (iv) geographic distributions of climate envelopes of western and eastern Atelopus range into central Amazonia but with limited spatial overlap. We tested if presence and apparent absence data points of Atelopus were homogenously distributed with Ripley's K function. A molecular phylogeny (mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene) was reconstructed using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference to study if Guianan Atelopus constitute a clade nested within a larger genus phylogeny. We focused on climate envelope divergence and geographic distribution by computing climatic envelope models with MaxEnt based on macroscale bioclimatic parameters and testing them by using Schoener's index and modified Hellinger distance. We corroborated existing DV predictions and, for the first time, formulated new DV predictions aiming on species' climate envelope change. Our results suggest that cool-adapted Andean Atelopus ancestors had dispersed into the Amazon basin and further onto the eastern Guiana Shield where, under warm conditions, they were forced to change climate envelopes. © 2010 The Author(s).","<b>A comparison of metamodel-assisted pre-screening criteria for multi-objective genetic algorithms<\/b><br><br>Over the last few years, research activity in approximation (e.g. metamodels) and optimization (e.g. genetic algorithms) methods has improved upon current practices in engineering design and optimization of complex systems with respect to multiple performance metrics, by reducing the number of evaluations of the system's model that are needed to obtain the set of non-dominated solutions to a given multi-objetive optimal design problem. To this end, several authors have proposed to enhance Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms (MOGAs) with metamodel-based pre-screening criteria (PSC), so that only those solutions that have the most potential to improve the current approximation of the Pareto Front are evaluated with the (costly) system model. The main goals of this work are to compare the performance of several PSC with an array of test functions taken from the literature, and to study the potential effect on their effectiveness and efficiency of using multi-response metamodels, instead of building independent, individual metamodels for each objective function, as has been done in previous work. Our preliminary results show that no single PSC is observed to be superior overall, though the Minimum of Minimum Distances and Expected Improvement criteria outperformed other PSC in most cases. Results also show that the use of multi-response metamodels improved both the effectiveness and efficiency of PSC and the quality of solution at the end of the optimization in 50% to 60% of test cases.

Previous studies based upon morphological characters have proposed the separation of this complex into two genera (Mithrax and Mithraculus), but cladistic analyses based upon larval characters do not support this division. A molecular phylogeny of the group may help to resolve this long-standing taxonomic question and shed light on the ecological conditions driving the diversity of these crabs. Using a 550-bp alignment of the 16S rRNA mitochondrial DNA segment we examined the phylogenetic relationships between 8 species within the Mithrax-Mithraculus complex native to the Caribbean. The resulting phylogeny indicates that this complex is paraphyletic, as it includes the genus Microphrys. The analyses revealed a well-supported, monophyletic group containing four species of Mithraculus (M. cinctimanus, M. coryphe, M. sculptus and M. forceps) and supported one pair of sister species from the genus Mithrax (M. caribbaeus and M. spinosissimus). No complete segregation of species, according to genera, was evident, however, from tree topologies. Bayesian-factor analyses revealed strong support for the unconstrained tree instead of alternative trees in which monophyly of the two genera was forced. Thus, the present molecular phylogeny does not support the separation of the species within this complex into the genera Mithrax and Mithraculus. A review of the literature demonstrated considerable phenotypic variation within monophyletic clades in this group. © Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom 2009.","<b>The Casiquiare river acts as a corridor between the Amazonas and Orinoco river basins: Biogeographic analysis of the genus Cichla<\/b><br><br>The Casiquiare River is a unique biogeographic corridor between the Orinoco and Amazonas basins. We investigated the importance of this connection for Neotropical fishes using peacock cichlids (Cichla spp.) as a model system. We tested whether the Casiquiare provides a conduit for gene flow between contemporary populations, and investigated the origin of biogeographic distributions that span the Casiquiare. Using sequences from the mitochondrial control region of three focal species (C. temensis, C. monoculus, and C. orinocensis) whose distributions include the Amazonas, Orinoco, and Casiquiare, we constructed maximum likelihood phylograms of haplotypes and analyzed the populations under an isolation-with-migration coalescent model. Our analyses suggest that populations of all three species have experienced some degree of gene flow via the Casiquiare. We also generated a mitochondrial genealogy of all Cichla species using >2000 bp and performed a dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA) to reconstruct the historical biogeography of the genus. This analysis, when combined with the intraspecific results, supports two instances of dispersal from the Amazonas to the Orinoco. Thus, our results support the idea that the Casiquiare connection is important across temporal scales, facilitating both gene flow and the dispersal and range expansion of species. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","<b>Seismic inversion for reservoir properties combining statistical rock physics and geostatistics: A review<\/b><br><br>There are various approaches for quantitative estimation of reservoir properties from seismic inversion. A general Bayesian formulation for the inverse problem can be implemented in two different work flows. In the sequential approach, first seismic data are inverted, deterministically or stochastically, into elastic properties; then rock-physics models transform those elastic properties to the reservoir property of interest. The joint or simultaneous work flow accounts for the elastic parameters and the reservoir properties, often in a Bayesian formulation, guaranteeing consistency between the elastic and reservoir properties. Rock physics plays the important role of linking elastic parameters such as impedances and velocities to reservoir properties of interest such as lithologies, porosity, and pore fluids. Geostatistical methods help add constraints of spatial correlation, conditioning to different kinds of data and incorporating subseismic scales of heterogeneities. © 2010 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.","<b>Genetic history of hepatitis C virus in Venezuela: High diversity and long time of evolution of HCV genotype 2<\/b><br><br>Background: The subtype diversity of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes is unknown in Venezuela. Methodology/Principal Findings: Partial sequencing of the NS5B region was performed in 310 isolates circulating in patients from 1995 to 2007. In the samples collected between 2005 and 2007, HCV genotype 1 (G1) was the most common genotype (63%), composed as expected of mainly G1a and G1b. G2 was the second most common genotype (33%), being G2a almost absent and G2j the most frequent subtype. Sequence analysis of the core region confirmed the subtype assignment performed within the NS5b region in 63 isolates. The complete genome sequence of G2j was obtained. G2j has been described in France, Canada and Burkina Fasso, but it was not found in Martinique, where several subtypes of G2 circulate in the general population. Bayesian coalescence analysis indicated a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of G2j around 1785, before the introduction of G1b (1869) and G1a (1922). While HCV G1a and G1b experienced a growth reduction since 1990, coincident with the time when blood testing was implemented in Venezuela, HCV G2j did not seem to reach growth equilibrium during this period. Conclusions/Significance: Assuming the introduction of G2j from Africa during the slave trade, the high frequency of G2j found in Venezuela could suggest: 1- the introduction of African ethnic groups different from the ones introduced to Martinique or 2- the occurrence of a founder effect. This study represents an in-depth analysis of the subtype diversity of HCV in Venezuela, which is still unexplored in the Americas and deserves further studies. © 2010 Sulbaran et al.","<b>Characterization of antigenetic serotypes from the dengue virus in Venezuela by means of grid computing<\/b><br><br>This work determines the molecular epidemiology of dengue virus in Venezuela by means of phylogenetic calculations performed on the EELA-2 Grid infrastructure with the PhyloGrid application, an open source tool that allows users performing phylogeny reconstruction in their research.

We developed Bayesian equations, which modify the virtual layer sampling method proposed by Liu, Harder, and Berne (LHB). Additionally, we obtained an analytical solution for the corresponding nonhomogeneous Langevin equation. The expressions found for the mean-squared displacement in the layers contain naturally a modification due to the mean force in the transverse component in terms of the anisotropic diffusion constants and mean exit time. Instead of running a time consuming dual MD-Langevin simulation dynamics, as proposed by LHB, our expression was used to fit the MD data in the entire survival time interval not only for the parallel but also for the perpendicular direction. The only fitting parameter was the diffusion constant in each layer. © 2009 The American Physical Society.","<b>Recovering decay rates from noisy measurements with maximum entropy in the mean<\/b><br><br>We present a new method, based on the method of maximum entropy in the mean, which builds upon the standard method of maximum entropy, to improve the parametric estimation of a decay rate when the measurements are corrupted by large level of noise and, more importantly, when the number of measurements is small. The method is developed in the context on a concrete example: that of estimation of the parameter in an exponential distribution. We show how to obtain an estimator with the noise filtered out, and using simulated data, we compare the performance of our method with the Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. © 2009 H.

We find that these limit distributions belong to the domain of attraction of the Fréchet family when the parent distribution of the daily values is a TPT t-Student model. In this case, the shape parameter of the limiting GEV model depends on the degrees of freedom and the power transformation parameter. When the parent distribution of the daily values is a TPT Normal model, the limiting GEV model is independent of the parameters of the parent model. We perform a detailed inference and predictive analysis to verify these theoretical results using a Bayesian approach. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) were used to estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters of the t-Student model for daily rainfall on one hand, and to estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters of the GEV model for the annual maxima on the other hand. Numerical results are presented for two locations: Maiquetía (Vargas State), and La Mariposa (Miranda State), Venezuela. Simulations from the predictive distribution of the daily values suggest a good approximation between the extreme distribution of the TPT t-Student model and the Fréchet model found by standard extreme value limit theory. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","<b>A study of covariance functions for multi-response metamodeling for simulation-based design and optimization<\/b><br><br>The optimal design of complex systems in engineering requires the availability of mathematical models of system's behavior as a function of a set of design variables; such models allow the designer to find the best solution to the design problem. However, system models (e.g. CFD analysis, physical prototypes) are usually time-consuming and expensive to evaluate, and thus unsuited for systematic use during design. Approximate models, or metamodels, of system behavior based on a limited set of data allow significant savings by reducing the resources devoted to modeling during the design process. In our work in engineering design based on multiple performance criteria, we propose the use of Multi-response Bayesian Surrogate Models (MRBSM) to model several aspects of system behavior jointly, instead of modeling each individually. By doing so, it is expected that the observed correlation among the response variables can be used to achieve better models with smaller data sets. In this work, we study the approximation capabilities of several covariance functions needed for multi-response metamodeling with MRBSM, performing a simulation study in which we compare MRBSM based on different covariance functions against metamodels built individually for each response. Our preliminary results indicate that MRBSM outperforms individual metamodels in 46% to 67% of the test cases, though the relative performance of the studied covariance functions is highly dependent on the sampling scheme used and the actual correlation among the observed response values.

In this paper we present an interdisciplinary work based on an ambulatory blood pressure study and the development of a new classification algorithm named REMED. We focused on the discovery of new patterns for abnormal blood pressure variability as a possible cardiovascular risk factor. We compared our results with other classification algorithms based on Bayesian methods, decision trees, and rule induction techniques. In the comparison, REMED showed similar accuracy to these algorithms but it has the advantage of being superior in its capacity to classify sick people correctly. Therefore, our method could represent an innovative approach that might be useful in medical decision support for cardiovascular disease prognosis. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","<b>Bayesian regularization: Application to calibration in NIR spectroscopy<\/b><br><br>The use of a Bayesian regularization algorithm is proposed for calibration in near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) with linear models.

The taxonomic status of one of the best studied Paracoccidioides isolates (Pb01) as P. brasiliensis remains unresolved due to its genomic differences from the other three previously described phylogenetic species (S1, PS2 and PS3; Carrero et al., 2008. Fungal Genet. Biol. 45, 605). Using the genealogic concordance method of phylogenetic species recognition (GCPSR) via maximum parsimony and Bayesian analysis, we identified a clade of 17 genotypically similar isolates, including Pb01, which are distinct from the S1/PS2/P3 clade. Consistent with GCPSR, this \"Pb01-like\" group can be considered a new phylogenetic species, since it is strongly supported by all independent and concatenated genealogies. \"Pb01-like\" species exhibit great sequence and morphological divergence from the S1/PS2/PS3 species clade, and we estimate that these groups last shared a common ancestor approximately 32 million years ago. In addition, recombination analysis revealed independent events inside both main groups suggesting reproductive isolation. Consequently, we recommend the formal description of the \"Pb01-like\" cluster as the new species Paracoccidioides lutzii, a tribute to Adolpho Lutz, discoverer of P. brasiliensis in 1908. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Genetic diversity and structure among Iranian tall fescue populations based on genomic-SSR and EST-SSR marker analysis<\/b><br><br>Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. subsp. arundinacea) is one of the most economically important forage grasses in cold and temperate regions of the world. In this study, we have assessed the genetic diversity and structure of wild Iranian tall fescue populations. Thirty-seven individuals from nine natural populations from northern, western, and southern Iranian mountain ranges were analyzed using six genomic-SSRs and five EST-SSRs primer pairs. Our analysis has demonstrated that transcribed EST-SSR regions showed levels of polymorphism similar to genomic-SSR regions. UPGMA, repeated bisection, and model-based Bayesian STRUCTURE clustering methods coupled with neighbornet network were used to establish six divergent groups of individuals. FST estimates among clusters showed moderate to low genetic structure. Within-group genetic diversity estimate H and partial correlations between genetic and geographic distances among populations suggested that western Zagros population was related to the rest of the Iranian individuals.

We analysed 1.2 kb from 13 of the 15 described species of Mannophryne. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses support the monophyly of Mannophryne. Mannophryne consists of three deeply differentiated clades that split from each other in a relatively short period of time. The diversification of Mannophryne occurred well before the glacial-interglacial periods of the Quaternary. Our data support the taxonomic validity of M. olmonae, a species endemic to Tobago Island. Mannophryne olmonae is more closely related to the continental species Mannophryne riveroi than to the Trinidad island endemic Mannophryne trinitatis. As in most tropical clades of frogs, molecular evidence indicates that species richness in Mannophryne is largely underestimated and, consequently, current priorities for conservation are inadequate. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London.","<b>Assessment and propagation of input uncertainty in tree-based option pricing models<\/b><br><br>This paper aims to provide a practical example of assessment and propagation of input uncertainty for option pricing when using tree-based methods. Input uncertainty is propagated into output uncertainty, reflecting that option prices are as unknown as the inputs they are based on. Option pricing formulas are tools whose validity is conditional not only on how close the model represents reality, but also on the quality of the inputs they use, and those inputs are usually not observable. We show three different approaches to integrating out the model nuisance parameters and show how this translates into model uncertainty in the tree model space for the theoretical option prices. We compare our method with classical calibration-based results assuming that there is no options market established and no statistical model linking inputs and outputs. These methods can be applied to pricing of instruments for which there is no options market, as well as a methodological tool to account for parameter and model uncertainty in theoretical option pricing.

The gating of BK channels and its modulation by Ca2+ and voltage has been the subject of intensive research over almost three decades, yielding several of the most complicated kinetic mechanisms ever proposed. A large number of open and closed states disposed, respectively, in two planes, named tiers, characterize these mechanisms. Transitions between states in the same plane are cooperative and modulated by Ca2+. Transitions across planes are highly concerted and voltage-dependent. Here we reexamine the validity of the two-tiered hypothesis by restricting attention to the modulation by Ca 2+. Large single channel data sets at five Ca2+ concentrations were simultaneously analyzed from a Bayesian perspective by using hidden Markov models and Markov-chain Monte Carlo stochastic integration techniques. Our results support a dramatic reduction in model complexity, favoring a simple mechanism derived from the Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric model for homotetramers, able to explain the Ca2+ modulation of the gating process. This model differs from the standard Monod-Wyman-Changeux scheme in that one distinguishes when two Ca2+ ions are bound to adjacent or diagonal subunits of the tetramer. © 2009 by the Biophysical Society.","<b>Petrophysical seismic inversion conditioned to well-log data: Methods and application to a gas reservoir<\/b><br><br>Hydrocarbon reservoirs are characterized by seismic, well-log, and petrophysical information, which is dissimilar in spatial distribution, scale, and relationship to reservoir properties. We combine this diverse information in a unified inverse-problem formulation using a multiproperty, multiscale model, linking properties statistically by petrophysical relationships and conditioning them to well-log data. Two approaches help us: (1) Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling, which generates many reservoir realizations for estimating medium properties and posterior marginal probabilities, and (2) optimization with a least-squares iterative technique to obtain the most probable model configuration. Our petrophysical model, applied to near-vertical-anglestackedseismic data and well-log data from a gas reservoir, includes a deterministic component, based on a combination of Wyllie and Wood relationships calibrated with the well-log data, and a random component, based on the statistical characterization of the deviations of well-log data from the petrophysical transform. At the petrophysical level, the effects of porosity and saturation on acoustic impedance are coupled; conditioning the inversion to well-log data helps resolve this ambiguity. The combination of well logs, petrophysics, and seismic inversion builds on the corresponding strengths of each type of information, jointly improving (1) cross resolution of reservoir properties, (2) vertical resolution of property fields, (3) compliance to the smooth trend of property fields, and (4) agreement with well-log data at well positions. © 2009 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

However, most statistical models available in the literature assume some kind of parametric form (clearly neglecting important characteristics of the data) or focus on modeling extreme events (therefore, providing no information about the rest of the distribution). In this paper we develop a Bayesian nonparametric prior for a collection of distributions evolving in discrete time. The prior is constructed by defining the distribution at any time point as a Dirichlet process mixture of Gaussian distributions, and inducing dependence through the atoms of their stick-breaking decomposition. A general construction, which allows for trends, periodicities and regressors is described. The resulting model is applied to the estimation of the time-varying travel expense distribution of employees from a major development bank comparable to the IDB, IMF and World Bank. © 2008 International Society for Bayesian Analysis.","<b>Bayesian parameter inference for models of the Black and Scholes type<\/b><br><br>In this paper, we describe a general method for constructing the posterior distribution of the mean and volatility of the return of an asset satisfying dS = S dX for some simple models of X.

As an application of our framework, we compute the value at risk (VaR) and conditional VaR (CVaR) measures for the changes in the price of an option implied by the posterior distribution of the volatility of the underlying. The implied VaR and CVaR are more conservative than their classical counterpart, since it takes into account the estimation risk that arises due to parameter uncertainty.

These beetles are morphologically highly distinct and at a body length of 0.8 mm represent the perhaps smallest individuals of Adephaga. Here, we use DNA sequence data to place this enigmatic taxon relative to other aquatic groups in this suborder. Meruidae was most closely associated with Noteridae, supporting a previous analysis of morphological structures which had suggested this sister relationship, albeit with weak support. While different alignment strategies did not affect the topology, the precise placement of Meruidae was affected by the choice of tree reconstruction method. Bayesian inference suggests a sister relationship of Meruidae + Noteridae, while parsimony analyses retrieve Meruidae + Notomicrus (a basal noterid genus), which combined are the sister group of all remaining Noteridae.

The data come from the climatic network from the Venezuelan Guayana Coorporation- Caroni Electrification (CVG-EDELCA), the Venezuelan Air Force (FAV), and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN). An homogeneity test is carried out by using Alexandersson's test (Alexandersson 1986) to detect locations with important changes in the mean, which are not part of the natural climate variability. Linear models with a trend component, a seasonal component and autoregressive errors are fitted by using Generalized Least Squares. Different models are compared to determine whether the trend component should be included within the model, as well as the seasonal component with one or two harmonics, depending on whether the precipitation presents a single or two modes along the year. The Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) is used for model selection. The estimated trend values and the significance of the trend component are spatially represented. It is found that in the northern coastal region and most of the Andean region precipitation trends are negative. On the contrary, southeast of Bolívar state presents a positive trend. However, the model trend component is not significant for most locations. Moreover, the seasonal pattern is best represented with a model with two harmonics, given the seasonal characteristics of the analyzed locations.","<b>Bayesian spatio-temporal models based on discrete convolutions<\/b><br><br>The authors consider a class of models for spatio-temporal processes based on convolving independent processes with a discrete kernel that is represented by a lower triangular matrix.

Particular care will be devoted to obtain fractional moments from the available information given in terms of integer moments and/or moment generating function. Numerical examples show clearly that the bound improvement involving the ME approximant based on fractional moments is not trivial.","<b>Molecular phylogeny and historical biogeography of the cosmopolitan parasitic wasp subfamily Doryctinae (Hymenoptera:Braconidae)<\/b><br><br>The phylogenetic relationships among representatives of 64 genera of the cosmopolitan parasitic wasps of the subfamily Doryctinae were investigated based on nuclear 28S ribosomal (r) DNA (∼650 bp of the D2-3 region) and cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) mitochondrial (mt) DNA (603 bp) sequence data. The molecular dating of selected clades and the biogeography of the subfamily were also inferred. The partitioned Bayesian analyses did not recover a monophyletic Doryctinae, though the relationships involved were only weakly supported. Strong evidence was found for rejecting the monophylies of both Doryctes Haliday, 1836 and Spathius Nees, 1818. Our results also support the recognition of the Rhaconotini as a valid tribe. A dispersal-vicariance analysis showed a strong geographical signal for the taxa included, with molecular dating estimates for the origin of Doryctinae and its subsequent radiation both occurring during the late Paleocene-early Eocene. The divergence time estimates suggest that diversification in the subfamily could have in part occurred as a result of continental break-up events that took place in the southern hemisphere, though more recent dispersal events account for the current distribution of several widespread taxa. © CSIRO 2008.","<b>On the application of Hidden Markov Model and Bayesian Belief Network to seismic noise at Las Cañadas Caldera, Tenerife, Spain<\/b><br><br>The Teide-Pico Viejo volcanic complex situated in Tenerife Island (Canary Islands, Spain) has recently shown signs of unrest, long after its last eruptive episode at Chinyero in 1909, and the last explosive episode which happened at Montaña Blanca, 2000 years ago. In this paper we study the seismicity of the Teide-Pico Viejo complex recorded between May and December 2004, in order to show the applicability of tools such as Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian Belief Networks which can be used to build a structure for evaluating the probability of given eruptive or volcano-related scenarios.

The genus Sotalia (coastal and riverine South American dolphins) is currently considered a member of the Stenoninae subfamily, along with the genera Steno (rough toothed dolphin) and Sousa (humpbacked dolphin). In recent years, a revision of this classification was proposed based on phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b, wherein Sousa was included in the Delphininae subfamily, keeping only Steno and Sotalia as members of the Stenoninae subfamily. Here we investigate the phylogenetic placement of Sotalia using two mitochondrial genes, six autosomal introns and four Y chromosome introns, providing a total of 5,196 base pairs (bp) for each taxon in the combined dataset. Sequences from these genomic regions were obtained for 17 delphinid species, including at least one species from each of five or six currently recognized subfamilies plus five odontocete outgroup species. Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of independent (each fragment) and combined datasets (mtDNA, nuDNA or mtDNA+nuDNA) showed that Sotalia and Sousa fall within a clade containing other members of Delphininae, exclusive of Steno. Sousa was resolved as the sister taxon to Sotalia according to analysis of the nuDNA dataset but not analysis of the mtDNA or combined mtDNA+nuDNA datasets. Based on the results from our multi-locus analysis, we offer several novel changes to the classification of Delphinidae, some of which are supported by previous morphological and molecular studies. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

For the simulation of the seismic data we convolve a source wavelet with the reflectivity series obtained with ray tracing and the exact solution of the Zoeppritz equations; we also include in the inversion scheme prior information of the statistics of the elastic medium parameters. We invert the seismic data using a sampling Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique that generates a long chain of the stratified model realizations, all probable in terms of the geophysical and prior statistical information, and convergent to the posterior probability density. In this technique we combine the Gibbs and the Metropolis algorithms. We validate the method with numerical tests, using elastic models simulated on the basis of the statistics of real well-logged data, including mean property values, standard deviations and correlation across the elastic properties. With this method we produce a complete description of the uncertainties of the model parameters.","<b>A single origin of gall association in a group of parasitic wasps with disparate morphologies<\/b><br><br>The braconid wasp subfamily Doryctinae mainly comprises idiobiont ectoparasitoids of other insect larvae. In recent years, however, members of a few genera have been discovered to be associated with galls from various unrelated host plant families, with some of these being gall inducers whereas others are suspected as being predators of gallers. Because of their considerable morphological differences, these gall-associated taxa traditionally have been placed in separate tribes or even in other subfamilies. In this study, we investigate the phylogenetic relationships among representatives of a number of different doryctine genera, including five of its seven gall-associated genera using two genetic markers. Here we analyzed the length-variable 28S sequence data based on secondary structure both excising the unalignable regions and recoding them according to indel length. In addition, multiple alignments were carried out with a range of gap-opening and extension parameters. The combined (28S + CO1) phylogenetic hypotheses obtained, both excluding and recoding the unalignable regions, recover a clade comprising the five gall-associated genera, and most of the analyses using multiple alignments also support this relationship. These results support a scenario in which secondary phytophagy evolves from initially attacking primary gall-forming hosts. The relationships recovered are also more congruent with a model that explains the macroevolution of insect plant association in the Doryctinae as reflecting geographic proximity rather than host plant relationships. Further, our phylogenetic hypotheses consistently show that one of the main morphological features employed in the higher level classification of the Doryctinae is actually highly homoplastic. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

First, a linear regression scheme is applied to obtain the optimal number of HFU present in core data. Next, the results obtained are used as input for the nonlinear optimization scheme based on the probability plot from which statistical parameters of each population are obtained. Subsequently, Bayes' rule is applied for clustering core data into its respective HFU. Finally, an algorithm based on Bayesian inference is applied to predict permeability in uncored wells. The methodology is applied to a Venezuelan sandstone reservoir and to a Middle East sandstone reservoir. Application of the methodology allows permeability prediction in cored wells with correlation coefficients above 0.95 for the field cases under analysis. Permeability profiles in uncored wells compare well with pressure transient test results. Among primary applications are better productivity index assessments, enhanced petrophysical evaluations, and improved reservoir simulation models.

Key to the success of metamodeling efforts are the experimental design techniques used to generate the combinations of input variables at which the computer experiments are conducted. Several adaptive sampling techniques have been proposed to tailor the experimental designs to the specific application at hand, using the already-acquired data to guide further exploration of the input space, instead of using a fixed sampling scheme defined a priori. Though mixed results have been reported, it has been argued that adaptive sampling techniques can be more efficient, yielding better surrogate models with less sampling points. In this paper, we address the problem of adaptive sampling for single and multi-response metamodels, with a focus on Multi-stage Multi-response Bayesian Surrogate Models (MMBSM). We compare distance-optimal latin hypercube sampling, an entropy-based criterion and the maximum cross-validation variance criterion, originally proposed for one-dimensional output spaces and implemented in this paper for multi-dimensional output spaces. Our results indicate that, both for single and multi-response surrogate models, the entropy-based adaptive sampling approach leads to models that are more robust to the initial experimental design and at least as accurate (or better) when compared with other sampling techniques using the same number of sampling points.

The design and development of the IDS are considered in our 3 main stages: normal behavior construction, anomaly detection and model update. A parametrical mixture model is used for behavior modeling from reference data. The associated Bayesian classification leads to the detection algorithm. MIB variables are used to provide IDS needed information. Experiments of DoS and scanner attacks validating the model are presented as well. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2006.","<b>Cryptic speciation and recombination in the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis as revealed by gene genealogies<\/b><br><br>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is the etiologic agent of paracoccidioidomycosis, a disease confined to Latin America and of marked importance in the endemic areas due to its frequency and severity. This species is considered to be clonal according to mycological criteria and has been shown to vary in virulence. To characterize natural genetic variation and reproductive mode in this fungus, we analyzed P. brasiliensis phylogenetically in search of cryptic species and possible recombination using concordance and nondiscordance of gene genealogies with respect to phylogenies of eight regions in five nuclear loci. Our data indicate that this fungus consists of at least three distinct, previously unrecognized species: S1 (species 1 with 38 isolates), PS2 (phylogenetic species 2 with six isolates), and PS3 (phylogenetic species 3 with 21 isolates). Genealogies of four of the regions studied strongly supported the PS2 clade, composed of five Brazilian and one Venezuelan isolate. The second clade, PS3, composed solely of 21 Colombian isolates, was strongly supported by the α-tubulin genealogy. The remaining 38 individuals formed S1. Two of the three lineages of P. brasiliensis, S1 and PS2, are sympatric across their range, suggesting barriers to gene flow other than geographic isolation. Our study provides the first evidence for possible sexual reproduction in P. brasiliensis S1, but does not rule it out in the other two species. © The Author 2005.

According to MPC approach, at each sampling time, the controller is calculated by minimizing an upper bound of a quadratic cost function over infinite time horizon. The optimization problem and the associated constraints on the input and output process are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI). From the input-output representation, an extended state space model is constructed, where the state is composed of present and past values of the system's inputs and outputs. The control is obtained as a function of known output and input signals, hence there is no need for any estimate of the unmeasured states, as it would be necessary in the \"traditional\" state space modelization. The proposed algorithm is illustrated on numerical examples. © 2005 IEEE.","<b>Molecular phylogenetics and biogeography of the Neotropical redstarts (Myioborus; Aves, Parulinae)<\/b><br><br>Montane areas in the Neotropics are characterized by high diversity and endemism of birds and other groups. The avian genus Myioborus (Parulinae) is a group of insectivorous warblers, characteristic of cloud forests, that represents one of the few Parulinae genera (New World warblers) that has radiated substantially in South America. The genus is distributed throughout most montane regions from the southwestern United States to northern Argentina. Here, I use mitochondrial sequences from the cytochrome b, ND2, and ND3 genes to present the first hypothesis of phylogenetic relationship among all Myioborus species level taxa. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods produced similar results and suggest a northern origin for the genus Myioborus with subsequent colonization of the Neotropical Montane Region. The lower-montane species, M. miniatus, is the sister taxon to a clade in which all taxa occupy upper-montane habitats. These \"highland\" taxa diverged early in the history of the genus and produced two well-defined monophyletic lineages, a Central-northern Andean clade formed by M. albifrons, M. ornatus, and M. melanocephalus, and a Pantepui (table-mountains of southern Venezuela, northern Brazil, and western Guyana) clade consisting of M. castaneocapillus, M. albifacies, and M. cardonai, and probably M. pariae. M. brunniceps, M. flavivertex, and M. torquatus were included in this upper-montane clade but without clear relationships to other taxa. Lack of resolution of nodes defining the upper-montane species clade is likely to result from a period of rapid diversification mediated by geological and climatic events during the Late Pliocene. These results suggest that an interplay of dispersal and vicariance has shaped the current biogeographic patterns of Myioborus.","<b>Interpolation performance of a spatio-temporal model with spatially varying coefficients: Application to PM10 concentrations in Rio de Janeiro<\/b><br><br>In this work we present a Bayesian analysis in linear regression models with spatially varying coefficients for modeling and inference in spatio-temporal processes. This kind of model is particularly appealing in situations where the effect of one or more explanatory processes on the response present substantial spatial heterogeneity. We describe for this model how to make inference about the regression coefficients and response processes under two scenarios: when the explanatory processes are known throughout the study region, and when they are known only at the sampling locations. Using a simulation experiment we investigate how parameter inference and interpolation performance are affected by some features of the data and prior distribution that is used. The proposed methodology is used to model the dataset on PM10 levels in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro presented in Paez and Gamerman (2003). © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.","<b>Very small array observations of the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect in nearby galaxy clusters<\/b><br><br>We present Very Small Array (VSA) observations (centred on ≈34 GHz) on scales ≈20 arcmin towards a complete, X-ray flux-limited sample of seven clusters at redshift z < 0.1. Four of the clusters have significant Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) detections in the presence of cosmic microwave background (CMB) primordial anisotropy. For all seven, we use a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for inference from the VSA data, with X-ray priors on cluster positions and temperatures, and radio priors on sources. In this context, the CMB primordial fluctuations are an additional source of Gaussian noise, and are included in the model as a non-diagonal covariance matrix derived from the known angular power spectrum. In addition, we make assumptions of β-model gas distributions and of hydrostatic equilibrium, to evaluate probability densities for the gas mass (Mgas) and total mass (Mr) out to r200, the radius at which the average density enclosed is 200 times the critical density at the redshift of the cluster. This is further than has been done before and close to the classical value for a collapsed cluster. Our combined estimate of the gas fraction (f gas = Mgas/Mr) is 0.08-0.04 +0.06h-1. The random errors are poor (note, however, that the errors are higher than would have been obtained with the usual χ 2 method on the same data) but the control of bias is good. We have described the MCMC analysis method specifically in terms of SZ but hope the description will be of more general use. We find that the effects of primordial CMB contamination tend to be similar in the estimates of both Mgas and Mr over the narrow range of angular scales we are dealing with, so that there is little effect of primordials fgas determination. Using our Mr estimates we find a normalization of the mass-temperature relation based on the profiles from the VSA cluster pressure maps, which is in good agreement with recent M-T determinations from X-ray cluster measurements. © 2005 RAS.","<b>CYP11B2-CYP11B1 haplotypes associated with decreased 11β-hydroxylase activity<\/b><br><br>Reduced adrenal 11β-hydroxylation has been associated with an aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) polymorphism. The 11β-hydroxylase gene (CYP11B1) lies close to CYP11B2. We hypothesize that a molecular variant in CYP11B2 is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a key quantitative trait in CYP11B1 determining this phenotype. Polymorphisms and inferred haplotypes at CYP11B loci were studied in two independent populations from Europe (n = 100) and South America (n = 99). The latter underwent detailed hormonal studies. LD was estimated by alternative Bayesian methods for inferring the extent of LD when haplotypes at different loci are inferred. Population differences in single nucleotide polymorphisms were modest, indicating the stability of both genes across populations. Using five of nine potentially informative loci at CYP11B sites with allele frequency greater than 0.1, two major contrasting haplotypes, CwtCG and TconvGTA, were found. In both populations the CwtCG haplotype accounted for 44% and the TconvGTA for 32% of subjects. Haplotype distribution did not differ between Europeans and South Americans (χ2 = 2.81; P = 0.09). In vivo 11β-hydroxylase activity, estimated from urinary steroid profiling, was lower in subjects with an increased aldosterone to renin ratio or with the TconvGTA haplotype. These findings indicate that genotypes at the CYP11B locus are in strong LD and that identified haplotypes predict 11β-hydroxylase activity.","<b>Joint estimation of spatial deformation and blurring in environmental data<\/b><br><br>Joint estimation of deformation and blurring parameters from spatial observations is considered.

This proposal consists on a data fusion system with two inputs: The \"A\" input corresponds to the gradient image after having made the pre-processing links to the acquisition, filtering and interpolation. The \"B\" input corresponds a parametric equation of a priori model whose equation can be an ellipsoid or a superquadrics. These two inputs are fusion together by using the Bayesian methodology of probabilities with the purpose to obtain a new function \"F\". That will be used to stop the Level Set Method to segment the inside of the internal wall of the Left Ventricle (LV). Finally the 3D visualization of the LV volume is obtained using the method of marching cubes, and the 3D global model is adjusted to the previous reconstruction. The analysis of the Mean Square Error (MSE) between the calculated model and the real LV volume is smaller than 5%, which confirms the precision of computing of the global medical parameters. In conclusion, the segmentation method based on data fusion allows to obtain simultaneously the global model and the local model of deformation. © 2004 IEEE.","<b>Optimal bayesian design by inhomogeneous Markov chain simulation<\/b><br><br>We consider decision problems defined by a utility function and an underlying probability model for all unknowns. The utility function quantifies the decision maker's preferences over consequences. The optimal decision maximizes the expected utility function where the expectation is taken with respect to all unknowns, that is, future data and parameters. In many problems, the solution is not analytically tractable. For example, the utility function might involve moments that can be computed only by numerical integration or simulation. Also, the nature of the decision space (i.e., the set of all possible actions) might have a shape or dimension that complicates the maximization. The motivating application for this discussion is the choice of a monitoring network when the optimization is performed over the high-dimensional set of all possible locations of monitoring stations, possibly including choice of the number of locations. We propose an approach to optimal Bayesian design based on inhomogeneous Markov chain simulation. We define a chain such that the limiting distribution identifies the optimal solution. The approach is closely related to simulated annealing. Standard simulated annealing algorithms assume that the target function can be evaluated for any given choice of the variable with respect to which we wish to optimize. For optimal design problems the target function (i.e., expected utility) is in general not available for efficient evaluation and might require numerical integration. We overcome the problem by defining an inhomogeneous Markov chain on an appropriately augmented space. The proposed inhomogeneous Markov chain Monte Carlo method addresses within one simulation both problems, evaluation of the expected utility and maximization.","<b>MCMC for hidden Markov models incorporating aggregation of states and filtering<\/b><br><br>This paper is concerned with the statistical analysis of single ion channel records. Single channels are modelled by using hidden Markov models and a combination of Bayesian statistics and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The techniques presented here provide a straightforward generalization to those in Rosales et al. (2001, Biophys. J., 80, 1088-1103), allowing to consider constraints imposed by a gating mechanism such as the aggregation of states into classes. This paper also presents an extension that allows to consider correlated background noise and filtered data, extending the scope of the analysis toward real experimental conditions. The methods described here are based on a solid probabilistic basis and are less computationally intensive than alternative Bayesian treatments or frequentist approaches that consider correlated data. © 2003 Society for Mathematical Biology.

The model is based on a time-varying regression of the observed readings on air temperature. Such a regression requires interpolated values of temperature at locations and times where readings are not available. These are obtained from a time-varying spatiotemporal model that is coupled to the model for the ozone readings. Two location-dependent harmonic components are added to account for the main periodicities that ozone presents during a given day and that are not explained through the covariate. The model incorporates spatial covariance structure for the observations and the parameters that define the harmonic components. Using the dynamic linear model framework, we show how to compute smoothed means and predictive values for ozone. We illustrate the methodology on data from September 1997.","<b>Calcium Regulation of Single Ryanodine Receptor Channel Gating Analyzed Using HMM/MCMC Statistical Methods<\/b><br><br>Type-II ryanodine receptor channels (RYRs) playa fundamental role in intracellular Ca2+ dynamics in heart. The processes of activation, inactivation, and regulation of these channels have been the subject of intensive research and the focus of recent debates. Typically, approaches to understand these processes involve statistical analysis of single RYRs, involving signal restoration, model estimation, and selection. These tasks are usually performed by following rather phenomenological criteria that turn models into self-fulfilling prophecies. Here, a thorough statistical treatment is applied by modeling single RYRs using aggregated hidden Markov models. Inferences are made using Bayesian statistics and stochastic search methods known as Markov chain Monte Carlo. These methods allow extension of the temporal resolution of the analysis far beyond the limits of previous approaches and provide a direct measure of the uncertainties associated with every estimation step, together with a direct assessment of why and where a particular model fails. Analyses of single RYRs at several Ca2+ concentrations are made by considering 16 models, some of them previously reported in the literature. Results clearly show that single RYRs have Ca 2+-dependent gating modes. Moreover, our results demonstrate that single RYRs responding to a sudden change in Ca2+ display adaptation kinetics. Interestingly, best ranked models predict microscopic reversibility when monovalent cations are used as the main permeating species. Finally, the extended bandwidth revealed the existence of novel fast buzz-mode at low Ca 2+ concentrations.","<b>Phylogenetic relationships of Vulpia and related genera (Poeae, Poaceae) based on analysis of its and trnL-F sequences<\/b><br><br>A phylogenetic study of Vulpia, fine-leaved Festuca (Festuca subg. Festuca p.p.), and other related genera of the tribe Poeae (Poaceae) has been conducted using both separate and combined analyses of DNA sequences from the nuclear ITS region and the chloroplast trnL-F region. All five sections of Vulpia (sects. Vulpia, Monachne, Spirachne, Loretia, Apalochloa) and three sections and one subsection of fine-leaved Festuca (sects. Eskia, Festuca, Aulaxyper, subsect. Exaratae) were included in the analysis. Six minor annual genera that have been considered in the past to be related either to Vulpia or to these fescues (Psilurus, Ctenopsis, Cutandia, Narduroides, Micropyrum, Wangenheimia) were also analyzed in order to estimate an evolutionary framework for this poorly known group of ephemeral or thin-leaved grasses. Single representatives of other less related groups of Poeae (Festuca subg. Schedonorus and Drymanthele, Lolium, Dactylis, Poa, Puccinellia, Sesleria), Triticeae (Secale), and Brachypodieae (Brachypodium) were also studied. Phylogenetic analyses were performed based on parsimony and Bayesian inference criteria using Brachypodium distachyon as outgroup. Our results indicate that Vulpia and the fine-leaved Festuca are, respectively, polyphyletic and paraphyletic assemblages of several taxa. A well-supported monophyletic group that encompasses the fine-leaved Festuca and Vulpia lineages as well as the other six ephemeral genera (FEVRE) has been obtained from both the separate and the combined ITS and trnL-F analyses. Within this FEVRE clade Festuca sect. Eskia is shown to be a paraphyletic assemblage basal to the other taxa; the core of the FEVRE clade contains four supported clades representing, respectively, the lineages Aulaxyper + Vulpia pro parte (diploid), Festuca + Wangenheimia, Psilurus + Vulpia pro parte (polyploid), and Spirachne + Monachne + Loretia. Vulpia unilateralis (Apalochloa) constitutes a monospecific lineage with apparent but unsupported affinities to some of its potential closer relatives. Representatives of all the Vulpia sections except those belonging to typical section Vulpia join in a paraphyletic poorly supported assemblage that also includes Cutandia, Festuca plicata, and Ctenopsis. Two of the studied annual genera, Micropyrum and Narduroides, show distant evolutionary placements in the ITS and trnL-F trees. The Festuca subsect. Exaratae taxa belong to a phylogenetic lineage diverging from those of the Festuca ovina (sect. Festuca) and F. rubra (sect. Aulaxyper) fescues. Nucleotide substitution rates show significant differences between most perennial and annual lineages; stabilized selection is maintained in the slowly diverging perennial groups, whereas the rapid adaptive evolutionary processes shown by the annual taxa may have resulted in an increased rate in cladogenesis. The Mediterranean region is hypothesized as the likely place of divergence of these grass lineages.","<b>Phylogeny of the festucoid grasses of subtribe Loliinae and allies (Poeae, Pooideae) inferred from ITS and trnL-F sequences<\/b><br><br>Analyses of ribosomal ITS and chloroplast trnL-F sequences provide phylogenetic reconstruction for the festucoids (Poeae: Loliinae), a group of temperate grasses with morphological and molecular affinities to the large genus Festuca. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses of the combined ITS/trnL-F dataset show Loliinae to be monophyletic but unresolved for a weakly supported clade of 'broad-leaved Festuca,' a well-supported clade of 'fine-leaved Festuca,' and Castellia. The first group includes subgenera Schenodorus, Drymanthele, Leucopoa, and Subulatae, and sections Subbulbosae, Scariosa, and Pseudoscariosa of Festuca, plus Lolium and Micropyropsis. The second group includes sections Festuca, Aulaxyper, Eskia, and Amphigenes of Festuca, plus Vulpia, Ctenopsis, Psilurus, Wangenheimia, Cutandia, Narduroides, and Micropyrum. Subtribes Dactylidinae and Cynosurinae/Parapholiinae are sister clades and are the closest relatives of Loliinae. Vulpia is polyphyletic within the 'fine-leaved' fescues as revealed by the two genome analyses. Lolium is resolved as monophyletic in the ITS and combined analyses, but unresolved in the trnL-F based tree. Conflict between the ITS and the trnL-F trees in the placement of several taxa suggests the possibility of past reticulation events, although lineage sorting and possible ITS paralogy cannot be ruled out. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In many applications it will be preferable to work with multivariate spatial processes to specify such models. A critical specification in providing these models is the cross covariance function. Constructive approaches for developing valid cross-covariance functions offer the most practical strategy for doing this. These approaches include separability, kernel convolution or moving average methods, and convolution of covariance functions. We review these approaches but take as our main focus the computationally manageable class referred to as the linear model of coregionalization (LMC). We introduce a fully Bayesian development of the LMC. We offer clarification of the connection between joint and conditional approaches to fitting such models including prior specifications. However, to substantially enhance the usefulness of such modelling we propose the notion of a spatially varying LMC (SVLMC) providing a very rich class of multivariate nonstationary processes with simple interpretation. We illustrate the use of our proposed SVLMC with application to more than 600 commercial property transactions in three quite different real estate markets, Chicago, Dallas and San Diego. Bivariate nonstationary process models are developed for income from and selling price of the property.","<b>Was it possible to anticipate probabilistically the Vargas tragedy?<\/b><br><br>The short answer is yes. Provided Extreme Value Theory is employed under a Bayesian approach to statistics. The conventional analysis based on the assumptions of a homogeneous population of annual maxima with a Gumbel distribution, with parameters estimated from the data and then \"plugged-in\" in the distribution to make predictions, yield that the rainfall observed on December 15, 1999, would be observed on average in 17 million years! Even worse, had we conducted a classical hypothesis test, prior to December 15, 1999, then the Gumbel test would not have been rejected. We instead model the data following a non-homogeneous seasonal Generalized Pareto Distribution under a Bayesian framework that explicitly takes into account the uncertainties about the parameter and models. For computation we use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computational methods. Central references to this article are: Coles and Pericchi (3) and Coles, Pericchi and Sisson (4).","<b>Lithologic characterization of a reservoir using continuous-wavelet transforms<\/b><br><br>We consider the problem of characterizing the lithology of a reservoir using gamma ray logs as well as seismic ces around the well. We first calculate the continuous-wavelet transform of the the data and then use the fact that the energy of such transformation is proportional to a power of its scale. The technique consists in estimating the power transformation obtaining a set of values of the same size as the original data and then modeling the distribution of these values using a double exponential. We find that wells that are predominantly sand correspond to distributions that are significantly different from those that correspond to wells that are predominantly gravel. This happens in both cases: gamma rays and seismic traces. We use this characterization to classify other points in the reservoir.","<b>A two steps disaggregation method for highly seasonal monthly rainfall<\/b><br><br>The need for high resolution rainfall data at temporal scales varying from daily to hourly or even minutes is a very important problem in hydrology. For many locations of the world, rainfall data quality is very poor and reliable measurements are only available at a coarse time resolution such as monthly. The purpose of this work is to apply a stochastic disaggregation method of monthly to daily precipitation in two steps: 1. Initialization of the daily rainfall series by using the truncated normal model as a reference distribution. 2. Restructuring of the series according to various time series statistics (autocorrelation function, scaling properties, seasonality) by using a Markov chain Monte Carlo based algorithm. The method was applied to a data set from a rainfall network of the central plains of Venezuela, in where rainfall is highly seasonal and data availability at a daily time scale or even higher temporal resolution is very limited. A detailed analysis was carried out to study the seasonal and spatial variability of many properties of the daily rainfall as scaling properties and autocorrelation function in order to incorporate the selected statistics and their annual cycle into an objective function to be minimized in the simulation procedure. Comparisons between the observed and simulated data suggest the adequacy of the technique in providing rainfall sequences with consistent statistical properties at a daily time scale given the monthly totals. The methodology, although highly computationally intensive, needs a moderate number of statistical properties of the daily rainfall. Regionalization of these statistical properties is an important next step for the application of this technique to regions in where daily data is not available. © Springer-Verlag 2002.","<b>Applying non-parametric robust Bayesian analysis to non-opinionated judicial neutrality<\/b><br><br>This paper explores the usefulness of robust Bayesian analysis in the context of an applied problem, finding priors to model judicial neutrality in an age discrimination case. We seek large classes of prior distributions without trivial bounds on the posterior probability of a key set, that is, without bounds that are independent of the data. Such an exploration shows qualitatively where the prior elicitation matters most, and quantitatively how sensitive the conclusions are to specified prior changes. The novel non-parametric classes proposed and studied here represent judicial neutrality and are reasonably wide, so that when a clear conclusion emerges from the data at hand, this is arguably very reliable. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","<b>Time-varying autoregressions with model order uncertainty<\/b><br><br>We explore some aspects of the analysis of latent component structure in non-stationary time series based on time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) models that incorporate uncertainty on model order. Our modelling approach assumes that the AR coefficients evolve in time according to a random walk and that the model order may also change in time following a discrete random walk. In addition, we use a conjugate prior structure on the autoregressive coefficients and a discrete uniform prior on model order. Simulation from the posterior distribution of the model parameters can be obtained via standard forward filtering backward simulation algorithms. Aspects of implementation and inference on decompositions, latent structure and model order are discussed for a synthetic series and for an electroencephalogram (EEG) trace previously analysed using fixed order TVAR models.","<b>Objective bayesian analysis of spatially correlated data<\/b><br><br>Spatially varying phenomena are often modeled using Gaussian random fields, specified by their mean function and covariance function. The spatial correlation structure of these models is commonly specified to be of a certain form (e.g., spherical, power exponential, rational quadratic, or Matérn) with a small number of unknown parameters. We consider objective Bayesian analysis of such spatial models, when the mean function of the Gaussian random field is specified as in a linear model. It is thus necessary to determine an objective (or default) prior distribution for the unknown mean and covariance parameters of the random field. We first show that common choices of default prior distributions, such as the constant prior and the independent Jeffreys prior, typically result in improper posterior distributions for this model. Next, the reference prior for the model is developed and is shown to yield a proper posterior distribution. A further attractive property of the reference prior is that it can be used directly for computation of Bayes factors or posterior probabilities of hypotheses to compare different correlation functions, even though the reference prior is improper. An illustration is given using a spatial dataset of topographic elevations. © 2001, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Techniques such as late potential (LP) measurements in the high-resolution electrocardiogram (HRECG), abnormal intra-QRS potentials (AIQP), and time-frequency measurements, have been used for evaluating signals of patients with chagasic myocarditis. The goal of these indexes is to identify different stages of the disease, however their predictive performance is not fully satisfactory. In this work, we extend the previous developments using a wavelet based Bayesian modelling approach for analyzing and classifying unfiltered HRECG signals. We evaluate the predictive capabilities of the proposed model through a Bayesian classification based on maximum posterior probability. The technique provides considerably higher specificity and accuracy rates and may improve the predictive values of HRECG in assessing chagasic myocarditis.","<b>Comparison of PCR and common clinical tests for the diagnosis of H. pylori in dyspeptic patients<\/b><br><br>Helicobacter pylori has been recognized as a major gastric pathogen. The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of common clinical tests to detect H. pylori infection, by comparison with PCR. Serum and gastric biopsy specimens from 106 dyspeptic patients were examined. Serology was performed with Pyloriset Dry test, and biopsies were examined histologically, for rapid urease activity and PCR amplification of an ureA gene segment of H. pylori. PCR primers were specific for H. pylori and required at least 1.47 pg of H. pylori DNA, corresponding to about 800 bacterial cells. According to serology, histology, rapid urease, and PCR, positive results were respectively found in 56%, 86%, 64%, and 85% of dyspeptic patients, primarily with gastritis. Relative to PCR, the sensitivity (and specificity) was 55% (38%) for serology, 86% (13%) for histology, 70% (69%) for urease. When combining histology and urease, Bayesian analysis of data indicated no advantage of using combined methods over rapid urease test alone. Histology should not any longer be considered a gold standard test for Helicobacter pylori. Urea breath test still seems the first option for non invasive diagnostic. If an invasive diagnostic is justified, highly specific and sensitive molecular methods should be used to examine specimens. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.","<b>Bayesian restoration of ion channel records using hidden Markov models<\/b><br><br>Hidden Markov models have been used to restore recorded signals of single ion channels buried in background noise. Parameter estimation and signal restoration are usually carried out through likelihood maximization by using variants of the Baum-Welch forward-backward procedures. This paper presents an alternative approach for dealing with this inferential task. The inferences are made by using a combination of the framework provided by Bayesian statistics and numerical methods based on Markov chain Monte Carlo stochastic simulation. The reliability of this approach is tested by using synthetic signals of known characteristics. The expectations of the model parameters estimated here are close to those calculated using the Baum-Welch algorithm, but the present methods also yield estimates of their errors. Comparisons of the results of the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach with those obtained by filtering and thresholding demonstrate clearly the superiority of the new methods.","<b>Dynamic models for spatiotemporal data<\/b><br><br>We propose a model for non-stationary spatiotemporal data. To account for spatial variability, we model the mean function at each time period as a locally weighted mixture of linear regressions. To incorporate temporal variation, we allow the regression coefficients to change through time. The model is cast in a Gaussian state space framework, which allows us to include temporal components such as trends, seasonal effects and autoregressions, and permits a fast implementation and full probabilistic inference for the parameters, interpolations and forecasts. To illustrate the model, we apply it to two large environmental data sets: tropical rainfall levels and Atlantic Ocean temperatures.","<b>Multichannel electroencephalographic analyses via dynamic regression models with time-varying lag-lead structure<\/b><br><br>Multiple time series of scalp electrical potential activity are generated routinely in electroencephalographic (EEG) studies. Such recordings provide important non-invasive data about brain function in human neuropsychiatric disorders. Analyses of EEG traces aim to isolate characteristics of their spatiotemporal dynamics that may be useful in diagnosis, or may improve the understanding of the underlying neurophysiology or may improve treatment through identifying predictors and indicators of clinical outcomes. We discuss the development and application of non-stationary time series models for multiple EEG series generated from individual subjects in a clinical neuropsychiatric setting. The subjects are depressed patients experiencing generalized tonic-clonic seizures elicited by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as antidepressant treatment. Two varieties of models - dynamic latent factor models and dynamic regression models - are introduced and studied. We discuss model motivation and form, and aspects of statistical analysis including parameter identifiability, posterior inference and implementation of these models via Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. In an application to the analysis of a typical set of 19 EEG series recorded during an ECT seizure at different locations over a patient's scalp, these models reveal time-varying features across the series that are strongly related to the placement of the electrodes. We illustrate various model outputs, the exploration of such time-varying spatial structure and its relevance in the ECT study, and in basic EEG research in general.","<b>A Nonstationary Multisite Model for Rainfall<\/b><br><br>Estimation and prediction of the amount of rainfall in time and space is a problem of fundamental importance in many applications in agriculture, hydrology, and ecology. Stochastic simulation of rainfall data is also an important step in the development of stochastic downscaling methods where large-scale climate information is considered as an additional explanatory variable of rainfall behavior at the local scale. Simulated rainfall has also been used as input data for many agricultural, hydrological, and ecological models, especially when rainfall measurements are not available for locations of interest or when historical records are not of sufficient length to evaluate important rainfall characteristics as extreme values. Rainfall estimation and prediction were carried out for an agricultural region of Venezuela in the central plains state of Guárico, where rainfall for 10-day periods is available for 80 different locations. The measurement network is relatively sparse for some areas, and aggregated rainfall at time resolutions of days or less is of very poor quality or nonexistent. We consider a model for rainfall based on a truncated normal distribution that has been proposed in the literature. We assume that the data yit, where i indexes location and t indexes time, correspond to normal random variates wit that have been truncated and transformed. According to this model, the dry periods correspond to the (unobserved) negative values and the wet periods correspond to a transformation of the positive ones. The serial structure present in series of rainfall data can be modeled by considering a stochastic process for wit. We use a dynamic linear model on wt = (w1t, …, wNt) that includes a Fourier representation to allow for the seasonality of the data that is assumed to be the same for all sites, plus a linear combination of functions of the location of each site. This approach captures year-to-year variability and provides a tool for short-term forecasting. The model is fitted using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method that uses latent variables to handle dry periods and missing values. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","<b>Wavelet based Bayesian models for characterizing chagasic high-resolution ECG signals<\/b><br><br>The study of high resolution ECG signals (HRECG) has proven useful in assessing the risk of arrhythmic events in patients suffering chagasic myocarditis. Various time and frequency domain criteria have been developed to evaluate abnormal potentials in chagasic patients, leading to the characterization of the disease in terms of ECG features. In this work we present a Bayesian wavelet based modeling approach to analyze HRECG signals from 61 subjects classified into 3 groups: a control group of patients with no evidence of cardiac damage and two groups of chagasic patients with two different levels cardiac damage. We use of probability model that decomposes the expected value of each wavelet coefficient for a given signal in two terms: a mean component common to all signals, and a term capturing group features. The model is able to find differences among the groups in terms of estimated posterior signals and posterior distributions of the wavelet coefficients.","<b>Bayesian hierarchical model with wavelet transform coefficients of the ECG in obstructive sleep apnea screening<\/b><br><br>Wavelet Transform allows analyzing the properties of a variety of signals, being able to emphasize changes in either time or frequency domain once the appropriate scale in chosen. Since a signal can be expressed in terms of coefficients from wavelet functions, the behavior of this signal could be sparsely represented in these functions, expressing possible properties behind nonstationary signals. Recently, methods based on hierarchical Bayes analysis have been found to be a feasible tool in the approach of physical science and engineering applications. In order to participate in the apnea screening event at the Computers in Cardiology Challenge 2000 and estimate a model that could bring us to an adequate classification between groups we developed the present methodology.","<b>Bayesian prediction of clipped Gaussian random fields<\/b><br><br>This work provides a framework to perform prediction in some types of binary random fields.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the legislated emission reductions using monitoring data, this paper proposes a two-stage approach for the estimation of regional trends and their standard errors. In the first stage, a generalized additive model (GAM) is fitted to airborne sulfur dioxide (SO2) data at each of 35 sites in the eastern United States to estimate the form and magnitude of the site-specific trend (defined as percent total change) from 1989 to 1995. This analysis is designed to adjust the SO2 data for the influences of meteorology and season. In the second stage, the estimated trends are treated as samples with site-dependent measurement error from a Gaussian random field with a stationary covariance function. Kriging methodology is adapted to construct spatially-smoothed estimates of the true trend for three large regions in the eastern U.S. Finally, a Bayesian analysis with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is used to obtain regional trend estimates and their standard errors, which take account of the estimation of the unknown covariance parameters as well as the stochastic variation of the random fields. Both spatial estimation techniques produced similar results in terms of regional trend and standard error.

Several detection schemes and algorithms have been proposed; however, this problem has not been satisfactory solved and remains the main error source for accurate automatic detection and classification of supraventricular arrhythmias, mainly in ambulatory applications and in coronary care units. Some detection methods have been proposed, but none of them have been quantitatively tested or compared, due in part to the lack of a database with annotated P-waves. In this work, a classification stage is proposed as a new decision strategy to improve a P-wave detector previously developed in our laboratory. A quantitative evaluation of the original detector, the proposed classification stage and two other classical P-wave detectors is performed by means of the calculation of their receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Results show the increased performance provided by the new classification stage with respect to the originally developed algorithm and two classical P-wave detection methods. © 2000 The Institute of Measurement and Control.","<b>Evaluation and Comparison of EEG Traces: Latent Structure in Nonstationary Time Series<\/b><br><br>We explore and illustrate the use of time series decomposition methods for evaluating and comparing latent structure in nonstationary electroencephalographic (EEG) traces obtained from depressed patients during brain seizures induced as part of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Analysis of the patterns of change over time in the frequency structure of such EEG data provides insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms of action of this effective but poorly understood antidepressant treatment, and allows clinicians to modify ECT treatments to optimize therapeutic benefits while minimizing associated side effects. Our work has introduced new methods of time-frequency analysis of EEG series that identify the complete pattern of time evolution of frequency structure over the course of a seizure, and usefully assist in these scientific and clinical studies. New methods of decomposition of flexible dynamic models provide time domain decompositions of individual EEG series into collections of latent components in different frequency bands. This allows us to explore ECT seizure characteristics via inferences on the time-varying parameters that characterize these latent components, and to relate differences in such characteristics across seizures to differences in the therapeutic effectiveness and cognitive side effects of those seizures. This article discusses the scientific context and problems, development of nonstationary time series models and new methods of decomposition to explore time-frequency structure, and aspects of model fitting and analysis. We include applied studies on two datasets from recent clinical ECT studies. One is an initial illustrative analysis of a single EEG trace, the second compares the EEG data recorded during two types of ECT treatment that differ in therapeutic effectiveness and cognitive side effects. The uses of these models and time series decomposition methods in extracting and contrasting key features of the seizure underlying the EEG signals are highlighted. Through the use of these models we have quantified, for the first time, decreases in the dominant frequencies of low-frequency EEG components during ECT seizures. We have also identified preliminary evidence that such decreases are enhanced under the more effective ECTs at higher electrical dosages, a finding consistent with prior reports and the hypothesis that more effective forms of ECT are more effective in eliciting neurophysiological inhibitory processes. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","<b>Lithologic tomography: From plural geophysical data to lithology estimation<\/b><br><br>The information provided by different geophysical data sets (gravimetric, magnetic, seismic, etc.) can be used, together with petrophysical and geostatistical information, to estimate the major lithological properties of the rocks within the studied volume. The formalization of this inverse problem requires a joint representation and parameterization of the different media properties in the model. The information relating rock properties together couples the inversion of the plural geophysical data sets and allows one to relate the observations with the lithological parameters of the model. The representation by probability density functions (pdfs) of the different types of information entering the problem is also required and provides the mathematical framework to formulate their combination. The resulting joint posterior pdf is composed of two factors: the joint likelihood function, which is the product of independent likelihood functions associated with each geophysical data set, and the joint prior pdf. The latter decomposes, following a partition of the model parameter space in a primary (lithological) subspace and secondary (physical) subspace, as a marginal pdf over the primary model parameter space and a conditional plover the secondary model parameter space. A Markov-chain Monte Carlo method was adapted to sample joint models from the posterior pdf: (1) the method starts with a Markov-chain sampling primary models from the marginal prior pdf, (2) the chain is extended to the joint model space, by sampling from the conditional pdf of the secondary parameters with respect to the primary parameters, and (3) it is modified to sample from the posterior pdf, by applying the Metropolis rule, which uses the evaluation of the joint likelihood function to accept or reject model transitions in the sampling chain. Finally, posterior marginal or posterior conditional pdfs for the model parameters or the model properties can be straightforwardly calculated from the set of joint models sampled by the chain.

The problem of modelling rainfall accumulated over fixed periods of time and recorded at meteorological stations at different sites is studied by using a model based on the assumption that the data follow a truncated and transformed multivariate normal distribution. The spatial correlation is modelled by using an exponentially decreasing correlation function and an interpolating surface for the means. Missing data and dry periods are handled within a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework using latent variables. We estimate the amount of rainfall as well as the probability of a dry period by using the predictive density of the data. We considered a model based on a full second-degree polynomial over the spatial co-ordinates as well as the first two Fourier harmonics to describe the variability during the year. Predictive inferences on the data show very realistic results, capturing the typical rainfall variability in time and space for that region. Important extensions of the model are also discussed.","<b>A stochastic model for tropical rainfall at a single location<\/b><br><br>Modelling data that correspond to rainfall accumulated over fixed periods of time presents the challenging problem of dealing with a random variable that has a point mass at zero which corresponds to dry periods that occur with positive probability.

The dry periods correspond to the (unobserved) negative values and the wet periods correspond to some power of the positive ones. The serial structure that is present in rainfall can be modelled by imposing a serial structure to w. We use a dynamic linear model on w using a Fourier representation to allow for the seasonality of the data, which in the case of tropical rainfall is very marked. The model is fitted using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method that uses latent variables to handle both dry periods and missing values.

Bayesian analysis was used to establish the cutoff between positive and negative sera. In order to determine the assessment of the ELISA test, the results obtained were compared with those from an IFA. A relative sensibility of 98.39%, a specificity of 95.12% and a predictive value of 96.83% were determined. The standardized technique was used to evaluate the antibody production against trypanosome in an experimentally infected equine, in which the sera converted 15 days after infection.

They are shown to lead to sensible approximations in two examples of meta-analyses and to be in broad agreement with the more computationally intensive Gibbs sampling.","<b>An automatic Bayesian procedure for likelihoods with shifted origin<\/b><br><br>An automatic Bayesian method for analysing irregular likelihoods with shifted unknown origin is proposed. Our procedure makes use of Bayesian marginalization by integration of parameters and of a convenient grouped likelihood function. The method is illustrated for the Weibull 3 likelihood and for the difficult situation of a shifted power transformation. Atkinson, Pericchi and Smith developed a grouped likelihood procedure for the shifted power transformation and conjectured that grouping the likelihood should have beneficial effects for Bayesian inference also. In this papers conjecture is shown to be correct. Moreover, by analysing two sets of data, it is illustrated that our Bayesian procedure is both more informative regarding the shifted origin and more robust with respect to the truncation factor than grouped likelihood methods that have previously been proposed.","<b>Direct speech feature estimation using an iterative EM algorithm for vocal fold pathology detection<\/b><br><br>The focus of this study is to formulate a speech parameter estimation algorithm for analysis/detection of vocal fold pathology. The speech processing algorithm proposed estimates features necessary to formulate a stochastic model to characterize healthy and pathology conditions from speech recordings. The general idea is to separate speech components under healthy and assumed pathology conditions. This problem is addressed using an iterative maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation procedure, based on the estimation-maximization (EM) algorithm. A new feature for characterizing pathology, termed enhanced-spectral-pathology component (ESPC), is estimated and shown to vary consistently between healthy and pathology conditions. It is also shown that the mean-area-peak-value (MAPV) and the weighted-slope (WSLOPE) indexes, which are obtained from the ESPC estimate, are meaningful measures of speech pathology conditions. For classification purposes, a five- state hidden-Markov-model (HMM) recognizer was formulated, based on the MAPV, WSLOPE, and ESPC spectral features. A set of log Mel-frequency filter bank coefficients were used to parameterize the ESPC feature. An evaluation of the HMM-based classifier was performed using speech recordings from healthy and vocal fold cancer patients of sustained vowel sounds. It is shown that while both MAPV and WSLOPE are useful features for vocal fold pathology detection, superior performance was achieved using a finer spectral representation of ESPC (e.g., a detection rate of 88.7% for pathology and 92.8% for healthy condition). One main advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require direct estimation of the glottal flow waveform. Therefore, the limitation of the inability to characterize vocal fold pathology, due to incomplete glottal closure, is no longer an issue. The results suggest that general analysis of the ESPC feature can provide a quantitative, noninvasive approach for analysis, detection, and characterization of speech production under vocal fold pathology.\nThe purpose of this study is to formulate a speech parameter estimation algorithm for analysis/detection of vocal fold pathology.

This has led Bayesians to use conventional proper prior distributions or crude approximations to Bayes factors. In this article we introduce a new criterion called the intrinsic Bayes factor, which is fully automatic in the sense of requiring only standard noninformative priors for its computation and yet seems to correspond to very reasonable actual Bayes factors. The criterion can be used for nested or nonnested models and for multiple model comparison and prediction. From another perspective, the development suggests a general definition of a “reference prior” for model comparison.

ST-T trends are processed by means of a Bayesian forecasting approach using the multistate Kalman filter. A complete procedure, intended for use in CCU/ICU monitoring areas, is proposed, in order to give the clinician an intelligent monitoring tool. The approach serves to describe trends and their changes in a symbolic way. A novel aspect is its ability to observe certain features of ST-T elevation/depression not detected by other means, and to reject artefacts and erroneous events. A sensivity of 89.58% and a predictivity of 84.31% are obtained on selected records of the European ST-T database. Using a restriction on event amplitude, the predictivity is raised to 95.55%. An ischaemia sensitivity index of 1·2 was determined.

The computation of the Jeffreys priors for one or two fixed marginals is then straightforward for the canonical parameter. Jeffreys priors are proper distributions, despite of the fact that the parameter spaces are unbounded. Coupling the Jeffreys prior with exponential likelihoods thus yields a proper and automatic Bayesian analysis.

This weakness has been traced to the inability of minimal models to reflect certain implicit preferences among defaults, in particular, preferences for defaults grounded on more 'specific' information and preferences arising in causal domains. Recently, 'specificity' preferences have been explained in terms of conditionals. Here we aim to explain causal preferences. We draw mainly from ideas known in Bayesian Networks to formulate and formalize two principles that explain the basic preferences that arise in causal default reasoning. We then define a semantics based on those principles and show how variations of the algorithms used for inheritance reasoning and temporal projection can be used to compute in the resulting formalism.","<b>Large classes of proper priors for linear models<\/b><br><br>We consider the problem of a hierarchical linear model with normal likelihood and variance known in the case where there is very little information about the hyperparameters.

In this article we suggest that a convenient and simple way to incorporate model robustness is to consider a discrete set of competing sampling models, and combine it with a suitable large class of priors. This set reflects foreseeable departures of the base model, like thinner or heavier tails or asymmetry. We combine the models with different classes of priors that have been proposed in the vast literature on Bayesian robustness with respect to the prior. Also we explore links with the related literature of stable estimation and precise measurement theory, now with more than one model entertained. To these ends it will be necessary to introduce a procedure for model comparison that does not depend on an arbitrary constant or scale.

This class allows considerable freedom in tail behaviour as long as the upper and lower measures have different tails. This property is inherited from the class of Interval of measures DeRobertis and Hartigan (1981), from which the Band of probability measures class is obtained by restricting attention to those measures that integrate to one, Although the analysis of this restricted class is somewhat more involved, the restriction is quite natural and may lead to robustness in situations in which the larger class is not robust. In fact, it is a generalization of the class implicitly considered by Edwards, Lindman and Savage (1963) in \"Precise Measurement Theory\". An empirical analysis is performed with the two classes above. That is, we choose within a class of priors that measure which maximizes the probability of the actual data Good (1983).

Here π0(θ|λ) is the base elicited prior, λ is a vector of fixed hyperparameters, q is a contamination belonging to some suitable class Q and ε reflects the amount of error in π0(θ|λ). For the location-scale family of priors π0(θ|λ=τ-1π0[(θ-μ)/τ}], where λ=(μ,τ), it turns out that the posterior inference is highly sensitive to changes of λ. Therefore, instead of considering a single base prior π0, it is reasonable to replace π0(θ;|λ) by π0(θ|λ1)=∝π0(θ|λ1,λ2)h(dλ2), where λ1 is the 'known' part of λ and λ2 is the 'uncertain' part, with the uncertainty reflected by allowing hε{lunate}H (H being a class of probability measures).

The basic principles of the Bayesian method for drawing inferences are outlined step-by-step. It is shown how Bayesian estimators of return values for wave heights are established by taking an expectation over all parameters and contending distributions. When the Bayesian procedure is applied to large data sets, such as wave data sets, computational difficulties could be encountered, making a \"remedial\" procedure necessary.

We claim that the explanation is that the standard procedure inflates the posterior probability of the model that has the smallest expected increase in information about its parameters. We then propose to modify it by an amount related to the expected gain in information, and show that the 'Lindley paradox' does not occur.

a significant share of the chemicals, current bioassays mispredicted the outcomes in the reference methods they simulate. For any drug or chemical, and depending on the regulatory or corporate situation, three different approaches calculate the numerical probability by which agreement (or discrepancy) can be statistically expected between (1) the result of a predictive bioassay, and (2) the outcome on its reference method. If such concordance is expected with enough confidence based on a sufficient percentage probability, then specific results from that bioassay can be considered as correctly predictive. The statistical approaches analyzed in this article assist in valuable tasks, including (1) a better translation of the clinical relevance (or insignificance) of specific preclinical findings; (2) waiving unnecessary animal testing (or any other unpredictive testing; e.g., a given in vitro bioassay), and (3) in advancing only the most promising candidates in the pharmaceutical, pesticide, or chemical development process.

These countries are characterized by a heterogeneous malaria landscape and malaria hotspots. Furthermore, the political unrest in Venezuela has led to significant cross-border population movement. Hence, the aim of this study was to describe spatial patterns and identify significant climatic drivers of malaria transmission along the Venezuela-Brazil-Guyana border, focusing on Bolivar state, Venezuela and Roraima state, Brazil. Malaria case data, stratified by species from 2016 to 2018, were obtained from the Brazilian Malaria Epidemiology Surveillance Information System, the Guyana Vector Borne Diseases Program, the Venezuelan Ministry of Health, and civil society organizations. Spatial autocorrelation in malaria incidence was explored using Getis-Ord (Gi*) statistics. A Poisson regression model was developed with a conditional autoregressive prior structure and posterior parameters were estimated using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with Gibbs sampling. There were 685,498 malaria cases during the study period. Plasmodium vivax was the predominant species (71.7%, 490,861). Malaria hotspots were located in eight municipalities along the Venezuela and Guyana international borders with Brazil. Plasmodium falciparum increased by 2.6% (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.1%, 2.8%) for one meter increase in altitude, decreased by 1.6% (95% CrI 1.5%, 2.3%) and 0.9% (95% CrI 0.7%, 2.4%) per 1 cm increase in 6-month lagged precipitation and each 1 °C increase of minimum temperature without lag. Each 1 °C increase of 1-month lagged maximum temperature increased P. falciparum by 0.6% (95% CrI 0.4%, 1.9%). P. vivax cases increased by 1.5% (95% CrI 1.3%, 1.6%) for one meter increase in altitude and decreased by 1.1% (95% CrI 1.0%, 1.2%) and 7.3% (95% CrI 6.7%, 9.7%) for each 1 cm increase of precipitation lagged at 6-months and 1 °C increase in minimum temperature lagged at 6-months. Each 1°C increase of two-month lagged maximum temperature increased P. vivax by 1.5% (95% CrI 0.6%, 7.1%). There was no significant residual spatial clustering after accounting for climatic covariates. Malaria hotspots were located along the Venezuela and Guyana international border with Roraima state, Brazil. In addition to population movement, climatic variables were important drivers of malaria transmission in these areas. © 2022, The Author(s).","We use 1.5 years of continuous recordings from an amphibious seismic network deployment in the region of northeastern South America and the southeastern Caribbean to study the crustal and uppermost mantle structure through a joint inversion of surface-wave dispersion curves determined from ambient seismic noise and receiver functions. The availability of both ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) and land stations makes this experiment ideal to determine the best processing methods to extract reliable empirical Green's functions (EGFs) and construct a 3D shear velocity model. Results show EGFs with high signal-to-noise ratio for land-land, land-OBS and OBS-OBS paths from a variety of stacking methods. Using the EGF estimates, we measure phase and group velocity dispersion curves for Rayleigh and Love waves. We complement these observations with receiver functions, which allow us to perform an H-k analysis to obtain Moho depth estimates across the study area. The measured dispersion curves and receiver functions are used in a Bayesian joint inversion to retrieve a series of 1D shear-wave velocity models, which are then interpolated to build a 3D model of the region. Our results display clear contrasts in the oceanic region across the border of the San Sebastian-El Pilar strike-slip fault system as well as a high-velocity region that corresponds well with the continental craton of southeastern Venezuela. We resolve known geological features in our new model, including the Espino Graben and the Guiana Shield provinces, and provide new information about their crustal structures. Furthermore, we image the difference in the crust beneath the Maturín and Guárico sub-basins.

We propose a Bayesian dynamic estimation of the hedonic regression model in which the estimated coefficients can be time-varying, demonstrated with an application of art prices. Our dynamic linear regression model overcomes the problems associated with traditional rolling-window based OLS (which represent ad hoc approximations to dynamic estimation), such as under or over-estimation of parameter values and non-adaptive window sizes to account for time-variability. Using a sample of 27,124 paintings sold at auction from 63 Pop-artists (2001–2013), we demonstrate that the estimated coefficients associated with commonly used art attributes fluctuate noticeably through time, and that certain types of artworks and artists might be regarded as “safer” investments (as their art experiences smaller maximum drawdowns), based on price dynamics during the financial crisis (2008–09). © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","In this paper, we propose a structured additive regression (STAR) model for modeling the occurrence of a disease in fields or nurseries. The methodological approach involves a Gaussian field (GF) affected by a spatial process represented by an approximation to a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF). This modeling allows the building of maps with prediction probabilities regarding the presence of a disease in plants using Bayesian kriging. The advantage of this modeling is its computational benefit when compared with known spatial hierarchical models and with the Bayesian inference based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Inference through the use of the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) with the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach facilitates the handling of large datasets in excellent computation times. Our approach allows the evaluation of different sampling strategies, from which we obtain inferences and prediction maps with similar behaviour to those obtained when we consider all subjects in the study population. The analysis of the different sampling strategies allows us to recognize the relevance of spatial components in the studied phenomenon. We demonstrate how Bayesian kriging can incorporate sources of uncertainty associated with the prediction parameters, which leads to more realistic and accurate estimation of the uncertainty. We illustrate the methodology with samplings of Citrus macrophylla affected by the tristeza virus (CTV) grown in a nursery. © 2022 by the authors.","Background: Environmental degradation facilitates the emergence of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, through changes in the ecological landscape that increase human–vector contacts and that expand vector habitats. However, the modifying effects of environmental degradation on climate–disease relationships have not been well explored. Here, we investigate the rapid re-emergence of malaria in a transmission hotspot in southern Venezuela and explore the synergistic effects of environmental degradation, specifically gold-mining activity, and climate variation. Methods: In this spatiotemporal modelling study of the 46 parishes of the state of Bolívar, southeast Venezuela, we used data from the Venezuelan Ministry of Health including population data and monthly cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and Plasmodium vivax malaria between 1996 and 2016. We estimated mean precipitation and temperature using the ERA5-Land dataset and used monthly anomalies in sea-surface temperature as an indicator of El Niño events between 1996 and 2016. The location of suspected mining sites in Bolívar in 2009, 2017, and 2018 were sourced from the Amazon Geo-Referenced Socio-Environmental Information Network. We estimated measures of cumulative forest loss and urban development by km2 using annual land cover maps from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative between 1996 and 2016. We modelled monthly cases of P falciparum and P vivax malaria using a Bayesian hierarchical mixed model framework. We quantified the variation explained by mining activity before exploring the modifying effects of environmental degradation on climate–malaria relationships. Findings: We observed a 27% reduction in the additional unexplained spatial variation in incidence of P falciparum malaria and a 23% reduction in P vivax malaria when mining was included in our models. The effect of temperature on malaria was greater in high mining areas than low mining areas, and the P falciparum malaria effect size at temperatures of 26·5°C (2·4 cases per 1000 people [95% CI 1·78–3·06]) was twice as high as the effect in low mining areas (1 case per 1000 people [0·68–1·49]). Interpretation: We show that mining activity in southern Venezuela is associated with hotspots of malaria transmission. Increased temperatures exacerbated malaria transmission in mining areas, highlighting the need to consider how environmental degradation modulates climate effect on disease risk, which is especially important in areas subjected to rapidly rising temperatures and land-use change globally. Our findings have implications for the progress towards malaria elimination in the Latin American region. Our findings are also important for effectively targeting timely treatment programmes and vector-control activities in mining areas with high rates of malaria transmission.

A study of the effects of perceived ethical behavior of brands in Colombia during the initial months of the COVID-19 outbreak was conducted in May 2020 in Bogota, Colombia, to ascertain customer perception of brand ethical actions during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 outbreak. A Bayesian model was developed to assess the impact of brands' ethical behavior on brand recognition benefits, brand image, and brand commitment. The selection of the initial months of the outbreak for this project was important because the COVID-19 pandemic had the potential to augment consumer perception of brands' ethical actions at a pivotal moment in consumers' lives. Our findings demonstrate that customers expressed a positive perception of brands' ethical actions during the early months of the pandemic, which resulted in high commitment intention to these brands in the model examined. The findings highlight the critical nature of the perception of ethical behavior in the eyes of customers during a major global health crisis. More than ever, organizations must commit their brands to fully live out their publicly expressed ethical principles and continuously monitor consumer perceptions of brand attributes and behaviors associated with ethical actions regardless of market conditions. Commitment to living the brand's stated ethical principles can be demonstrated via branding activities in ways that can be especially welcomed by customers during turbulent times. The insights mentioned in this article are crucial for brands already present in South America or exploring expansion into these regions. The findings provide compelling evidence of the impact of ethical actions on consumer commitment to brands, suggesting that brands must now, more than ever, stay in touch with their customers and truthfully live the ethical values they transmit to customers. © 2022, The Author(s).","Objective: To determine the genetic diversity of Aedes aegypti in the Central-Alto Paraná cross-border road corridor of Paraguay, an area that has reports of dengue cases. Materials and methods: Twenty adult females were selected from hatching Ae. aegypti eggs from households geolocated in the departments of Alto Paraná, Caaguazú, Cordillera and Central, between 2018 and 2019. DNA was extracted from the tissue of females for amplifying their polymorphic patterns by random amplification of polymorphic DNA by PCR (RAPD-PCR), using primers H3 and B03 in order to identify genetic parame-ters of population diversity. The relationships between mosquito populations according to locality were observed by unpaired arithmetic mean analysis. We used DIVA-GIS 7.3.0 and MAXENT to analyze the suitable areas of actual and potential geographic distribution of these Ae. aegypti populations. Results: Forty loci were identified by RAPD-PCR profiling, with moderate gene differentiation (Gst = 0.12). The cross-border corridor presented bioclimatic conditions for the presence of variant populations of Ae. aegypti, with precipitation in the warmest quarter and mean temperature in the driest quarter being determinant in the distribution. Conclusions: There is evidence of moderate genetic diversity in Ae. aegypti populations from areas that have reported dengue cases in the cross-border road corridor linking the Central and Alto Paraná departments of Paraguay. The study of genetic variability of Ae. aegypti is very useful for entomo-epidemiological surveillance and evaluation of possible resistance to chemical control. © 2022, Instituto Nacional de Salud.

We evaluated the potential role of the uplift of the Eastern Cordillera (EC) of the Colombian Andes and the Mérida Andes (MA) of Venezuela as drivers of vicariance between lowland populations co-distributed on both flanks. We synthesized published geological data and provided a new reconstruction showing that the EC-MA grew from north to south, reaching significant heights and separating drainages and changing sediment composition by 38–33 million years ago (Ma). A few lowland passes across the EC-MA may have reached their current heights (~1,900 m a.s.l.) at 3–5 Ma. We created a comparative phylogeographic data set for 37 lineages of lowland tetrapods. Based on molecular phylogenetic analyses, most divergences between sister populations or species across the EC-MA occurred during Pliocene and the Quaternary and a few during the latest Miocene, and coalescent simulations rejected synchronous divergence for most groups. Divergence times were on average slightly but significantly more recent in homeotherms relative to poikilotherms. Because divergence ages are mostly too recent relative to the geological history and too asynchronous relative to each other, divergence across the northern Andes may be better explained by organism-environment interactions concomitant with climate oscillations during the Pleistocene, and/or dispersal across portals through the Andes.

Recently, we observed higher semantic similarity in first-episode-schizophrenia (FES) patients. In this study, we investigate if this aberrant similarity relates to the ‘causal’ connectivity between two key nodes of the word production system: inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the semantic-hub at the ventral anterior temporal lobe (vATL). Methods: Resting-state fMRI scans were collected from 60 participants (30 untreated FES and 30 healthy controls). The semantic distance was measured with the CoVec semantic tool based on GloVe. A spectral dynamic causal model with Parametrical Empirical Bayes was constructed modelling the intrinsic self-inhibitory and extrinsic-excitatory connections within the brain regions. We estimated the parameters of a fully connected model with the semantic distance as a covariate. Results: FES patients chose words with higher semantic similarity when describing the pictures compared to the HC group. Among patients, an increased semantic similarity was related with an increase in intrinsic connections within both the vATL and IFG, suggesting that reduced ‘synaptic gain’ in these regions likely contribute to aberrant sampling of the semantic space during discourse in schizophrenia. Conclusions: Lexical impoverishment relates to increased self-inhibition in both the IFG and vATL. The associated reduction in synaptic gain may relate to reduced precision of locally generated neural activity, forcing the choice of words that are already ‘activated’ in a lexical network. One approach to improve word sampling may be via promoting synaptic gain via supra-physiological stimulation within the Broca's-vATL network; this proposal needs verification. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","The mathematical models can help to characterize, quantify, summarize, and determine the severity of the outbreak of the Coronavirus, the estimation of the dynamics of the pandemic helps to identify the type of measures and interventions that can be taken to minimize the impact by classified information. In this work, we propose four epidemiological models to study the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, two versions of the SIR model (Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered) are considered, the classical Crank-Nicolson method is used with a stochastic version of the Beta-Dirichlet state-space models. Subsequently, the SEIR model (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered) is fitted, the Euler method and a stochastic version of the Beta-Dirichlet state-space model are used. In the results of this study (Portoviejo-Ecuador), the SIR model with the Beta-Dirichlet state-space form determines the maximum point of infection in less time than the SIR model with the Crank-Nicolson method. Furthermore, the maximum point of infection is shown by the SEIR model, that is reached during the first two weeks where the virus begins to spread, more efficient is shown by this model. To measure the quality of the estimation of the algorithms, we use three measures of goodness of fit. The estimated errors are negligible for the analyzed data. Finally, the evolution of the spread is predicted, that can be helpful to prevent the capacity of the country’s health system. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","This manuscript builds on a novel, automatic, freely-available Bayesian approach to extract information in abstracts and titles to classify research topics by quartile. This approach is demonstrated for all N= 149,129 ISI-indexed publications in biological sciences journals during 2017. A Bayesian multinomial inverse regression approach is used to extract rankings of topics without the need of a pre-defined dictionary. Bigrams are used for extraction of research topics across manuscripts, and rankings of research topics are constructed by quartile. Worldwide and local results (e.g., comparison between two peer/aspirational research institutions in Colombia) are provided, and differences are explored both at the global and local levels. Some topics persist across quartiles, while the relevance of others is quartile-specific. Challenges in sustainable development appear as more prevalent in top quartile journals across institutions, while the two Colombian institutions favour plant and microorganism research. This approach can reduce information inequities, by allowing young/incipient researchers in biological sciences, especially within lower income countries or universities with limited resources, to freely assess the state of the literature and the relative likelihood of publication in higher impact journals by research topic. This can also serve institutions of higher education to identify missing research topics and areas of competitive advantage. © 2022-IOS Press.

This work proposes the combination of a multi-label classifier, Circular Classifier Chain (CCC), with a multimodal classifier, Fusion using a Semi-Naive Bayesian classifier (FSNBC), to include explicitly the dependencies between multiple affective states during the automatic recognition process. This combination of classifiers is applied to a virtual rehabilitation context of post-stroke patients. We collected data from post-stroke patients, which include finger pressure, hand movements, and facial expressions during ten longitudinal sessions. Videos of the sessions were labelled by clinicians to recognize four states: tiredness, anxiety, pain, and engagement. Each state was modelled by the FSNBC receiving the information of finger pressure, hand movements, and facial expressions. The four FSNBCs were linked in the CCC to exploit the dependency relationships between the states. The convergence of CCC was reached by 5 iterations at most for all the patients. Results (ROC AUC) of CCC with the FSNBC are over 0.940±0.045 (±std.deviation) for the four states. Relationships of mutual exclusion between engagement and all the other states and co-occurrences between pain and anxiety were detected and discussed. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","The objective of the present work was to develop species-specific microsatellite markers for P. scalare and to analyze the diversity and genetic structure of a wild population, from the Amazon River, and three commercial stocks (common, marble, and clown morphological variants), from farmers in Vieras-Minas Gerais. Through microsatellite-enriched genetic libraries, 11 microsatellite markers with adequate amplification patterns were characterized. Population genetic analysis identified eight polymorphic loci that generated 66 alleles ranging from two alleles (PSCA1B3) to nine (PSCA2H1). The polymorphic information content ranged from 0.031 to 0.827. High genetic differentiation was observed between the wild population and the stocks, and moderate differentiation between the three stocks. Deviation in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed in one locus in the wild population, in five loci in the common morphological variant, in two in the marble, and in two in the clown morphological variant. Bayesian analysis of genetic structure revealed the existence of two clusters, one represented by the natural population and the other by the stocks. The developed microsatellite markers serve as a tool for the analysis of diversity and genetic structure and conservation studies of P. scalare. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","The preclinical identification of health hazards relies on the performance (the historic concordance to the respective gold standard) of regulatorily recommended bioassays. However, any testing with less than 100% sensitivity (or 100% specificity) can deliver false results (outcomes discordant to the respective gold standard). Conversely, the predictive values approach (a.k.a. Bayesian forecasting) weighs (1) the performance of the predictive bioassay (battery, or framework) with (2) the prevalence of -positivity to the respective gold standard- in the most representative category to which the test substance can be allocated. Thus, the predictive values approach (PVA) provides the numeric probability for the toxicity to humans of chemicals that, circumstantially, are evaluable only through nonclinical data. Consequently, the PVA improves the predictivity of nonclinical toxicology, and increases the impact of hazard identifications entirely based on preclinical data. This article aimed to introduce the PVA through a worked example. Due to their toxicological homogeneity and public health relevance, the superfamily of colorants synthesized from benzidine (BZ) or some mutagenic congeners was selected (colorings hereafter mentioned as BZ-related-colorants). Through the PVA, the numeric probability of innate carcinogenicity to humans of 259 BZ-related-colorants was either estimated from rodent carcinogenesis bioassays (RCBs) or predicted from methods alternative to the RCB. A discussion was provided on (1) some limitations and implications of the PVA, and (2) the probable significance of the predictive values figured here for 259 BZ-related-colorings. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","The star formation history and the internal dynamics of Milky Way satellite galaxies are often complicated. In the last years, a substantial fraction of the known faint dwarf satellites have been studied. Some of them show embedded stellar substructures, such as star clusters and even globular star clusters. In this work, we study Eridanus II, a dwarf spheroidal satellite that hosts a star cluster, using published and archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys. We employ a Bayesian hierarchical method to infer the star formation history of Eridanus II. We find that the bulk of the stars in Eridanus II are very old ($13.5_{-1}^{+0.5}$ Gyr) and quite metal-poor (Z = 0.000 01). We do not find any evidence of the presence of an intermediate age or young population in Eri II. We cannot date the embedded star cluster as a separate entity, but we find it likely that the cluster has a similar age and metallicity as the bulk of the stars in Eri II. The existence of an old star cluster in a dark matter dominated old metal-poor dwarf galaxy is of major importance to cast light on the dark matter distribution within dwarf galaxies. The existence of intermediate age stars is required by the recent detection of carbon stars in Eri II. Since no recent star formation is detected, blue-straggler fusions of lower mass stars are the most likely origin of the carbon star progenitors. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.","The automatic detection of a heartbeat is commonly performed by detecting the QRS complex in the electrocardiogram (ECG), however, various noise sources and missing data can jeopardize the reliability of the ECG. Therefore, there is a growing interest in combining the information from many physiological signals to accurately detect heartbeats. To this end, hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used in this work to jointly exploit the information from ECG, arterial blood pressure (ABP) and pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) signals in order to conceive a heartbeat detector. After preprocessing the physiological signals, a sliding window is used to extract an observation sequence to be passed through two HMMs (previously trained on a training dataset) in order to obtain the log-likelihoods of observation and signals a detection if the difference of log-likelihoods exceeds an adaptive threshold. Several HMM-based heartbeat detectors were conceived to exploit the information from the ECG, ABP and PAP signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2014, and MGH/MF Waveform databases. A grid search methodology was used to optimize the duration of the observation sequence and a multiplicative factor to form the adaptive threshold. Using the optimal parameters found on a training database through 10-fold cross-validation, sensitivity and positive predictivity above 99% were obtained on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2014 databases, while they are above 95% in the MGH/MF waveform database using ECG and ABP signals. Our detector approach showed detection performances comparable with the literature in the three databases. © 2021, Korean Society of Medical and Biological Engineering.","For several intended uses of chemicals, the 2-year rodent bioassay (RCB) has been the benchmark method to screen the carcinogenicity to humans of substances, according to the hazard identification sphere. Despite the ongoing controversy around this traditional testing, the RCB is in force and being used by stakeholders. After assembling the RCB's ability to forecast the carcinogenicity to humans of substances, the current review aimed to provide a discussion on the RCB's (1) sensitivity and specificity; (2) utility; (3) configuration, and (4) provisional role in the regulatory policy. In general, RCBs conducted at maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) exhibited a functional ability to (1) not missing the great majority of human carcinogens, and to (2) not responding to the large majority of human non-carcinogens. There is citable evidence supporting the use of MTDs to render RCBs as sensitive as possible, particularly provided the ethically-justified small samples used in RCBs. The literature shows that rodent-specific mechanisms of chemical carcinogenesis contribute significant unspecificity to RCBs. Nonetheless, the paradox between a functional sensitivity and a significant unspecificity can be predictively resolved through the application of Bayesian forecasting. In terms of performance to forecast the carcinogenicity to humans of either genotoxic or non-genotoxic substances, 2-species-RCBs added no value over the rat-RCB. Nevertheless, there is preliminary evidence cautioning that 15% of the rodent carcinogens probably carcinogenic to humans could be missed if mouse-RCBs are indiscriminately discontinued. More than thirteen RCB-related issues relevant to regulatory pharmacology and toxicology were discussed and summarized in this review. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","This article proposes the use of computationally efficient inverse regression Bayesian method for analysis of tweet propagation of political messages. Our example focuses on the Colombian case, though our method can be used in any election where social media messaging has a direct impact on political outcomes. We find strong evidence that politicians were able to identify the combination of sensitive words to enhance the probability of retweet of the message, which, in turn, had an impact on political outcomes. The contributions of our work entail: (a) an examination of a neglected unit of analysis (trigram) in a language less studied (i.e. Spanish), (b) based on an innovative Bayesian efficient approach and (c) exploiting the predictive power that retweets have on electoral results as an informational diffusion tool in social media. A practical implication of this new methodology is the possibility to adjust political messages as a means to increase voters engagement in political campaigns. © The Author(s) 2019.","We explore the shear-wave lithospheric velocity structure of the Eastern Caribbean and Northern Venezuela using ambient noise tomography with stations deployed around the study area. We construct cross-correlation functions from continuous seismic records, and measure phase velocities of fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves. These velocities are further projected onto 0.6°x0.6° phase velocity grids for each period between 5 s and 50 s. The pseudo-dispersion curve at each grid point is inverted for 1D shear velocity profiles by using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme. The interpolated 3D velocity model shows that the mean shear velocity of the Eastern Caribbean lithospheric mantle is lower than the global average, which is in agreement with values reported in other large igneous provinces. We interpret that low velocities in the lithospheric keel are associated with an anomalous composition and/or an elevated thermal state; this gives the Caribbean plate a high buoyancy that determines the subduction polarities in the region. The results also indicate that: (a) the mantle beneath Northern Venezuela retains compositional anomalies related to extension processes of different ages; (b) the overriding of the Caribbean plate by the Great Antilles arc seems to be much slower than previously suggested; and (c) the localized volcanism in the center of the Lesser Antilles arc is related to asthenospheric flow through the tear induced on the subducted slab by major strike-slip faults. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","We analysed the phylogeographic structure of five resident bird lineages distributed in the seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) of Mesoamerica to test whether they show patterns of synchronous and geographically coincident genetic divergence during the Quaternary. We generated phylogenetic trees, estimated divergence times and analysed the genetic structure of populations (based on sequences of mitochondrial genes), as well as estimating historical distributions (range extension and areas of long-term climate stability) during the Late Pleistocene. We tested and selected the phylogeographic divergence scenarios that best explain the current divergence patterns of taxa using the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach. For most species, phylogenetic trees and haplotype networks showed a clear genetic structure associated with geographical distribution. Overall, the divergence times ranged from 0.29-2.0 Mya, suggesting that diversification of populations occurred at different times during the Pleistocene. The palaeodistribution models predicted at least two areas of climatic stability within the current SDTF that probably allowed glacial-interglacial persistence of isolated bird populations along the Mexican Pacific, thus promoting their genetic divergence. The results provide information relevant to the identification of diversification hotspots for the Mesoamerican SDTF avifauna. © 2021 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.","The geographical distribution and ecological niche of the two circulating species of the Sporothrix genus in Venezuela was established. For this, 68 isolates of Sporothrix spp. from patients of different regions of the country were analyzed. A molecular taxonomy analysis was conducted using a fragment of the calmodulin gene (CAL), and ITS regions, confirming the presence of S. schenckii (62%) and S. globosa (38%). Computational models of ecological niche for each species were obtained by the maximum entropy method using the MaxEnt software, which predicted the best environmental conditions for the presence of the two species. These models predict that the main variables influencing the presence of S. schenckii were altitude and annual mean temperature, while for S. globosa, the more influent variable was the land use, with 82% of S. globosa located at urban areas vs 56% for S. schenckii. The results here presented could contribute to understand the specific environmental factors that might modulate the occurrence of Sporothrix spp. as well as its transmission. To our knowledge, our analyses show for the first time Sporothrix spp.–specific ecological niche data, a valuable tool to promote evidence-based public health policymaking within endemic areas of sporotrichosis. © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.","The severe acute respiratory syndrome pandemic by SARS-CoV-2 is caused, millions of confirmed cases and a high number of deaths are reported, the population dynamics are altered, a strong socio-economic impact, the collapse in the health system, the collapse in the education system, unemployment, are caused, among others. In this work, a logistic regression model is proposed, the dynamics of deaths in the period of the pandemic is modeled, two computational algorithms IVDA and NUTS are implemented, the posterior distribution in high dimensions is generated. The interpretation of the parameters is important, that to the variable of deaths from COVID-19 or no COVID-19 are related. The algorithms through real data are illustrated, the proposed model with adequately and reliably of the dynamic of the randomness of the deceased is shown. To measure the relative success of the algorithms, three goodness-of-fit measures are estimated. Obtaining small errors. © 2021, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

Information on the geographic and genetic origin of these stocks is important to guide actions that allow correct management in captivity and, when lost, harm production and genetic conservation. In this sense, the objective of this study was to evaluate the genetic diversity and origin of two breeding stocks of matrinxã, Brycon amazonicus (INPA, Amazonas - INPA and Nova Motum, Mato Grosso - NM). A total of 68 caudal fin samples were collected, including 33 INPA samples and 35 NM samples. Twenty pairs of microsatellite primers were tested, but only seven primers showed satisfactory amplification, amplifying 41 alleles ranging from 187-318 bp. The polymorphic information content ranged from 0.135 (Borg25) to 0.782 (Bh6). Exclusive alleles were observed for both populations (INPA: 04 and NM: 18). Allelic richness results revealed that there was increased loss of genetic variation in NM, indicating a lower evolutionary potential of this stock. The average values of the observed heterozygosity corroborated this statement; however, there were high values for INPA (0.545) and NM (0.475), signifying an adequate genetic variability. An imbalance was found in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the Borg59 locus in INPA (P < 0.05), possibly due to the effect of null alleles, but was attributed to a founder effect. For NM, an imbalance in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed at loci BoM13 and Bh6, which together with the results of the mean inbreeding coefficient values demonstrated the presence of genetic drift. The analysis of molecular variance showed greater variation within populations than between them, and was confirmed by the genetic differentiation value (0.086 - moderate genetic differentiation) and by the distance and genetic identity values (0.273 and 0.761, respectively). Bayesian analysis designated a value of K = 2, with the presence of structuring for NM and INPA; however, with correlated allelic frequencies, confirming a common origin. This origin was corroborated by the presence of gene flow through the number of migrants (5.691). Based on these results, there was a moderate genetic variability for INPA and NM and their common origin was confirmed. Recommendations are also included to minimize the probability of inbreeding processes or genetic drift in the studied stocks.. © 2021 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

The history of the Milky Way galaxy is written in stone in this data set. Parallaxes and photometry tell us where the stars are today, when were they formed, and with what chemical content, that is, their star formation history (SFH). We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model suited to reconstruct the SFH of a resolved stellar population. We study the stars brighter than $G\\, =\\, 15$ within 100 pc of the Sun in Gaia DR2 and derive an SFH of the solar neighbourhood in agreement with previous determinations and improving upon them because we detect chemical enrichment. Our results show a maximum of star formation activity about 10 Gyr ago, producing large numbers of stars with slightly below solar metallicity (Z = 0.014), followed by a decrease in star formation up to a minimum level occurring around 8 Gyr ago. After a quiet period, star formation rises to a maximum at about 5 Gyr ago, forming stars of solar metallicity (Z = 0.017). Finally, star formation has been decreasing until the present, forming stars of Z = 0.03 at a residual level. We test the effects introduced in the inferred SFH by ignoring the presence of unresolved binary stars in the sample, reducing the apparent limiting magnitude, and modifying the stellar initial mass function. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.","Aquatic food webs in tropical rivers are affected by spatial and temporal variations in basal resources and the composition of consumer assemblages. We used stable isotope analysis to estimate seasonal variation in basal resources supporting fish biomass in zones along the longitudinal gradient of the Usumacinta River Basin, the largest of Mesoamerica. A Bayesian isotope mixing model was used to estimate the proportional contributions of six basal resources: seston, filamentous algae, periphyton, aquatic macrophytes, riparian C3 plants and C4 plants. Models estimated that fish in the upper zone were largely supported by periphyton and riparian C3 plants during the dry season and by filamentous algae during the wet season. In the dry season, fishes in the middle and lower zones assimilated material derived from seston and, to a lesser extent, periphyton, whereas aquatic macrophytes were more important during the wet season. Chlorophyll-a measurements from the middle and lower zones suggested that seston contained large fractions of suspended algae. These patterns are consistent with the river wave concept, which predicts flow-associated changes in contributions of basal resources to the aquatic food web. The findings of this study reinforce the major role of flow regime in the ecological dynamics of rivers and how these dynamics vary depending on location and local conditions within fluvial networks. © 2021 CSIRO.","This paper develops a framework for the analysis of state-space models combined with Kalman and smoothed Kalman filters for the estimation of unknown states, and parameters, determining the accuracy of the algorithms, with the purpose of analyzing some time series of the macroeconomy of Ecuador. This methodology plays an important role in the area of economics and finance and has many advantages because it allows describing how observed macroeconomic variables can be related to potentially unobserved state variables, determining the evolution in real time, estimating unobserved trends, changes of structures and make forecasts in future times. To achieve the objectives, three models are proposed: the first model is used to estimate the Ecuador’s gross domestic product. The second model combines a state space model with the classic ARIMA (p, q, r) model to adjust the GDP rate and finally it is considered a model for the simultaneous stress time series analysis related to: consumer price index, industrial production index and active interest rate. In all the cases studied, the estimates obtained reflect the real behavior of the Ecuadorian economy. The square root of the mean square error was used as a measure of goodness of fit to measure the quality of estimation of the algorithms, obtaining small errors. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","In this article, an estimation methodology based on the sequential Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed, that jointly estimate the states and parameters, the relationship between the prices of futures contracts and the spot prices of primary products is determined, the evolution of prices and the volatility of the historical data of the primary market (Gold and Soybean) are analyzed. Two stochastic models for an estimate the states and parameters are considered, the parameters and states describe physical measure (associated with the price) and risk-neutral measure (associated with the markets to futures), the price dynamics in the short-term through the reversion to the mean and volatility are determined, while that in the long term through markets to futures. Other characteristics such as seasonal patterns, price spikes, marketdependent volatilities, and non-seasonality can also be observed. In the methodology, a parameter learning algorithm is used, specifically, three algorithms are proposed, that is the sequential Monte Carlo estimation (SMC) for state space models with unknown parameters: the first method is considered a particle filter that is based on the sampling algorithm of sequential importance with resampling (SISR). The second implemented method is the Storvik algorithm [19], the states and parameters of the posterior distribution are estimated that have supported in low-dimensional spaces, a sufficient statistics from the sample of the filtered distribution is considered. The third method is (PLS) Carvalho's Particle Learning and Smoothing algorithm [31]. The cash prices of the contracts with future delivery dates are analyzed. The results indicate postponement of payment, the future prices on different maturity dates with the spot price are highly correlated. Likewise, the contracts with a delivery date for the last periods of the year 2017, the spot price lower than the prices of the contracts with expiration date for 12 and 24 months is found, opposite occurs in the contracts with expiration date for 1 and 6 months. © 2021 International Academic Press.

In this article, we consider two motion models for a civilian aircraft: a constant velocity model and a coordinated turn model. Both kinematics models are written in state-space terms, where the velocity perturbations are modeled by a white noise acceleration model. In order to estimate the aircraft states given noisy measurements obtained from sensor outputs, we follow a Bayesian statistical approach that calculates the estimators of the unknown states. In our simulation, we recreate an air traffic control scenario and implement two nonlinear filtering algorithms in order to perform target tracking of the aircraft. The nonlinear Bayesian-based filters for this target tracking problem are the unscented Kalman filter and the Gauss-Hermite Kalman filter. Finally, the performance of both nonlinear filters is evaluated with a performance metric, root mean squared error, in Monte-Carlo runs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","The relationship between research topics and academic prestige of journals is of relevance to assess venues for current research as well as trending areas of new research. This is of special relevance for those developing a research agenda or with defined productivity outcome expectations. This manuscript extracts prevalent topics using titles and abstracts from more than 10,000 manuscripts, constituting all published research in International Scientific Indexing (ISI) journals within the oral health specialties of oral surgery, orthodontics, and periodontics during 2018. Journals are clustered across four quartile categories according to their impact factors. The novelty of our work includes (a) an examination of a neglected unit of analysis (bigram) in oral health sciences which is of higher relevance than single-word topic definitions and (b) the use of an efficient Bayesian hierarchical approach to extract and rank topics across quartiles with information borrowing. Some topics persisted across quartile groups, while others show higher prevalence in specific quartiles, indicating that topics may find some journal quartiles a more appropriate venue for publication. All quartile groups show a prevalence of empirical research. The approach described in this manuscript offers the possibility to adjust/generate research agendas based on research topic prevalence and dynamics. This methodology is relevant for researchers looking to define their research agendas with potential outcomes aligned with the expectations of quantity and quartile set by their home institutions. It also serves researchers to assess most likely quartiles for publication of their work. © The Author(s) 2021.","Brazil is the world largest producer and exporter of Coffea arabica. In this country, numerous breeding programs have generated a great multiplicity of cultivars with expressive productivity that are adapted to the different regions. Evaluating genetic diversity is critical since it provides parameters for defining breeding strategies. We estimated the genetic diversity among and within 32 cultivars of the Brazilian Coffee Trial using AFLP markers. This trial is composed of the main cultivars developed and some under development by Empresa De Pesquisa Agropecuaria do Estado de Minas Gerais (EPAMIG), Fundação PROCAFÉ, Instituto Agronômico de Campinas (IAC), and Instituto de Desenvolvimento Rural do Paraná (IDR-Paraná). A total of 982 AFLP fragments were generated, of which 97.35% were polymorphic. The percentage of polymorphic loci ranged from 22.8 to 50.5%, with genetic diversity varying from 0.06 to 0.16. Variable levels of genetic diversity observed among cultivars probably derived from the diverse germplasm sources and methods used in the genetic breeding programs, the number of advanced generations of each cultivar, as well as genetic recombination or cross-fertilization during breeding programs. Bayesian cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and Neighbor-Net showed three divergent genetic groups, with a high genetic differentiation index (FST = 0.46). The pairwise FST also revealed high divergence among cultivars. IDR-Paraná had the cultivars with the highest genetic variability among these four Brazilian coffee breeding centers. We found that AFLP markers allowed us to distinguish the cultivars/progenies in the Brazilian National Trial. We conclude that Brazilian coffee germplasm still has considerable genetic variability for the development of new cultivars with high productivity, resistance to disease, superior beverage quality, and adaptation to diverse edaphoclimatic conditions in the different producing regions. © FUNPEC-RP.","This paper presents a steady-state comparison of two methods that generate an orthogonal voltage system for a single-phase Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) structure: a widely accepted one based on a Second Order Generalized Integrator (SOGI) and a new one based on a All-Pass Filter (APF) with Lattice structure. Both methods are very attractive because of their simple digital implementation, low computational load and good performance under harmonically distorted grid conditions and variable frequency, so they are a good alternative to other known methods. The paper derives and analyzes the full state space models of the two methods. It is shown that these two methods are equivalent in the most common operation conditions of distributed energy resources, although the APF structure is clearly better than the SOGI one because it maintains its orthogonal generation ability for any higher notch frequencies and any lower sampling frequencies. The comparative analysis were validated by simulation using MATLAB=Simulink and experimental results using a fixed-point DSP. © 2021 ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING.","Sonic seasoning refers to the way in which music can influence multisensory tasting experiences. To date, the majority of the research on sonic seasoning has been conducted in Europe or the USA, typically in a within-participants experimental context. In the present study, we assessed the applicability of sonic seasoning in a large-scale between-participants setting in Asia. A sample of 1611 participants tasted one sample of chocolate while listening to a song that evoked a specific combination of cross-modal and emotional consequences. The results revealed that the music’s emotional character had a more prominent effect than its cross-modally corresponding attributes on the multisensory tasting experience. Participants expressed a higher buying intention for the chocolate and rated it as having a softer texture when listening to mainly positive (as compared to mainly negative) music. The chocolates were rated as having a more intense flavor amongst those participants listening to ‘softer’ as compared to ‘harder’ music. Therefore, the present study demonstrates that music is capable of triggering a combination of specific cross-modal and emotional effects in the multisensory tasting experience of a chocolate. © 2020 by the authors.

This change of paradigm in the construction of test plans for lot acceptance provides optimal inspection schemes from both frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. Classes of admissible test plans minimizing the weighted-average risks are first defined. Constrained optimization problems are then solved in order to determine sample sizes with smallest classical or expected weighted-average risks, as well as acceptance test plans with minimal inspection effort and controlled risks. The proposed methodology to determine optimal sample sizes and decision criteria for lot sentencing constitutes a plausible consensus between Frequentists and Bayesians. Moreover, the use of prior information on the fraction defective allows the practitioners to appreciably reduce the required sample size for lot screening. Optimal lot inspection schemes can also be easily updated using past performance of the sampling plans. Besides the advantages the suggested approach has for hypothesis testing, namely large sample consistency and reproducible results, it permits to make a trade-off between the opposite goals of customers and manufacturers. Some applications in reliability demonstration testing and industrial quality control are presented for illustrative purposes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","This article proposes a methodology that involves the Universal Kriging filter (UKF) and the Kalman filter (KF) to study temporal-space dynamic models. Spatial prediction surfaces are constructed using the UKF and the KF is used to estimate the temporal effects. The UKF provides a successful estimation approach from the point of view of spatial statistics, while the KF describes a well-established recursive procedure to estimate the states and parameters in these models. The methodology is illustrated using 30-year time series of 3 meteorological stations in Ecuador. The model allows to make predictions on temperature, precipitation and humidity, obtaining estimates of unknown states very similar when compared to original series. The root mean square error was used as a measure of goodness of fit to measure the estimation quality of the algorithm, obtaining satisfactory results. © 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

Available information on patterns of genetic differentiation in C. acutus shows a complex structuring influenced by interspecific interactions (mainly hybridization) and anthropogenic actions (mostly historical hunting, recent poaching, habitat loss and fragmentation, and unintentional translocation of individuals). In this study, we used data on mitochondrial DNA control region and 11 nuclear polymorphic microsatellite loci to assess the degree of population structure of C. acutus in South America, North America, Central America and the Greater Antilles. We used traditional genetic differentiation indices, Bayesian clustering and multivariate methods to create a more comprehensive picture of the genetic relationships within the species across its range. Analyses of mtDNA and microsatellite loci show evidence of a strong population genetic structure in the American crocodile, with unique populations in each sampling locality. Our results support previous findings showing large degrees of genetic differentiation between the continental and the Greater Antillean C. acutus. We report three new haplotypes unique to Venezuela, which are considerably less distant from the Central and North American haplotypes than to the Greater Antillean ones. Our findings reveal genetic population differentiation between Cuban and Jamaican C. acutus and offer the first evidence of strong genetic differentiation among the populations of Greater Antillean C. acutus.

Four states: Anxiety, pain, engagement and tiredness (either physical or psychological), were hypothesized to be inferable from observable metrics of hand location and gripping strength-relevant for rehabilitation. Contributions are; (a) multiresolution classifier built from Semi-Naïve Bayesian classifiers, and (b) establishing predictive relations for the considered states from the motor proxies capitalizing on the proposed classifier with recognition levels sufficient for exploitation. 3D hand locations and gripping strength streams were recorded from 5 post-stroke patients whilst undergoing motor rehabilitation therapy administered through virtual rehabilitation along 10 sessions over 4 weeks. Features from the streams characterized the motor dynamics, while spontaneous manifestations of the states were labelled from concomitant videos by experts for supervised classification. The new classifier was compared against baseline support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) with all three exhibiting comparable performances. Inference of the aforementioned states departing from chosen motor surrogates appears feasible, expediting increased personalization of virtual motor neurorehabilitation therapies. © 2018 IEEE.","In the Neotropics, the distribution of Capparaceae has been historically associated with seasonally dry forest (NSDF), but recent taxonomic studies have questioned this assumption. Given the environmental co-occurrence of species and the need to understand their relationships with the ecosystem, we use ecological niche modelling and numerical ecology methods to better describe the distribution patterns of Capparaceae and their climatic affinities with NSDF. We used the Maxent algorithm to model the ecological niches of 104 species of Capparaceae, which gave maximum values of the response curves for climatic suitability. These values were used to carry out multivariate statistical analyses [principal components analysis (PCA), non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and discriminant analysis (DA)] to identify ecological associations based on climatic similitude among species. Both PCA and NMDS showed that annual precipitation, precipitation of the wettest quarter and precipitation of the driest quarter were the most important climatic variables shaping distributions of species and their associations with NSDF, moist tropical forest (MTF) and wet tropical forest (WTF). Although we found 72 species associated with NSDF as previously reported, DA revealed an overlapping pattern among the three ecological/climatic assemblages (NSDF, MTF and WTF). This confirms the existence of transition zones and species with wider niches. Our results provide an important biogeographical framework of ecological patterns for species associated with NSDF, opening new lines of research on the reconstruction of distribution in future climatic scenarios or palaeo-distributions. © 2020 Crown copyright 2020.","Background: Malaria incidence has reached staggering numbers in Venezuela. Commonly, Bolívar State accounted for approximately 70% of the country cases every year. Most cases cluster in the Sifontes municipality, a region characterized by an extractive economy, including gold mining. An increase in migration to Sifontes, driven by gold mining, fueled a malaria spillover to the rest of the country and the region. Here samples collected in 2018 were compared with a previous study of 2003/2004 to describe changes in the parasites population structures and the frequency of point mutations linked to anti-malarial drugs. Methods: A total of 88 Plasmodium falciparum and 94 Plasmodium vivax isolates were collected in 2018 and compared with samples from 2003/2004 (106 P. falciparum and 104 P. vivax). For P. falciparum, mutations linked to drug resistance (Pfdhfr, Pfdhps, and Pfcrt) and the Pfk13 gene associated with artemisinin delayed parasite clearance, were analysed. To estimate the multiplicity of infection (MOI), and perform P. falciparum and P. vivax population genetic analyses, the parasites were genotyped by using eight standardized microsatellite loci. Results: The P. falciparum parasites are still harbouring drug-resistant mutations in Pfdhfr, Pfdhps, and Pfcrt. However, there was a decrease in the frequency of highly resistant Pfdhps alleles. Mutations associated with artemisinin delayed parasite clearance in the Pfk13 gene were not found. Consistent with the increase in transmission, polyclonal infections raised from 1.9% in 2003/2004 to 39% in 2018 in P. falciparum and from 16.3 to 68% in P. vivax. There is also a decrease in linkage disequilibrium. Bayesian clustering yields two populations linked to the time of sampling, showing that the parasite populations temporarily changed. However, the samples from 2003/2004 and 2018 have several alleles per locus in common without sharing multi-locus genotypes. Conclusions: The frequency of mutations linked with drug resistance in P. falciparum shows only changes in Pfdhps. Observations presented here are consistent with an increase in transmission from the previously circulating parasites. Following populations longitudinally, using molecular surveillance, provides valuable information in cases such as Venezuela with a fluid malaria situation that is affecting the regional goals toward elimination. © 2020 The Author(s).","This manuscript proposes a new approach for unveiling existing linkages within the international oil market across multiple driving factors beyond production. A multilayer, multicountry network is extracted through a novel Bayesian graphical vector autoregressive model, which allows for a more comprehensive, dynamic representation of the network linkages than do traditional or static pairwise Granger-causal inference approaches. Building on previous work, the layers of the network include country-and region-specific oil production levels and rigs, both through simultaneous and lagged temporal dependences among key factors, while controlling for oil prices and a world economic activity index. The proposed approach extracts relationships across all variables through a dynamic, cross-regional network. This approach is highly scalable and adjusts for time-evolving linkages. The model outcome is a set of time-varying graphical networks that unveil both static representations of world oil linkages and variations in microeconomic relationships both within and between oil producers. An example is provided, illustrating the evolution of intra-and inter-regional relationships for two major interconnected oil producers: the United States, with a regional decomposition of its production and rig deployment, and the Arabian Peninsula and key Middle Eastern producers, with a country-based decomposition of production and rig deployment, while controlling for oil prices and global economic indices. Production is less affected by concurrent changes in oil prices and the overall economy than rigs. However, production is a lagged driver for prices, rather than rigs, which indicates that the linkage between rigs and production may not be fully accounted for in the markets. © 2020 Royal Economic Society.

In this regard, policy and decision makers require accurate tools for risk estimation in order to take informed decisions. This work proposes a Bayesian framework for a unified treatment and statistical modeling of the main components of risk: hazard, vulnerability and exposure. Risk is defined as the expected economic loss or population affected as a consequence of a hazard event. The vulnerability is interpreted as the loss experienced by an exposed population due to hazard events. The framework combines data of different spatial and temporal supports. It produces a sequence of temporal risk maps for the domain of interest including a measure of uncertainty for the hazard and vulnerability. In particular, the considered hazard (rainfall) is interpolated from point-based measured rainfall data using a hierarchical spatio-temporal Kriging model, whose parameters are estimated using the Bayesian paradigm. Vulnerability is modeled using zero-inflated distributions with parameters dependent on climatic variables at local and large scales. Exposure is defined as the total population settled in the spatial domain and is interpolated using census data. The proposed methodology was applied to the Vargas state of Venezuela to map the spatio-temporal risk for the period 1970–2006. The framework highlights both high and low risk areas given extreme rainfall events. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Introduction: Through this article, a new procedure for the valuation of shares is documented, through business financial multiples, but with the support of statistical techniques for the future projection of scenarios, tools for simulation, and even Bayesian models of continuous valuation of relative indicators in time. Objective: Develop a financial statistical technique to assess share price in the secondary market in the medium term. Materials and Methods: This methodology introduces a new concept of valuation, combining the traditional technique of financial multiples with the probabilistic simulation of future scenarios through the use of Risk Simulator and finally the creation of a percentage indicator to estimate the share price in the secondary market, by means of a Bayesian dynamic linear model of these previous simulations. Results: In this work five phases were documented, which begin with an analysis of the information provided by Bloomberg in the Colombian electricity sector companies (ISAGEN, CELSIA and ISA), and then generate a structure through the use of multiples financial policies defined and documented for its application. Based on this structural information, the variables used in the valuation for the future five years (until 2020) were projected, with the purpose of calculating the financial multiples of the theoretical results and being able to perform Monte Carlo simulations based on established probability distributions for each causal variable, according to their historical behavior. Conclusions: Finally, with these values of the financial multiples determined through the simulation, and the real price of the share in the market, the Relative Comparison Indicator (IRC) is calculated, which will present historical values, offering support for making projections through a Bayesian Dynamic Linear Model, in order to forecast in the medium term the average annual share value for each company in the electricity sector in Colombia (ISAGEN, CELSIA and ISA) during the years 2016 to 2020. © 2020 Corporacion Universitaria Lasallista.

It is becoming increasingly difficult to operate exclusively in one of these two environments. While physical stores provide retailers with a unique opportunity to deliver unique in-store experiences that can also leverage their online features, online retailers are also establishing a presence in the physical world to supplement the experience offered online. Therefore, understanding how consumers behave in each of these environments and how these behaviors are expressed across both worlds has become increasingly important to marketers managing omnichannel operations. Only by providing a complete experience to the consumer from all possible contact points will retailers be able to achieve their omnichannel goals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Customer experience (CX) is an aggregate of consumer touch points that can be brand-owned (completely controlled by the firm), partner-owned (collectively controlled by the firm and one or more of its partners), customer-owned (where the firm or its partner cannot exert any control or influence) or represented by social/external touch points that account for the importance of the roles of others in the customer experience process. Although the concept of CX is widely used, not much has been examined about how external touch points impact customer perception of experience. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to examine the role and impact of internal and external touchpoints as dimensions of customer experience and how CX can impact consumer word-of-mouth intention. Service outcome and peace of mind were used to represent internal experience touchpoints and peer to peer quality (PTP) was used to represent an external experience touchpoint. A total of 293 usable surveys were used for analysis using a Bayesian model developed for this study instead of the more traditional SEM approaches. Results showed that an external experience touchpoint has a similar impact to those of internal experience touchpoints in the experience process. CX was also found to have a strong effect on customer word of mouth intention. These findings make various contributions to the literature on CX, especially to research differentiating internal from external experience touchpoints. On the practical side, this study provides recommendations to retailers about how to manage an external touchpoint. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","The phase spectrum is an important characteristic of earthquake motion. Although amplitude and phase spectrum is essential to simulate an earthquake motion, the arrival time of a wave component with frequency and the distribution width of the group delay time are related to the duration of the time history of the wave component, its modeling is much easier than direct modeling of phase spectrum. In this paper, a stochastic differential equation (SDE) was considered to simulate the group delay time (GDT) of earthquake ground motion. A brief review of probabilistic Bayesian methods (Monte Carlos Sequential Methods) to handle earthquake data is presented. A methodology based on recursive algorithms is proposed that allows estimating and predict the magnitudes of seismic events from the time, location and magnitude of the event past. To approximate the solution of the stochastic differential equation, the Euler-Maruyama and Milstein structures were defined. New approaches for collective analysis of the data and an engineering model for the source are discussed with a few numerical results. © 2019","The Amazonian fish Tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) is the most common native species in Brazil. This species has the highest production rate in the Northern region, especially in the State of Rondônia. The genetic evaluation of Tambaqui is an extremely important to increase productivity in fish farms or improve the adaptability in restocking natural populations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the genetic diversity of three Tambaqui broodstocks in Rondônia, Brazil. Six microsatellite markers were used to analyze a total of 89 breeders collected from three fish farms located in Ji-Paraná (JP), Ouro Preto do Oeste (OP) and Presidente Médici (PM). A total of 37 alleles between 140 and 310 bp were found, including the presence of exclusive and low frequency alleles in the three broodstocks. The average values of observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.404 (PM) to 0.499 (JP). The FIS coefficient values were positive for the three broodstocks, demonstrating a deficit of heterozygotes. The Molecular Variance Analysis (AMOVA) showed greater variation within the stocks than between them. The genetic differentiation was moderate and significant between the stocks, with higher differentiation between JP x PM and lower between OP x PM. The Bayesian analysis designated an optimal value of K = 3 groupings. Although there is moderate genetic diversity between broodstocks, the high FIS indicates a possible decline of diversity in the next generations, and therefore, the incorporation of new breeders is suggested to increase the genetic diversity in the three stocks. © 2020 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

Urea, sodium benzoate and an enzyme-bacterial inoculant were used as treatments. Four samples from each treatment were incubated in rumen on four sheep. Effective degradability was estimated for ruminal passage rate of 2%, 5% and 8% hour-1. Bayesian procedures were used to estimate potential degradation parameters in situ. The high moisture triticale silage with urea showed highest value for the soluble fraction (70.46%) and the best effective dry matter degradability, with a passing rate of 2% h-1 (90.63%), of control silage at other rates of passage. In relation to control silage, the addition of sodium benzoate and enzyme-bacterial inoculant decreased the effective degradability of dry matter, regardless of rate passage evaluated. Due to high solubility of urea, the silage added with this additive had the highest soluble fraction of crude protein (76.42%). The addition of enzyme-bacterial inoculant accelerated the ruminal passage rate of dry matter and protein to 0.26 and 0.20% h-1, respectively, providing less potential degradability of both in relation to other silages. As enzyme-bacterial inoculation reduces rumen degradability of crude protein, it tends to increase the availability of amino acids for intestinal absorption. The addition of urea to high moisture triticale silage may be recommended for sheep feeding at a low level of consumption, as it improves the effective dry matter degradability. © 2020 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

In this paper is proposed two statistical models based on a system of stochastic differential equations (SDE) that model the dynamics of population growth, and three computational algorithms that allow the generation of probability distribution samples in high dimensions, in models that have non-linear structures and that are useful for making inferences. The algorithms allow to estimate simultaneously states solutions and parameters in SDE models. The interpretation of the parameters is important because they are related to the variables of growth, mortality, migration, physical-chemical conditions of the environment, among other factors. The algorithms are illustrated using real data from a sector of the population of the Republic of Ecuador, and are compared with the results obtained with the models used by theWorld Bank for the same data, which shows that stochastic models Proposals based on an SDE more adequately and reliably adjust the dynamics of demographic randomness, sampling errors and environmental randomness in comparison with the deterministic models used by the World Bank. It is observed that the population grows year by year and seems to have a definite tendency; that is, a clearly growing behavior is seen. To measure the relative success of the algorithms, the relative error was estimated, obtaining small percentage errors. © 2020 International Academic Press.","The detection of the heartbeat from electrocardiographic (ECG) and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals, either exploited individually or jointly, has been carried out successfully using different approaches that range from the use of simple digital signal processing techniques until the use of more advanced techniques based on machine learning. In this paper, we employed a heartbeat detector that uses two hidden Markov models (HMM) to characterize the dynamics of the presence and the absence of heartbeats in ECG and ABP signals. The HMM-based detector can exploit univariate observations (ECG or ABP signals) or bivariate observations (ECG an ABP signals jointly, in a centralized manner). Two transformations of the signals were applied as a preprocessing step: absolute value and squared functions. In this sense, six detectors based on univariate observations and nine detectors based on bivariate observations were conceived and validated in ten records of the MGH/MF Waveform Database. The detection performance when the absolute value of ECG and the absolute value of ABP are jointly exploited by the HMM produced T P = 58736, FN = 631, FP = 788, sensitivity = 98.73%, positive predictivity = 98.22%). © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Mathematical models that try to describe these phenomena have nonlinear structures, observations are made at discrete time points and include measurement errors, and are difficult to estimate. In particular, when modeling dynamics of repeated measurements on individuals or objects, they are analyzed by mixed-effects diffusion models. The standard estimation methods in these cases are: maximum likelihood, EM, SAEM, Newton Raphson, among others. In this paper we propose a specific inference methodology for models. Apply extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to the estimation of both states and parameters of nonlinear state-space models. To illustrate the methodology, the states and parameters of an Ornstein- Uhlembeck (O-U) mixed-effects model were estimated, obtaining precise estimates with small standard deviations. To measure the estimation quality of the algorithms was used as a measure of goodness-of-fit known as the square root of the mean quadratic error, obtaining very small errors. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","The detection of heartbeats is a fundamental task in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. In a clinical setting, heartbeats are commonly detected from the electrocardiographic (ECG) signal, but it can also be estimated from hemodynamic signals, such as arterial blood pressure (ABP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and central venous pressure (CVP). In this paper, we conceived three HMM-based detectors that jointly exploit the information from ECG and ABP ($$ D_{ECG \\& ABP}$$ ), ECG and PAP ($$ D_{ECG \\& PAP}$$ ), and ECG and CVP ($$ D_{ECG \\& CVP}$$ ). The HMM-based detectors are based on the comparison of the difference of log-likelihoods of observation of two competing models that learned the dynamics of the presence and absence of a heartbeat, respectively. The detection performances of the bivariate centralized detectors were similar, but the detector that simultaneously considers ECG and ABP provide the best result (sensitivity = 98.91% and positive predictivity = 99.11%). These results agree when a univariate HMM-based detector only considers the ECG signal in the decision process. The centralized bivariate detection approach proposed in this paper make uses of redundant information in the decision process and is particularly useful when one of the signals is too noisy or missing. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Dendrocincla woodcreepers are ant-following birds widespread throughout tropical America. Species in the genus are widely distributed and show little phenotypic variation. Notwithstanding, several subspecies have been described, but the validity of some of these taxa and the boundaries among them have been discussed for decades. Recent genetic evidence based on limited sampling has pointed to the paraphyly of D. fuliginosa, showing that its subspecies constitute a complex that also includes D. anabatina and D. turdina. In this study we sequenced nuclear and mitochondrial markers for over two hundred individuals belonging to the D. fuliginosa complex to recover phylogenetic relationships, describe intraspecific genetic diversity and provide historical biogeographic scenarios of diversification. Our results corroborate the paraphyly of D. fuliginosa, with D. turdina and D. anabatina nested within its recognized subspecies. Recovered genetic lineages roughly match the distributions of described subspecies and congruence among phylogenetic structure, phenotypic diagnosis and distribution limits were used to discuss current systematics and taxonomy within the complex, with special attention to Northern South America. Our data suggest the origin of the complex in western Amazonia, associated with the establishment of upland forests in the area during the early Pliocene. Paleoclimatic cycles and river rearrangements during the Pleistocene could have, at different times, both facilitated dispersal across large Amazonian rivers and the Andes and isolated populations, likely playing an important role in differentiation of extant species. Previously described hybridization in the headwaters of the Tapajós river represents a secondary contact of non-sister lineages that cannot be used to test the role of the river as primary source of diversification. Based on comparisons of D. fuliginosa with closely related understory upland forest taxa, we suggest that differential habitat use could influence diversification processes in a historically changing landscape, and should be considered for proposing general mechanisms of diversification. © 2019","Triatomines are the vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Although Triatoma and Rhodnius are the most-studied vector genera, other triatomines, such as Panstrongylus, also transmit T. cruzi, creating new epidemiological scenarios. Panstrongylus has at least 13 reported species but there is limited information about its intraspecific genetic variation and patterns of diversification. Here, we begin to fill this gap by studying populations of P. geniculatus from Colombia and Venezuela and including other epidemiologically important species from the region. We examined the pattern of diversification of P. geniculatus in Colombia using mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal data. Genetic diversity and differentiation were calculated within and among populations of P. geniculatus. Moreover, we constructed maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference phylogenies and haplotype networks using P. geniculatus and other species from the genus (P. megistus, P. lignarius, P. lutzi, P. tupynambai, P. chinai, P. rufotuberculatus and P. howardi). Using a coalescence framework, we also dated the P. geniculatus lineages. The total evidence tree showed that P. geniculatus is a monophyletic species, with four clades that are concordant with its geographic distribution and are partly explained by the Andes orogeny. However, other factors, including anthropogenic and eco-epidemiological effects must be investigated to explain the existence of recent geographic P. geniculatus lineages. The epidemiological dynamics in structured vector populations, such as those found here, warrant further investigation. Extending our knowledge of P. geniculatus is necessary for the accurate development of effective strategies for the control of Chagas disease vectors. © 2019 Caicedo-Garzón et al.","The automatic recognition of multiple affective states can be enhanced if the underpinning computational models explicitly consider the interactions between the states. This work proposes a computational model that incorporates the dependencies between four states (tiredness, anxiety, pain, and engagement)known to appear in virtual rehabilitation sessions of post-stroke patients, to improve the automatic recognition of the patients' states. A dataset of five stroke patients which includes their fingers' pressure (PRE), hand movements (MOV)and facial expressions (FAE)during ten sessions of virtual rehabilitation was used. Our computational proposal uses the Semi-Naive Bayesian classifier (SNBC)as base classifier in a multiresolution approach to create a multimodal model with the three sensors (PRE, MOV, and FAE)with late fusion using SNBC (FSNB classifier). There is a FSNB classifier for each state, and they are linked in a circular classifier chain (CCC)to exploit the dependency relationships between the states. Results of CCC are over 90% of ROC AUC for the four states. Relationships of mutual exclusion between engagement and all the other states and some co-occurrences between pain and anxiety for the five patients were detected. Virtual rehabilitation platforms that incorporate the automatic recognition of multiple patient's states could leverage intelligent and empathic interactions to promote adherence to rehabilitation exercises. © 2019 IEEE.","The study of customer experience has gained substantial importance in the consumer behavior field because of how it impacts the development of long-term relationships with customers. The next frontier of customer experience research involves new contexts represented by new channels offered by retailers, thus sparking research interest in the experience lived by customers not only in physical stores but also in virtual stores as a clear representation of the concept of omni-channels. Within this context, consumers’ actions on social media are particularly important because they can act as product or service endorsements to other customers affecting their purchase intentions. In this article, we attempt to bridge the gap between real-world retail experiences and how they connect with the online retail environment through consumer behavior contrasting traditional and eWOM intention at the point of experience immediately after its consumption in a physical setting. In order to do so, a Bayesian hierarchical approach is used to provide an adaptable, low-sample statistical infrastructure for the analysis of the proposed relationships. Our findings show that customer experience in physical stores still have a higher impact on consumer traditional WOM intention than on eWOM intention. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","We present a Bayesian method to determine simultaneously the age, metallicity, distance modulus, and interstellar reddening by dust of any resolved stellar population, by comparing the observed and synthetic colour magnitude diagrams on a star by star basis, with no need to bin the data into a carefully selected magnitude grid. We test the method with mock stellar populations, and show that it works correctly even for scarce stellar populations with only one or two hundred stars above themain sequence turn-off. If the population is the result of two star formation bursts, we can infer the contribution of each event to the total stellar population. The code works automatically and has already been used to study massive amounts of Magellanic clouds photometric data. In this paper, we analyse in detail three Large Magellanic Cloud star clusters and six ultra faint dwarf galaxies. For these galaxies, we recover physical parameters in agreement with those quoted in the literature, age ~13.7 Gyr and a very low metallicity log Z ~ -4. Searching for multiple populations in these galaxies, we find, at a very low significance level, signs of a double stellar population for Ursa Major I: a dominant old population and a younger one which contributes ~25 per cent of the stars, in agreement with independent results from other authors. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.","Virtual rehabilitation platforms may tailor the rehabilitation tasks to the patients’ needs if they could recognize the patient’s affective state. Affective states recognition systems can enhance their performance if they receive data coming from different sensors of human behaviour. In this work, we propose a late Fusion using Semi-Naive Bayesian classifier (FSNB) as a multimodal affective states recognition system to infer four states: tiredness, anxiety, pain, and motivation, from observable metrics of fingers pressure, hand movements, and facial expressions of post-stroke patients. Data streams were recorded from 5 post-stroke patients while they attended virtual rehabilitation therapies along 10 sessions over 4 weeks, manifesting the aforementioned states spontaneously. Recognition rates of the FSNB classifier were over 90% (with a standard deviation of around ±0.06) of AUC for the four states. These results represent contributions for enhancing the development of affective states recognition systems in virtual rehabilitation. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","In this work we propose a methodology based on sequential Monte Carlos techniques for the estimation of dynamic systems states arising from the torque and drag phenomena of a directional drill string. This methodology arises from the need to consider the various mechanical factors and the geological parameters that influence the drift deviation, which conduce to no vertical drilling and phenomena of torque and drag. The anticipated model will acquire importance for the evaluation with the different efforts for which it will be in the next stage of the drill string. The methodology is exposed through the reconstruction of states of the synthetic model states proposed by Johancsik, Friesen, and Dawson, using the Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), observing good adjustment of torsion and drag states estimated by the filters with respect to the real values. Filters performance was evaluated in terms of the mean square error, showing variability of the estimated errors 0.05 for EnKF and 0.01 for UKF and a fast execution of the algorithms 3.07 (seg) for EnKF and 0.48 (seg) for UKF. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Most countries are concerned about the image they project in international markets. They have adopted and implemented differentiation strategies in order to stimulate tourism and economic investment. In the case of Colombia's reputation, it has been built on unplanned positioning, interests and views of a few opinion leaders, political and economic instability and transformations in the productive sector. This paper outlines, using a Bayesian variable selection approach, the perception of foreign visitors and prospects on Colombia's country image, and proposes a methodological framework for unvailing those driving factors. Findings of this research demonstrate that countries may be seen positively from the point of view of visitors while prospects may have a negative image of them. The results validate the hypothesis that the symbolic elements associated with a country's image, in this case with Colombia's image, should be included in the communication activities of a country branding strategy. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","In this work the methodology applied is based on Bayesian statistical methods inspired by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes, which simplifies the estimation and prediction process of the Markov switching model. The general objective of this study is to determine simultaneously: non-linearity, structural changes, asymmetries and outliers that are characteristics present in many financial series. The methodology is empirically illustrated using series that measure the annual growth rate of industrial production in the MERCOSUR countries. The sampling algorithm [1] is implemented to estimate the parameters of the model. The parameters were estimated in terms of expected values a posteriori and standard deviations a posteriori. Three criteria is used to assess the prediction model: square root of the mean quadratic error (RSME), the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test and the TRC statistical test. These measures of goodness-of-fit show, that the estimates have small errors. The execution time of the algorithm is calculated, observing high performance. As a result of the analysis of the data, it is concluded that there is no reduction of economic volatility and no reduction in the depth of economic cycles. At the breakpoints, atypical values and non-linearity in the data are observed. It also shows that there are no common economic cycles for the countries analyzed. © 2019 ASEPUMA.

Regarding the methodology, the research approach was quantitative; the type of descriptive-correlational study, and the research design was non-experimental.

To achieve this objective, new paradigms are necessary. The present work proposes the conception of an autonomic communication system, which is based on a Bayesian network and on an ontology, to take reconfiguration decisions in the system. The ontology provides the knowledge about the performance factors and their relationships in the communication networks, to configure the structure of the Bayesian network.

The risk neutral densities are computed through the second derivative, which we extend through a Bayesian approach to the problem, featuring an extension to a multivariate setting across maturities and over time, a flexible estimation approach for the smoothing parameter, which is traditionally assumed common to all assets, known and fixed across maturities and time, but now potentially different between assets and maturities, and over time, and information borrowing about the implied curves and risk neutral densities not only across different option maturities, but also dynamically. © 2018 Royal Statistical Society","This study aims to propose a method to generate growth and degrowth models using differential equations as well as to present a model based on the method proposed, compare it with the classic nonlinear mathematical models Logistic, Von Bertalanffy, Brody, Gompertz, and Richards, and identify the one that best represents the mean growth curve. To that end, data on Undefined Breed (UB) goats and Santa Inês sheep from the works of Cavalcante et al. (2013) and Sarmento et al. (2006a), respectively, were used. Goodness-of-fit was measured using residual mean squares (RMS), Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), mean absolute deviation (MAD), and adjusted coefficient of determination (Ra 2 ) . The models’ parameters (, weight at adulthood; , an integration constant; γ, shape parameter with no biological interpretation; k, maturation rate; and m, inflection point) were estimated by the least squares method using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm on the software IBM SPSS Statistics 1.0. It was observed that the proposed model was superior to the others to study the growth curves of goats and sheep according to the methodology and conditions under which the present study was carried out. © 2018 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

This study compares specific physicochemical properties of soil between C. guanhumi burrows (B) and adjacent zones (AZ), and provides the first insights on their role as an ecosystem engineer in mangroves. The study was conducted in an estuarine system dominated by Rhizophora mangle, located at the Río Chico estuary, Miranda state of Venezuela. Random soil samples were taken digging each burrow until reaching the bottom and at the same depth for AZ. Data analysis was carried out using Bayesian inference. Credible mean differences between B and AZ, were found for sand (B = 26.53 ± 10.76, AZ = 17.25 ± 5.7%), silt (B = 73.16 ± 10.77, AZ = 82.42 ± 5.69%), pH (B = 8.71 ± 0.36, AZ = 9.12 ± 0.30), soil organic matter (SOM, B = 0.43 ± 0.21, AZ = 0.17 ± 0.06%), total N (TN, B = 786 ± 232, AZ = 529 ± 107 µg g−1), Mg (B = 4.42 ± 0.60, AZ = 3.48 ± 0.71 cmolc kg−1) and K (B = 0.12 ± 0.05 AZ = 0.06 ± 0.02 cmolc kg−1). Chemical variables as SOM, K, Mg and TN showed the highest values of effect size (> 1.4). With the exception of the pH, all chemicals variables—which were different between B and AZ—showed strong and decisive evidences of correlations with SOM. When SOM variable was controlled, the relationships between pH–TN, TN–K and Mg–K decreased, even though the correlation evidence between each pair remained. Differences in chemical contents found in B respect to AZ suggest that the activities of C. guanhumi (feeding, moulting, excretion and defecation) within their burrows promote the spatial heterogeneity of mangrove soils. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","The identification of homeologous genomes and the biogeographical analyses of highly reticulate allopolyploid-rich groups face the challenge of incorrectly inferring the genomic origins and the biogeographical patterns of the polyploids from unreliable strictly bifurcating trees. Here we reconstruct a plausible evolutionary scenario of the diverging and merging genomes inherited by the diploid and allopolyploid species and cytotypes of the model grass genus Brachypodium. We have identified the ancestral Brachypodium genomes and inferred the paleogeographical ranges for potential hybridization events that originated its allopolyploid taxa. We also constructed a comprehensive phylogeny of Brachypodium from five nuclear and plastid genes using Species Tree Minimum Evolution allele grafting and Species Network analysis. The divergence ages of the lineages were estimated from a consensus maximum clade credibility tree using fossil calibrations, whereas ages of origin of the diploid and allopolyploid species were inferred from coalescence Bayesian methods. The biogeographical events of the genomes were reconstructed using a stratified Dispersal-Extinction-Colonization model with three temporal windows. Our combined Minimum Evolution-coalescence-Bayesian approach allowed us to infer the origins and the identities of the homeologous genomes of the Brachypodium allopolyploids, matching the expected ploidy levels of the hybrids. To date, the current extant progenitor genomes (species) are only known for B. hybridum. Putative ancestral homeologous genome have been inherited by B. mexicanum, ancestral and recent genomes by B. boissieri, and only recently evolved genomes by B. retusum and the core perennial clade allopolyploids (B. phoenicoides, B. pinnatum 4x, B. rupestre 4x). We dissected the complex spatio-temporal evolution of ancestral and recent genomes and have detected successive splitting, dispersal and merging events for dysploid homeologous genomes in diverse geographical scenarios that have led to the current extant taxa. Our data support Mid-Miocene splits of the Holarctic ancestral genomes that preceded the Late Miocene origins of Brachypodium ancestors of the modern diploid species. Successive divergences of the annual B. stacei and B. distachyon diploid genomes were implied to have occurred in the Mediterranean region during the Late Miocene-Pliocene. By contrast, a profusion of splits, range expansions and different genome mergings were inferred for the perennial diploid genomes in the Mediterranean and Eurasian regions, with sporadic colonizations and further mergings in other continents during the Quaternary. A reliable biogeographical scenario was obtained for the Brachypodium genomes and allopolyploids where homeologous genomes split from their respective diploid counterpart lineages in the same ancestral areas, showing similar or distinct dispersals. By contrast, the allopolyploid taxa remained in the same ancestral ranges after hybridization and genome doubling events. Our approach should have utility in deciphering the genomic composition and the historical biogeography of other allopolyploid-rich organismal groups, which are predominant in eukaryotes. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Hidden Markov models (HMM) are useful tools to characterize the dynamics of observation sequences. However, the duration of the observation sequence to characterize is often chosen empirically, based on a priori information. In this paper, we used a grid search approach to optimize two hyperparameters of an HMM-based QRS complex detector, namely, the duration of the observation sequence to be characterized and the adaptive decision threshold that compares the difference of log-likelihoods of observations from two competing HMM. To assure the reproducibility of the results, we have run the optimization process ten times using different random seeds per realization. Using the ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database, we have found an optimal adaptive decision threshold of 60% but the optimal value of the observation sequence duration varies from 100 ms to 120 ms for different realizations of the optimization process. Consequently, the different parameters of the HMM-based QRS complex detector found in each realization do not always lead to the same detection performance. Using the optimal values, the detector achieves a sensitivity of 96.53% and a positive predictivity of 98.16%. © 2018 Creative Commons Attribution.","We used a combination of public RR Lyrae star catalogues and a Bayesian methodology to derive robust structural parameters of the inner halo (<25 kpc) and thick disc of the MilkyWay. RR Lyrae stars are an unequivocal tracer of old metal-poor populations, for which accurate distances and extinctions can be individually estimated and so are a reliable independent means of tracing the population of the old high-[α/Fe] disc usually associated with the thick disc. In particular, the chosen RR Lyrae sample spans regions at low galactic latitude towards the anticentre direction, allowing to probe the outermost parts of the disc. Our results favour a thick disc with short-scale height and short-scale length, hz=0.65+0.09-0.05 kpc, hR = 2.1+0.82 -0.25 kpc, for a model in which the inner halo has a constant flattening of q = 0.90+0.05 -0.03 and a power-law index of n = -2.78+0.05 -0.05. Similar short scales for the thick disc are also found when considering an inner halo with flattening dependent on radius.We also explored a model in which the thick disc has a flare and, although this is only mildly constrained with our data, a flare onset in the inner ~11 kpc is highly disfavoured. © 2018 The Author(s).

The particularities of the DTC such as its behavior, its standard heuristic derivation, and its nature of been a nonlinear hysteresis-based predictive controller are exploited, thus allowing the improvement and development of alternative explanations to the phenomena. The understanding of DTC and the development of the current state-space model of the asymmetric IM, presented here for first time in the literature, enables the analytical treatment of the research topic and the discovery of several DTC reactions to the fault. The ITSC impact on DTC and its reaction leads to the following twofold characterizations: first, unobservable and visible effects, and second, compensation and tolerant reactions. For purposes of simulation, a plug-and-play configurable circuit-block for the asymmetric IM was developed based on Norton's equivalent circuit. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the assertiveness of the developed analyses and theoretical findings, which allows future research in online fault diagnostics and condition monitoring of inverter-fed IM with this type of fault. © 2018 IEEE.","Predictive coding and active inference formulations of the dysconnection hypothesis suggest that subjects with schizophrenia (SZ) hold unduly precise prior beliefs to compensate for a failure of sensory attenuation. This implies that SZ subjects should both initiate responses prematurely during evidence-accumulation tasks and fail to inhibit their responses at long stop-signal delays. SZ and healthy control subjects were asked to report the timing of billiards-ball collisions and were occasionally required to withhold their responses. SZ subjects showed larger temporal estimation errors, which were associated with premature responses and decreased response inhibition. To account for these effects, we used hierarchical (Bayesian) drift-diffusion models (HDDM) and model selection procedures to adjudicate among four hypotheses. HDDM revealed that the precision of prior beliefs (i.e., starting point) rather than increased sensory precision (i.e., drift rate) drove premature responses and impaired response inhibition in patients with SZ. From the perspective of active inference, we suggest that premature predictions in SZ are responses that, heuristically, are traded off against accuracy to ensure action execution. On the basis of previous work, we suggest that the right insular cortex might mediate this trade-off. © 2018 The Authors","In the electrocardiogram (ECG), the detection of QRS complexes is a fundamental step in the ECG signal processing chain since it allows the determination of other characteristics waves of the ECG and provides information about heart rate variability. In this work, an automatic QRS complex detector based on continuous density hidden Markov models (HMM) is proposed. HMM were trained using univariate observation sequences taken either from QRS complexes or their derivatives. The detection approach is based on the log-likelihood comparison of the observation sequence with a fixed threshold. A sliding window was used to obtain the observation sequence to be evaluated by the model. The threshold was optimized by receiver operating characteristic curves. Sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spc) and F1 score were used to evaluate the detection performance. The approach was validated using ECG recordings from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. A 6-fold cross-validation shows that the best detection performance was achieved with 2 states HMM trained with QRS complexes sequences (Sen = 0.668, Spc = 0.360 and F1 = 0.309). We concluded that these univariate sequences provide enough information to characterize the QRS complex dynamics from HMM. Future works are directed to the use of multivariate observations to increase the detection performance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","This study presents data and estimates reproductive parameters of the sailfish Istiophorus platypterus (Shaw, 1792) in the western Atlantic, useful for future stock assessments of the species in the Atlantic Ocean. During the period 2006–2011, a total of 1132 fish were sampled by scientific observers on board Venezuelan and Brazilian longline vessels and from artisanal fisheries based out of Cumaná, Puerto La Cruz and Playa Verde, Venezuela and Cabo Frio, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The ovaries of 543 females were classified into five ovarian development phases based on microscopic analysis of the most advanced group of oocytes. Generalized additive models were applied to the gonadal index and sex ratio data in order to assess spatio-temporal trends of the reproductive activity and identify the spawning areas. Space–time effect was a significant factor contributing to changes in sex ratio and reproductive activity. Spawning activity was observed in two distinct areas. On the south-east Brazilian coast spawning peaked during December–February, while in the south-eastern Caribbean Sea spawning occurred between March and September, with its peak in March and April. Using a Bayesian approach, size at 50% maturity was estimated to be 146.12 cm (credibility interval of 95%, 138.45–152.09 cm). Batch fecundity ranged from 436,800 to 2,492,500 hydrated oocytes per female.

We analyzed sequences of mitochondrial and nuclear genes, geographic distributions, as well as photographs of specimens deposited at museum collections. Phylogenetic analyses identified three major lineages formed by populations from: Venezuela and Colombia (M. c. regulus), Ecuador and northern Peru (M. elata, M. castaneiceps, M. orientalis, M. c. chapmani), and central Peru and Bolivia (M. c. coronata). We found further population structure within M. c. regulus and M. c. coronata, and population structure and complexity of plumage variation within the Ecuador-northern Peru lineage. Time-calibrated trees estimated that most intraspecific variation originated during the Pleistocene; however, this pattern may not be attributed to an increase in diversification rate during that period. We discuss these results in the context of the importance of geographic-ecological barriers in promoting lineage diversification along the Andes and put forward a preliminary taxonomic proposal for major lineages identified in this study. © 2018 Prieto-Torres et al.

We fit for each spaceresolved element (pixel) an independent model where the SFH is averaged in 137 age bins, each one 100 Myr wide. We used the Bayesian Successive Priors (BSP) algorithm to mitigate the bias in the present-day spatial mass distribution. We test BSP with different prior probability distribution functions (PDFs); this exercise suggests that the best prior PDF is the one concordant with the spatial distribution of the stellar mass as inferred from the near-infrared images. We also demonstrate that varying the implicit prior PDF of the SFH in SSAG does not affect the results. By summing the contributions to the global star formation rate of each pixel, at each age bin, we have assembled the resolved SFH of the whole galaxy. According to these results, the star formation rate of M51a was exponentially increasing for the first 10 Gyr after the big bang, and then turned into an exponentially decreasing function until the present day. Superimposed, we find a main burst of star formation at t ≈ 11.9 Gyr after the big bang. © 2017 The Author(s).","In this paper, we analyze the effect on posterior parameter distributions of four possible alternative prior distributions, namely Normal-Inverse Gamma, Normal-Scaled Beta two, Student’s t-Inverse Gamma and Student’s t-Scaled Beta two. We show the effects of these prior distributions when there is apparently conflict between the sample information and the elicited hyperparameters. In particular, we show that there is not systematic differences of posterior parameter distributions associated with these four priors using data of piped water demand in a linear model with autoregressive errors. To test the hypothesis that this result is due to using a moderate sample size and a relatively high level of expert’s uncertainty, we perform some simulation exercises assuming smaller sample sizes and lower expert’s uncertainty. We obtain the general same pattern, although Student’s t models are slightly less affected by prior information when there is a high level of expert’s certainty, and Scaled Beta two models exhibit a higher level of posterior dispersion of the variance parameter. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2018.","Introduction. Currently, there are many fluctuations in the global economic environment and the demand and supply of assets or products act as a force that determines the prices according to which they are bought and sold, but sometimes, the price reflected in an action does not it reflects the price of generating value over time.

The main goal of the autonomic communication system is to adapt the communications platform to the characteristics of the context, in order to improve its performance. The ontology provides the knowledge about the performance factors and their relationships in the communication networks, to configure the structure of the Bayesian network. The Bayesian network is the stochastic reasoning mechanism used by the decision-making system. We present several tests on the NS2 simulator.

Bayesian clustering and genetic distance-based methods were used based on nine microsatellite loci in 377 individuals of three main putative species of the complex. The resulting genetic clusters were assessed for ecological niche divergence and areolar morphology, particularly spination patterns. We based our species boundaries on concordance between genetic, ecological, and morphological data, and were able to resolve four species, three of them corresponding to S. pruinosus from central Mexico, S. laevigatus from southern Mexico, and S. griseus from northern South America. A fourth species, previously considered to be S. griseus and commonly misidentified as S. pruinosus in northern Mexico showed significant genetic, ecological, and morphological differentiation suggesting that it should be considered a new species, S. huastecorum, which we describe here. We show that population genetic analyses, ecological niche modeling, and morphological studies are complementary approaches for delimiting species in taxonomically challenging plant groups such as the SGSC. © 2018 Alvarado-Sizzo et al.

Using a selection of physically motivated star formation histories, we set up a control sample of mock galaxy spectra representing observations of the local Universe in high-resolution spectroscopy, and in 56 narrow-band and 5 broad-band photometry. We fit the SEDs at these spectral resolutions and compute their corresponding stellar mass, the mass- and luminosity weighted age and metallicity, and the dust extinction. We study the biases, correlations and degeneracies affecting the retrieved parameters and explore the role of the spectral resolution and the SNR in regulating these degeneracies. We find that narrow-band photometry and spectroscopy yield similar trends in the physical properties derived, the former being considerably more precise. Using a galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we compare more realistically the results obtained from high-resolution and narrow-band SEDs (synthesized from the same SDSS spectra) following the same spectral fitting procedures. We use results from the literature as a benchmark to our spectroscopic estimates and showthat the prior probability distribution functions, commonly adopted in parametric methods, may introduce biases not accounted for in a Bayesian framework. We conclude that narrow-band photometry yields the same trend in the age-metallicity relation in the literature, provided it is affected by the same biases as spectroscopy, albeit the precision achieved with the latter is generally twice as large as with the narrow-band, at SNR values typical of the different kinds of data. © 2017 The Authors.","In this paper, the existence of a genotype x environment interaction for the average daily weight in GIFT Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in different regions in the state of Paraná (Brazil) was analyzed. The heritability results were high in the uni-characteristic analysis: 0.71, 0.72 and 0.67 for the cities of Palotina (PL), Floriano (FL) and Diamond North (DN), respectively. Genetic correlations estimated in bivariate analyzes were weak with values between 0.12 for PL-FL, 0.06 for PL and 0.23 for DN-FL-DN. The Spearman correlation values were low, which indicated a change in ranking in the selection of animals in different environments in the study. There was heterogeneity in the phenotypic variance among the three regions and heterogeneity in the residual variance between PL and DN. The direct genetic gain was greater for the region with a DN value gain of 198.24 g/generation, followed by FL (98.73 g/generation) and finally PL (98.73 g/generation). The indirect genetic gains were lower than 0.37 and greater than 0.02 g/generation.

The method relies purely on statistical analysis of observations and Monte-Carlo simulations to define stellar overdensities in the data. It decontaminates the cluster color-magnitude diagrams and, using a revised version of the Bayesian isochrone fitting code of Ramírez-Siordia et al., estimates the ages of the clusters. Comparisons of our estimates with those from other surveys show the superiority of our method to extract and measure the ages of star clusters, even in the most crowded fields. An application of our method is shown for the high-resolution, multiband imaging of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We detect 4850 clusters in the 7 deg2 we surveyed, 3451 of which have not been reported before. Our findings suggest multiple epochs of star cluster formation, with the most probable occurring ∼310 Myr ago. Several of these events are consistent with the epochs of the interactions among the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, and the Galaxy, as predicted by N-body numerical simulations. Finally, the spatially resolved star cluster formation history may suggest an inside-out cluster formation scenario throughout the LMC, for the past 1 Gyr. © 2017. The American Astronomical Society.

However, when the data is spatially incomplete most popular spatio-temporal methods of analysis cannot be applied directly. In this paper, we develop a two step methodology to model the spatio-temporal dependence of malaria incidence on local rainfall, temperature, and humidity as well as the regional sea surface temperatures (SST) in the northern coast of Venezuela. First, we fit an autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) to the weekly data, and then, we adjust a linear separable spacial vectorial autoregressive model (VAR) to the residuals of the ARDL. Finally, the model parameters are tuned using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure derived from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Our results show that the best model to account for the variations of malaria incidence from 2001 to 2008 in 10 endemic Municipalities in North-Eastern Venezuela is a logit model that included the accumulated local precipitation in combination with the local maximum temperature of the preceding month as positive regressors. Additionally, we show that although malaria dynamics is highly heterogeneous in space, a detailed analysis of the estimated spatial parameters in our model yield important insights regarding the joint behavior of the disease incidence across the different counties in our study. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Mikania (Eupatorieae, Asteraceae), with a pantropical distribution, has a highly defined and constant set of floral characters leading to its treatment as the sole representative of subtribe Mikaniinae. Several infrageneric classifications have been proposed for the genus, the last carried out in Brazil, where c. 204 species, mostly distributed in the Atlantic Forest domain, have been described. Studies of Mikania are scarce and, when available, the focus is only on species description. Reports on phylogenetic analysis of the genus are lacking. Here we used AFLP markers, nuclear (ITS and ETS) and plastid (rps16 intron) sequences to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of a group of species representing the taxonomic sections proposed for Brazilian Mikania spp. Analysis based on Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood showed no support for the proposed infrageneric classification based on morphological characters. Nonetheless, molecular data revealed the existence of two evolutionary lineages for the genus. Mikania micrantha was shown to be non-monophyletic. Divergence time estimation suggested the emergence of two main evolutionary lineages c. 6.0 My, during the Miocene. However, the processes of species diversification may have intensified due to climate change during the Pleistocene. © 2017 The Linnean Society of London.","Biodiversity studies are more efficient when large numbers of breeds belonging to several countries are involved, as they allow for an in-depth analysis of the within- and between-breed components of genetic diversity. A set of 21 microsatellites was used to investigate the genetic composition of 24 Creole goat breeds (910 animals) from 10 countries to estimate levels of genetic variability, infer population structure and understand genetic relationships among populations across the American continent. Three commercial transboundary breeds were included in the analyses to investigate admixture with Creole goats. Overall, the genetic diversity of Creole populations (mean number of alleles = 5.82 ± 1.14, observed heterozygosity = 0.585 ± 0.074) was moderate and slightly lower than what was detected in other studies with breeds from other regions. The Bayesian clustering analysis without prior information on source populations identified 22 breed clusters. Three groups comprised more than one population, namely from Brazil (Azul and Graúna; Moxotó and Repartida) and Argentina (Long and shorthair Chilluda, Pampeana Colorada and Angora-type goat). Substructure was found in Criolla Paraguaya. When prior information on sample origin was considered, 92% of the individuals were assigned to the source population (threshold q ≥ 0.700). Creole breeds are well-differentiated entities (mean coefficient of genetic differentiation = 0.111 ± 0.048, with the exception of isolated island populations). Dilution from admixture with commercial transboundary breeds appears to be negligible. Significant levels of inbreeding were detected (inbreeding coefficient > 0 in most Creole goat populations, P < 0.05). Our results provide a broad perspective on the extant genetic diversity of Creole goats, however further studies are needed to understand whether the observed geographical patterns of population structure may reflect the mode of goat colonization in the Americas. © 2017 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics","Online shopping has increasingly replaced traditional retail shopping, as a large number of consumers have adopted it on a global scale. However, while it is well established in developed countries, e-commerce is still at an early stage in emerging markets, hence there is a need to unveil which factors contributes to its adoption. The main objective of this study is to integrate the theory of planned behavior, the theory of reasoned action, and the technology acceptance model using a Bayesian approach to determine the key predictors of online purchase intention among internet users in Colombia. The results demonstrate the pertinence of the theory of reasoned action and technology acceptance model, models to explain online purchase intention, confirming that the intention to purchase online is mostly determined by the attitudes to e-commerce which, in turn, are explained by perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and the subjective norm related to online shopping. © 2017 Universidad de Talca-Chile.","Successful response inhibition depends upon the delay between the cues that signal a response and its subsequent inhibition. Previous studies report activity in the right presupplementary motor area (rPreSMA), right anterior insula (rAI), and the right striatum (rSTR) when subjects attempt to inhibit responses. Although these regions are anatomically connected, how they interact during successful and unsuccessful inhibitions has not been studied. In this work, we used a temporal prediction task, functional MRI, and dynamic causal modeling to solve this question. We found selective direct activation of both the rPreSMA and the rAI during successful and unsuccessful inhibitions which also were associated with opposite modulatory effects on insular-striatal and presupplementary-motor striatal descending connections. Moreover, inputs to the rPreSMA during successful inhibitions were propagated to the rAI whereas inputs to the rAI during unsuccessful inhibitions were propagated to the rPreSMA. We interpret that the direct perturbation in the rPreSMA and the modulation of the rPreSMA → rSTR connections would facilitate response inhibition whereas weak insular activity would cause response inhibition to fail despite the existence of strong rAI → rSTR modulations. We discuss that descending connections could be nonlinearly modulated via activity of either the right inferior frontal gyrus or the left anterior cingulate cortex. From a predictive coding perspective, rAI activity during successful and unsuccessful inhibition would signal interoceptive information when subjects unexpectedly need to change behaviors. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","The Mellin transform technique is applied for solving the Black-Scholes equation with time-dependent parameters and discontinuous payoff. We show that the option pricing is equivalent to recovering a probability density function on the positive real axis based on its moments, which are integer or fractional Mellin transform values. Then the Mellin transform can be effectively inverted from a collection of appropriately chosen fractional (i.e. non-integer) moments by means of the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) method. An accurate option pricing is guaranteed by previous theoretical results about MaxEnt distributions constrained by fractional moments. We prove that typical drawbacks of other numerical techniques, such as Finite Difference schemes, are bypassed exploiting the Mellin transform properties. An example involving discretely monitored barrier options is illustrated and the accuracy, efficiency and time consuming are discussed. © 2016","Stellar masses of galaxies are frequently obtained by fitting stellar population synthesis models to galaxy photometry or spectra. The state of the art method resolves spatial structures within a galaxy to assess the total stellar mass content. In comparison to unresolved studies, resolved methods yield, on average, higher fractions of stellar mass for galaxies. In this work we improve the current method in order to mitigate a bias related to the resolved spatial distribution derived for the mass. The bias consists in an apparent filamentary mass distribution and a spatial coincidence between mass structures and dust lanes near spiral arms. The improved method is based on iterative Bayesian marginalization, through a new algorithm we have named Bayesian Successive Priors (BSP). We have applied BSP to M51 and to a pilot sample of 90 spiral galaxies from the Ohio State University Bright Spiral Galaxy Survey. By quantitatively comparing both methods, we find that the average fraction of stellar mass missed by unresolved studies is only half what previously thought. In contrast with the previous method, the output BSP mass maps bear a better resemblance to near-infrared images. © 2017. The American Astronomical Society.

Therefore, some aspects of its distribution, habitat requirements, and abundance are mostly unknown; which makes a proper determination of its conservation status difficult. Considering that new techniques known as species distribution models (SDMs) allow us to estimate the suitable areas and the most important variables for the distribution of a species, we compiled water opossum occurrences and modeled its potential distribution on a continental scale. We performed a SDM for the water opossum using MaxEnt and assessed the extent of habitat loss (km2) and the importance of Protected Areas (PAs). We compared the suitability values within and outside PAs using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to evaluate the efficiency of PAs. The results obtained were compared with the IUCN historical water opossum's map. Additionally, we identified gaps in the potential distribution where for future surveys should be focused. We obtained models that describe the distribution of this species based on 292 occurrences with new information for 16 countries. Deforestation reduced the area of suitable habitat by ∼40 % and only ∼18 % corresponds to natural forest within PAs. Areas inside PAs showed higher suitability values (0.351 ± 0.276; P < 0.001) than areas outside them. We identified gaps within the distribution that need attention during future surveys such as the frontier between Venezuela and Guyana, the Amazonian region, and central-eastern Brazil. Our results showed areas absent in the IUCN's distribution map, indicating that it needs to be updated. Thus, we proposed a new tentative extent of the water opossum distribution information here obtained. We demonstrated that PAs included areas with high habitat suitability values for C. minimus, which could protect the water opossum in the medium and long-term. Modifications to the physicochemical characteristics of the habitat due to forest loss and fragmentation can considerably affect water opossum populations and reduce local diversity. Thus, the preservation of river ecosystems and surrounding areas represents a necessary step for the conservation of C. minimus. © 2017 Asociación Mexicana de Mastozoología, www.mastozoologiamexicana.org.","We put forward the Scaled Beta2 (SBeta2) as a flexible and tractable family for modeling scales in both hierarchical and non-hierarchical settings. Various sensible alternatives to the overuse of vague Inverted Gamma priors have been proposed, mainly for hierarchical models. Several of these alternatives are particular cases of the SBeta2 or can be well approximated by it. This family of distributions can be obtained in closed form as a Gamma scale mixture of Gamma distributions, as the Student distribution can be obtained as a Gamma scale mixture of Normal variables. Members of the SBeta2 family arise as intrinsic priors and as divergence based priors in diverse situations, hierarchical and non-hierarchical. The SBeta2 family unifies and generalizes different proposals in the Bayesian literature, and has numerous theoretical and practical advantages: It is flexible, its members can be lighter, as heavy or heavier tailed as the half-Cauchy, and different behaviors at the origin can be modeled. It has the reciprocality property, i.e if the variance parameter is in the family the precision also is. It is easy to simulate from, and can be embedded in a Gibbs sampling scheme. Short of not being conjugate, it is also amazingly tractable: When coupled with a conditional Cauchy prior for locations, the marginal prior for locations can be found explicitly as proportional to known transcendental functions, and for integer values of the hyperparameters an analytical closed form exists. Furthermore, for specific choices of the hyperparameters, the marginal is found to be an explicit \"horseshoe prior\", which are known to have excellent theoretical and practical properties. To our knowledge this is the first closed form horseshoe prior obtained. We also show that for certain values of the hyperparameters the mixture of a Normal and a Scaled Beta2 distribution also gives a closed form marginal. Examples include robust normal and binomial hierarchical modeling and metaanalysis, with real and simulated data. © 2017.

These signatures have been identified from high throughput sequencing data generated from cancer genomes by using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) techniques. Current methods based on optimization techniques are strongly sensitive to initial conditions due to high dimensionality and nonconvexity of the NMF paradigm. In this context, an important question consists in the determination of the actual number of signatures that best represent the data. The extraction of mutational signatures from high-throughput data still remains a daunting task. Results: Here we present a new method for the statistical estimation of mutational signatures based on an empirical Bayesian treatment of the NMF model. While requiring minimal intervention from the user, our method addresses the determination of the number of signatures directly as a model selection problem. In addition, we introduce two new concepts of significant clinical relevance for evaluating the mutational profile. The advantages brought by our approach are shown by the analysis of real and synthetic data. The later is used to compare our approach against two alternative methods mostly used in the literature and with the same NMF parametrization as the one considered here. Our approach is robust to initial conditions and more accurate than competing alternatives. It also estimates the correct number of signatures even when other methods fail. Results on real data agree well with current knowledge. © The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press.

Participants produce time intervals during the task, and the researcher explores how task performance affects interval production - where time estimation error is the dependent variable of interest. The perspective of predictive behavior regards time estimation error as a temporal prediction error (PE), an independent variable that controls cognition, behavior, and learning. Based on this perspective, we investigated whether temporal PEs affect short-term memory scanning. Participants performed temporal predictions while they maintained information in memory. Model inference revealed that PEs affected memory scanning response time independently of the memory-set size effect. We discuss the results within the context of formal and mechanistic models of short-term memory scanning and predictive coding, a Bayes-based theory of brain function. We state the hypothesis that our finding could be associated with weak frontostriatal connections and weak striatal activity. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.","This paper presents a spatiotemporal dynamic model which allows Bayesian inference of precipitation states in some Venezuelan meteorological stations. One of the limitations that are reported in digital databases is the reliability of the records and the lack of information for certain days, weeks, or months. To complete the missing data, the Gibbs algorithm, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure, was used. A feature of precipitation series is that their distribution contains discrete and continuous components implying complicated dynamics. A model is proposed based on a discrete representation of a stochastic integro-difference equation. Given the difficulty of obtaining explicit analytical expressions for the predictive posterior distribution, approximations were obtained using a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm called the parallelized ensemble Kalman filter. The proposed method permits the completion of the missing data in the series where required and secondly allows the splitting of a large database into smaller ones for separate evaluation and eventual combination of the individual results. The objective is to reduce the dimension and computational cost in order to obtain models that are able to describe the reality in real time. It was shown that the obtained models are able to predict spatially and temporally the states of rainfall for at least three to four days quickly, efficiently and accurately. Three methods of statistical validation were used to evaluate the performance of the model and showed no significant discrepancies. Speedup and efficiency factors were calculated to compare the speed of calculation using the parallelized ensemble Kalman filter algorithm with the speed of the sequential version. The improvement in speed for four pthread executions was greatest. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2016.","In modern decision making systems, it is necessary to develop ways to optimize the decisions. To achieve this objective, new paradigms are necessary, as those linked to autonomic paradigm, which establishes, among other things, the self-configuration of the systems in order to improve their performances. On this basis, this paper proposes a system of autonomous decision, based on Bayesian networks and ontologies, to optimize and adapt a system to the characteristics of the context. The ontology provides the knowledge about the context to study, to configure the structure of the Bayesian network, while this latter is the stochastic reasoning mechanism used by the decision-making system. To verify the operation of our approach, it is used in an autonomic communication system. In the tests realized we could observe an improvement in the system performance. © 2016 IEEE.","Large earthquakes have semi-periodic behavior as a result of critically self-organized processes of stress accumulation and release in seismogenic regions. Hence, large earthquakes in a given region constitute semi-periodic sequences with recurrence times varying slightly from periodicity. In previous papers, it has been shown that it is possible to identify these sequences through Fourier analysis of the occurrence time series of large earthquakes from a given region, by realizing that not all earthquakes in the region need belong to the same sequence, since there can be more than one process of stress accumulation and release in the region. Sequence identification can be used to forecast earthquake occurrence with well determined confidence bounds. This paper presents improvements on the above mentioned sequence identification and forecasting method: the influence of earthquake size on the spectral analysis, and its importance in semi-periodic events identification are considered, which means that earthquake occurrence times are treated as a labeled point process; a revised estimation of non-randomness probability is used; a better estimation of appropriate upper limit uncertainties to use in forecasts is introduced; and the use of Bayesian analysis to evaluate the posterior forecast performance is applied. This improved method was successfully tested on synthetic data and subsequently applied to real data from some specific regions. As an example of application, we show the analysis of data from the northeastern Japan Arc region, in which one semi-periodic sequence of four earthquakes with M ≥ 8.0, having high non-randomness probability was identified. We compare the results of this analysis with those of the unlabeled point process analysis. © 2016, Springer International Publishing.","Action update, substituting a prepotent behavior with a new action, allows the organism to counteract surprising environmental demands. However, action update fails when the organism is uncertain about when to release the substituting behavior, when it faces temporal uncertainty. Predictive coding states that accurate perception demands minimization of precise prediction errors. Activity of the right anterior insula (rAI) is associated with temporal uncertainty. Therefore, we hypothesize that temporal uncertainty during action update would cause the AI to decrease the sensitivity to ascending prediction errors. Moreover, action update requires response inhibition which recruits the frontostriatal indirect pathway associated with motor control. Therefore, we also hypothesize that temporal estimation errors modulate frontostriatal connections. To test these hypotheses, we collected fMRI data when participants performed an action-update paradigm within the context of temporal estimation. We fit dynamic causal models to the imaging data. Competing models comprised the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), right supramarginal gyrus (rSMG), rAI, right presupplementary motor area (rPreSMA), and the right striatum (rSTR). The winning model showed that temporal uncertainty drove activity into the rAI and decreased insular sensitivity to ascending prediction errors, as shown by weak connectivity strength of rSMG→rAI connections. Moreover, temporal estimation errors weakened rPreSMA→rSTR connections and also modulated rAI→rSTR connections, causing the disruption of action update. Results provide information about the neurophysiological implementation of the so-called horserace model of action control. We suggest that, contrary to what might be believed, unsuccessful action update could be a homeostatic process that represents a Bayes optimal encoding of uncertainty. © 2016 Limongi, Pérez, Modroño and González-Mora.","This study presents the first insights into the genetic diversity and structure of the American donkey metapopulation. The primary objectives were to detect the main structural features underlying variability among American donkey populations, identify boundaries between differentiated gene pools, and draw the main colonization pathways since the introduction of donkeys into America in the 15th century. A panel of 14 microsatellite markers was applied for genotyping 350 American donkeys from 13 countries. The genetic structure of this metapopulation was analysed using descriptive statistics and Bayesian model-based methods. These populations were then compared to a database containing information on 476 individuals from 11 European breeds to identify the most likely ancestral donor populations. Results showed the presence of two distinct genetic pools, with confluence of the two in Colombia. The southern pool showed a unique genetic signature subsequent to an older founder event, but lacked any significant influence of modern gene flow from Europe. The northern pool, conversely, may have retained more ancestral polymorphisms and/or have experienced modern gene flow from Spanish breeds. The Andalusian and, to a lesser extent, the Catalan breeds have left a more pronounced footprint in some of the American donkey populations analysed. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Previous studies have shown that a 64-kDa antigen (p64) that was purified from the Venezuelan TeAp-N/D1 isolate of Trypanosoma (Trypanozoon) equiperdum corresponds to the soluble form of its predominant variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), and exhibited cross-reactivity with Trypanosoma (Duttonella) vivax. The course of experimental acute infections of bovines with T. vivax were followed by measuring whole anti-p64 antibodies and specific anti-p64 IgG and IgM antibodies in animal sera by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The value of p64 to diagnose bovine trypanosomosis was also examined using 350 sera from healthy and T. vivax-infected cows living in a trypanosomosis-endemic and enzootic stable area, and 48 sera obtained during a trypanosomosis outbreak. Serological assays showed that ~70-80% of the infected sera contained anti-p64 antibodies, based on the comparative immunodetection of the T. equiperdum clarified antigenic fraction used as a reference test. In the absence of a gold standard, Bayesian analysis for multiple testing estimated a sensitivity and specificity of 71.6% and 98.8%, respectively, for the indirect ELISA using p64 as antigen. An apparent prevalence of 37.7% for bovine trypanosomosis infection was also estimated with a Bayesian approach when the p64 ELISA test was used. Employing blood from acute infected cows, the indirect ELISA response against p64 was contrasted with the microhematocrit centrifuge method and analyses by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers targeting the inter-specific length variation of the internal transcribed spacer 1 region of the 18S ribosomal gene. The efficiency of p64 for the detection of anti-trypanosome antibodies in acute infected bovines was also corroborated serologically by comparing its response to that of the Indonesian Trypanosoma evansi Rode Trypanozoon antigen type (RoTat) 1.2 VSG, which possesses high specificity and sensitivity. As expected, PCR was the best method to detect parasites and diagnose bovine trypanosomosis; however, a substantial level of concordance (Cohen's κ = 0.667) was obtained when serological tests using p64 and RoTat 1.2 VSG were compared. Additionally, an agglutination assay was designed using p64 covalently coupled to carboxylate-modified latex microparticles, which was proven here to be suitable for a fast qualitative diagnosis of bovine trypanosomosis. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","We use Bayesian methods to infer an unobserved function that is convolved with a known kernel. Our method is based on the assumption that the function of interest is a Gaussian process and, assuming a particular correlation structure, the resulting convolution is also a Gaussian process. This fact is used to obtain inferences regarding the unobserved process, effectively providing a deconvolution method. We apply the methodology to the problem of estimating the parameters of an oil reservoir from well-test pressure data. Here, the unknown process describes the structure of the well. Applications to data from Mexican oil wells show very accurate results. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","We define a dynamic and self-adjusting mixture of Gaussian Graphical Models to cluster financial returns, and provide a new method for extraction of nonparametric estimates of dynamic alphas (excess return) and betas (to a choice set of explanatory factors) in a multivariate setting. This approach, as well as the outputs, has a dynamic, nonstationary and nonparametric form, which circumvents the problem of model risk and parametric assumptions that the Kalman filter and other widely used approaches rely on. The by-product of clusters, used for shrinkage and information borrowing, can be of use to determine relationships around specific events. This approach exhibits a smaller Root Mean Squared Error than traditionally used benchmarks in financial settings, which we illustrate through simulation. As an illustration, we use hedge fund index data, and find that our estimated alphas are, on average, 0.13% per month higher (1.6% per year) than alphas estimated through Ordinary Least Squares. The approach exhibits fast adaptation to abrupt changes in the parameters, as seen in our estimated alphas and betas, which exhibit high volatility, especially in periods which can be identified as times of stressful market events, a reflection of the dynamic positioning of hedge fund portfolio managers. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","To improve short-horizon exchange rate forecasts, we employ foreign exchange market risk factors as fundamentals, and Bayesian treed Gaussian process (BTGP) models to handle non-linear, time-varying relationships between these fundamentals and exchange rates. Forecasts from the BTGP model conditional on the carry and dollar factors dominate random walk forecasts on accuracy and economic criteria in the Meese-Rogoff setting. Superior market timing ability for large moves, more than directional accuracy, drives the BTGP’s success. We explain how, through a model averaging Monte Carlo scheme, the BTGP is able to simultaneously exploit smoothness and rough breaks in between-variable dynamics. Either feature in isolation is unable to consistently outperform benchmarks throughout the full span of time in our forecasting exercises. Trading strategies based on ex ante BTGP forecasts deliver the highest out-of-sample risk-adjusted returns for the median currency, as well as for both predictable, traded risk factors. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","The finite-element Gaussian belief propagation (FGaBP) method, introduced recently, provides a powerful alternative to the conventional finite-element method solvers to efficiently utilize high-performance computing platforms.

Here we build upon a recent molecular phylogeny of this subfamily to investigate the phylogenetic placement of Rugosus García, 2001, a genus comprising two species from the Guiana Shield region of Venezuela. We sequenced one mitochondrial and one nuclear gene fragment of Rugosus emarginatus García, as well as a specimen of Aglymbus leprieurii Aubé from Guyana in order to reassess the phylogenetic placement of the genus in the subfamily Copelatinae. Bayesian Inference analyses unambiguously indicate that Rugosus is nested within Aglymbus Sharp, 1880. As a result, Rugosus is synonymized with Aglymbus. Based on these results and on recent collecting data, the distribution of Aglymbus now includes Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. High-resolution images of the holotype specimens and labels of Aglymbus emarginatus (García), new combination and Aglymbus pubis (García), new combination are provided, as well as comments on the habitat of species in the \"A. leprieurii species-group\" of Aglymbus.","We test the predictions of spectral synthesis models based on seven different massive-star prescriptions against Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) observations of eight young massive clusters in two local galaxies, NGC 1566 and NGC 5253, chosen because predictions of all seven models are available at the published galactic metallicities. The high angular resolution, extensive cluster inventory, and full near-ultraviolet to near-infrared photometric coverage make the LEGUS data set excellent for this study. We account for both stellar and nebular emission in the models and try two different prescriptions for attenuation by dust. From Bayesian fits of model libraries to the observations, we find remarkably low dispersion in the median E(B - V) (~0.03 mag), stellar masses (~104M⊙), and ages (~1Myr) derived for individual clusters using different models, although maximum discrepancies in these quantities can reach 0.09 mag and factors of 2.8 and 2.5, respectively. This is for ranges in median properties of 0.05-0.54 mag, 1.8-10 × 104M⊙, and 1.6-40 Myr spanned by the clusters in our sample. In terms of best fit, the observations are slightly better reproduced by models with interacting binaries and least well reproduced by models with single rotating stars. Our study provides a first quantitative estimate of the accuracies and uncertainties of the most recent spectral synthesis models of young stellar populations, demonstrates the good progress of models in fitting high-quality observations, and highlights the needs for a larger cluster sample and more extensive tests of the model parameter space. © 2016 The Authors.

Press] and clearly exposed by DeGroot [Probability and Statistics (1975) Addison-Wesley], with the aim of developing an approach that is attractive to all schools of statistics, resulting in a procedure better suited to the needs of science. The essential idea is to base testing statistical hypotheses on minimizing a weighted sum of type I and type II error probabilities instead of the prevailing paradigm, which is fixing type I error probability and minimizing type II error probability. For simple vs simple hypotheses, the optimal criterion is to reject the null using the likelihood ratio as the evidence (ordering) statistic, with a fixed threshold value instead of a fixed tail probability. By defining expected type I and type II error probabilities, we generalize the weighting approach and find that the optimal region is defined by the evidence ratio, that is, a ratio of averaged likelihoods (with respect to a prior measure) and a fixed threshold. This approach yields an optimal theory in complete generality, which the classical theory of testing does not. This can be seen as a Bayesian/non-Bayesian compromise: using a weighted sum of type I and type II error probabilities is Frequentist, but basing the test criterion on a ratio of marginalized likelihoods is Bayesian. We give arguments to push the theory still further, so that the weighting measures (priors) of the likelihoods do not have to be proper and highly informative, but just “well calibrated.” That is, priors that give rise to the same evidence (marginal likelihoods) using minimal (smallest) training samples. The theory that emerges, similar to the theories based on objective Bayesian approaches, is a powerful response to criticisms of the prevailing approach of hypothesis testing. For criticisms see, for example, Ioannidis [PLoS Medicine 2 (2005) e124] and Siegfried [Science News 177 (2010) 26–29], among many others. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2016.","For a consumer products company, market knowledge can be decisive in their growth and increase their participation; mastery and control of inventories and the efficient management of customer service is fundamental to optimize planning and gain share in emerging economies.

In this work we show however that probabilistic beliefs can be maintained in factored form exactly and efficiently across a number of causally closed beams, when the state variables that appear in more than one beam obey a form of backward determinism. Since computing marginals from the factors is still computationally intractable in general, and variables appearing in several beams are not always backward-deterministic, the basic formulation is extended with two approximations: forms of belief propagation for computing marginals from factors, and sampling of non-backward-deterministic variables for making such variables backwarddeterministic given their sampled history. Unlike, Rao-Blackwellized particle-filtering, the sampling is not used for making inference tractable but for making the factorization sound. The resulting algorithm involves sampling and belief propagation or just one of them as determined by the structure of the model.","Assuming that co-distributed species are exposed to similar environmental conditions, ecological niche models (ENMs) of bird and plant species inhabiting tropical dry forests (TDFs) in Mexico were developed to evaluate future projections of their distribution for the years 2050 and 2070. We used ENM-based predictions and climatic data for two Global Climate Models, considering two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP4.5/RCP8.5). We also evaluated the effects of habitat loss and the importance of the Mexican system of protected areas (PAs) on the projected models for a more detailed prediction of TDFs and to identify hot spots that require conservation actions. We identified four major distributional areas: the main one located along the Pacific Coast (from Sonora to Chiapas, including the Cape and Bajío regions, and the Balsas river basin), and three isolated areas: the Yucatán peninsula, central Veracruz, and southern Tamaulipas. When considering the effect of habitat loss, a significant reduction (~61%) of the TDFs predicted area occurred, whereas climate-change models suggested (in comparison with the present distribution model) an increase in area of 3.0-10.0% and 3.0-9.0% for 2050 and 2070, respectively. In future scenarios, TDFs will occupy areas above its current average elevational distribution that are outside of its present geographical range. Our findings show that TDFs may persist in Mexican territory until the middle of the XXI century; however, the challenges about long-term conservation are partially addressed (only 7% unaffected within the Mexican network of PAs) with the current Mexican PAs network. Based on our ENM approach, we suggest that a combination of models of species inhabiting present TDFs and taking into account change scenarios represent an invaluable tool to create new PAs and ecological corridors, as a response to the increasing levels of habitat destruction and the effects of climate change on this ecosystem. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","The Neotropics harbor the world’s most diverse freshwater fish fauna, with many of these species supporting major commercial, subsistence, or sport fisheries. Knowledge of population genetic structure is available for very few Neotropical fishes, thereby restricting management. To address this need, we examined population genetic variation in mtDNA control region sequences and twelve microsatellite loci in the speckled or barred peacock bass, Cichla temensis. Moderate and statistically significant genetic divergence among localities indicates that migration is low in this species, implying that populations inhabiting tributaries or even smaller spatial units should constitute management units. Analysis of molecular variance of mtDNA sequences identified six areas with largely exclusive haplotype clades, and a seventh area of high admixture, but major drainage basins harbored non-monophyletic haplotype groups. On the other hand, molecular variation in the microsatellite data was best explained by drainage basin and, subsequently, by the seven areas. Populations in these seven areas could be considered evolutionarily significant units (ESUs), and, therefore, we tested hypotheses explaining the discordant signal of mtDNA and microsatellite data using approximate Bayesian computation. This analysis indicated that the divergence of mtDNA clades preceded the divergence of contemporary ESUs across basins, with subsequent lineage sorting among ESUs due to reduced gene flow. Available genetic and ecological information indicates that C. temensis populations of major tributary rivers should be managed as separate stocks that likely are adapted to local environmental conditions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Fetal heart rate monitoring plays an essential role in helping to decrease the perinatal mortality rate associated with abnormalities in the cardiovascular system of the fetus. In this sense, a new approach to detect fetal QRS (fQRS) complexes from abdominal maternal ECG signals is proposed in this paper. First, signals were segmented into contiguous frames of 250 ms duration and then labeled in four classes. Principal component analysis was applied on Haar-Wavelet transform for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, and interquartile ranges and sampling without replacement were employed to deal with outliers and imbalanced class problems, respectively. K-nearest neighborhood (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and Bayesian network (BN) were trained and tested on the ECG signals of four electrodes of the PhysioNet/CinC challenge 2013 dataset, using 10-fold stratified cross-validation. Results show that KNN and SVM got better average accuracies over BN, that reach to 89.59% and 89.19%, respectively. Although KNN yielded better results, SVM was less time-consuming in prediction. In addition, the fourth electrode signals are less noisy and contain more representative data that helps SVM reaches an accuracy about 80% for fQRS estimation. © 2015 IEEE.","Hydrocarbon reservoir characterization commonly combines seismic, petrophysical, and well-log information in a variety of procedures. As an inference problem, this combination can be formulated in a unified inverse framework, reducing the bias of nonlinear relationships among intermediate variables and providing a comprehensive calculation of uncertainties at final estimates of the medium parameters. In addition, the unified formulation leads to the joint estimation of reservoir and medium elastic properties as well as related parameters of interests. This problem is formulated from a set of continuous variables that commonly characterizes the reservoir (total porosity, shale volume fraction, and water saturation), which can be related to the medium mechanical properties with a petrophysical model calibrated to the specific setting of the reservoir and target stratum. The joint model property configuration is related to the observed seismic data via Zoeppritz incidence-angle-dependent reflectivity and convolution with a source wavelet for each CDP gather. Data and calibrated information are combined in a posterior probability density of the model parameters that is evaluated with a sampling approach, using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm. From a large number of realizations, one can calculate expected values and full marginal probability distributions for reservoir properties and elastic properties. The method is illustrated with the estimation of reservoir parameters at a gas reservoir presenting a Class 2 AVA response, with focus on the estimation of water saturation. The calculated saturation probability distributions show coherent results with the known saturation at various well locations. © 2015, Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

Although the species has been registered in several localities, its geographic distribution remains unclear, and the effects of climate change and current land uses on this species are largely unknown. We modeled the ecological niche of T. pinchaque using MaxEnt, in order to assess its potential adaptation to present and future climate change scenarios. We evaluated the effects of habitat loss due by current land use, the ecosystem availability and importance of Ecuadorian System of Protected Areas into the models. The model of environmental suitability estimated an extent of occurrence for species of 21,729 km2 in all of Ecuador, mainly occurring along the corridor of the eastern Ecuadorian Andes. A total of 10 Andean ecosystems encompassed ~98% of the area defined by the model, with herbaceous paramo, northeastern Andean montane evergreen forest and northeastern Andes upper montane evergreen forest being the most representative. When considering the effect of habitat loss, a significant reduction in model area (~17%) occurred, and the effect of climate change represented a net reduction up to 37.86%. However, the synergistic effect of both climate change and habitat loss, given current land use practices, could represent a greater risk in the short-term, leading to a net reduction of 19.90 to 44.65% in T. pinchaque's potential distribution. Even under such a scenarios, several Protected Areas harbor a portion (~36 to 48%) of the potential distribution defined by the models. However, the central and southern populations are highly threatened by habitat loss and climate change. Based on these results and due to the restricted home range of T. pinchaque, its preference for upland forests and paramos, and its small estimated population size in the Andes, we suggest to maintaining its current status as Critically Endangered in Ecuador. © 2015 Ortega-Andrade et al.","This paper introduces a robust method based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to detect the presence of Fetal QRS (fQRS) complexes in electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provided by the PhysioNet/CinC challenge 2013. ECG signals are first segmented into contiguous frames of 250 ms duration and then labeled in six classes. Fetal segments are tagged according to the position of fQRS complex within each one. Next, segment features extraction and dimensionality reduction are obtained by applying principal component analysis on Haar-wavelet transform. After that, two sub-datasets are generated to separate representative segments from atypical ones. Imbalanced class problem is dealt by applying sampling without replacement on each sub-dataset. Finally, two SVMs are trained and cross-validated using the two balanced sub-datasets separately. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves high performance rates in fetal heartbeats detection that reach up to 90.95% of accuracy, 92.16% of sensitivity, 88.51% of specificity, 94.13% of positive predictive value and 84.96% of negative predictive value. A comparative study is also carried out to show the performance of other two machine learning algorithms for fQRS complex estimation, which are K-nearest neighborhood and Bayesian network. © 2015 SPIE.","Phylogeographic patterns and population genetic structure of Yersinia ruckeri, the pathological agent of enteric redmouth disease (ERM) in salmonids, were investigated on the basis of concatenated multiloci sequences from isolates of different phenotypes obtained between 1965 and 2009 from diverse areas and hosts. Sequence analyses revealed genetic differentiation among subpopulations with the largest genetic distance occurring between subpopulations of Europe and Canada and/or South America. Bayesian analysis indicated the presence of three ancestral population clusters. Mismatch distribution displayed signatures characteristic of changes in size due to demographic and spatial expansions in the overall Y. ruckeri population, and also in the geographically separate subpopulations. Furthermore, a weak signal of isolation by distance was determined. A significant positive correlation between genetic and geographical distances was observed. These results revealed that the population of Y. ruckeri has undergone both ancient and recent population changes that were probably induced by biogeography forces in the past and, much more recently, by adaptive processes forced by aquaculture expansion. These findings have important implications for future studies on Y. ruckeri population dynamics, on the potential role of genetic structure to explain variations in ERM transmission, and on the effect of past evolutionary events on current estimations of gene flow. © 2015 Bastardo, Ravelo and Romalde.","We build on the derivative pricing calibration literature, and propose a more general calibration model for implied risk neutral densities. Our model allows for the joint calibration of a set of densities at different maturities and dates through a Bayesian dynamic Beta Markov Random Field. Our approach allows for possible time dependence between densities with the same maturity, and for dependence across maturities at the same point in time. This approach to the risk neutral density calibration problem encompasses model flexibility, parameter parsimony, and, more importantly, information pooling across densities. This proposed methodology can be naturally extended to other areas where multidimensional calibration is needed. © 2015 International Society for Bayesian Analysis.","In this paper, we propose a new online apnea–bradycardia detection scheme that takes into account not only the instantaneous values of time series, but also their temporal evolution. The detector is based on a set of hidden semi-Markov models, representing the temporal evolution of beat-to-beat interval (RR interval) time series. A preprocessing step, including quantization and delayed version of the observation vector, is also proposed to maximize detection performance. This approach is quantitatively evaluated through simulated and real signals, the latter being acquired in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Compared to two conventional detectors used in NICU, our best detector shows an improvement on average of around 15 % in sensitivity and 7 % in specificity. Furthermore, a reduced detection delay of approximately 2 s is also observed with respect to conventional detectors. © 2014, International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.","The phylogeny of the aquatic beetle family Hydroscaphidae is inferred from one mitochondrial (COI) and five nuclear (18S, 28S, wingless, arginine kinase and CAD) genes. Bayesian, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analyses were conducted on a combined dataset that included representatives from all three described hydroscaphid genera, three new species of the family of uncertain placement, and representatives from the myxophagan families Sphaeriusidae, Torridincolidae and Lepiceridae. All analyses strongly supported a set of nearly identical trees in which (i) the monophyly of Hydroscaphidae and all its constituent genera is affirmed, (ii) the nearly cosmopolitan genus Hydroscapha is sister to the remaining and exclusively Neotropical genera, and (iii) the new, morphologically aberrant taxa from the Guiana Shield form a monophylum separate from any described genus. Here, we review each genus of the family including the description of Confossa Short, Joly, García & Maddison gen.n. to accommodate three new species: C.sculptura sp.n., C. falcata sp.n. and C.minima sp.n. The new genus possesses a remarkable perforated abdominal surface that we hypothesize serves as a respiratory plastron. We also present a key to the genera and a catalogue of species of the family. © 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.","The tepuis of South America are massive flattop mountains with cliffs up to 1000. m and summits up to 3100. m. Tepuis hold enormous endemicity levels, but little is known about the origins of the endemic flora and fauna. Recently diverged lineages offer the possibility of understanding the origins of summit endemicity by examining population dynamics and dispersal. We examine species delimitation, clade relationships, and demographic patterns of three recently diverged lineages of Tepuihyla, an endemic treefrog clade. These three lineages represent two currently recognized species, T. edelcae and T. rodriguezi. Given the low divergences in both nuclear and mitochondrial genes among lineages, we find unexpectedly high numbers of unique nuclear haplotypes and moderate levels of lineage sorting. We also find support from multiple analyses for a cryptic, undescribed summit species within T. edelcae. We suggest that the genetic and distribution patterns of the four most recently diverged Tepuihyla lineages support a concurrent speciation event during the Pliocene, and suggest a biogeographic hypothesis in which a widespread climatic change made mid- and low-elevation habitat unsuitable for the common ancestor within the timeframe of their divergence. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","The objective of this work was to estimate the (co)variance and the genetic parameters for weight and average daily gain from two national generations of the GIFT strain of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). We evaluated 3918 fish from two generations of the breeding program from the Universidade Estadual de Maringá, Northwestern Paraná. Univariate and bivariate analysis were carried out using Bayesian inference. The estimates of heritability using one-trait models for weight was 0.15, average daily gain was 0.19, fish length was 0.23, fish width was 0.19, standard length was 0.17, fish height was 0.15, and the head length was 0.17. The genetic and phenotypic correlations were above 0.68 and 0.95, respectively. The values of Spearman and Pearson correlations for breeding values of the morphometric traits in relation to average daily gain ranged from 0.58 to 0.98 and from 0.63 to 0.99, respectively. In the second generation (G2), the genetic gain was 2.6%, the effective size of the population was 94, and the inbreeding coefficient was 0.005. In the next generation (G3), these values were 8.1%, 124 and 0.004, respectively. The genetic gains over the generations gradually increased from one generation to another, indicating that the criterion, average daily gain, chosen for feature selection was efficient.","Lantana camara, a native plant from tropical America, is considered one of the most harmful invasive species worldwide. Several studies have identified potentially invasible areas under scenarios of global change, on the assumption that niche is conserved during the invasion process. Recent studies, however, suggest that many invasive plants do not conserve their niches. Using Principal Components Analyses (PCA), we tested the hypothesis of niche conservatism for L. camara by comparing its native niche in South America with its expressed niche in Africa, Australia and India. Using MaxEnt, the estimated niche for the native region was projected onto each invaded region to generate potential distributions there. Our results demonstrate that while L. camara occupied subsets of its original native niche in Africa and Australia, in India its niche shifted significantly. There, 34% of the occurrences were detected in warmer habitats nonexistent in its native range. The estimated niche for India was also projected onto Africa and Australia to identify other vulnerable areas predicted from the observed niche shift detected in India. As a result, new potentially invasible areas were identified in central Africa and southern Australia. Our findings do not support the hypothesis of niche conservatism for the invasion of L. camara . The mechanisms that allow this species to expand its niche need to be investigated in order to improve our capacity to predict long-term geographic changes in the face of global climatic changes. ©2014 Goncalves et al.","The fine-leaved Loliinae is one of the temperate grass lineages that is richest in number of evolutionary switches from perennial to annual life-cycle, and also shows one of the most complex reticulate patterns involving distinct diploid and allopolyploid lineages. Eight distinct annual lineages, that have traditionally been placed in the genus Vulpia and in other fine-leaved ephemeral genera, have apparently emerged from different perennial Festuca ancestors. The phenotypically similar Vulpia taxa have been reconstructed as polyphyletic, with polyploid lineages showing unclear relationships to their purported diploid relatives. Interspecific and intergeneric hybridization is, however, rampant across different lineages. An evolutionary analysis based on cloned nuclear low-copy GBSSI (Granule-Bound Starch Synthase I) and multicopy ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) sequences has been conducted on representatives of most Vulpia species and other fine-leaved lineages, using Bayesian consensus and agreement trees, networking split graphs and species tree-based approaches, to disentangle their phylogenetic relationships and to identify the parental genome donors of the allopolyploids. Both data sets were able to reconstruct a congruent phylogeny in which Vulpia was resolved as polyphyletic from at least three main ancestral diploid lineages. These, in turn, participated in the origin of the derived allopolyploid Vulpia lineages together with other Festuca-like, Psilurus-like and some unknown genome donors. Long-distance dispersal events were inferred to explain the polytopic origin of the Mediterranean and American Vulpia lineages. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Background: Misidentifications between exploited species may lead to inaccuracies in population assessments, with potentially irreversible conservation ramifications if overexploitation of either species is occurring. A notable showcase is provided by the realization that the roundscale spearfish (Tetrapturus georgii), a recently validated species, has been historically misidentified as the morphologically very similar and severely overfished white marlin (Kajikia albida) (IUCN listing: Vulnerable). In effect, no information exists on the population status and evolutionary history of the enigmatic roundscale spearfish, a large, highly vagile and broadly distributed pelagic species. We provide the first population genetic evaluation of the roundscale spearfish, utilizing nuclear microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA sequence markers. Furthermore, we re-evaluated existing white marlin mitochondrial genetic data and present our findings in a comparative context to the roundscale spearfish. Results: Microsatellite and mitochondrial (control region) DNA markers provided mixed evidence for roundscale spearfish population differentiation between the western north and south Atlantic regions, depending on marker-statistical analysis combination used. Mitochondrial DNA analyses provided strong signals of historical population growth for both white marlin and roundscale spearfish, but higher genetic diversity and effective female population size (1.5-1.9X) for white marlin. Conclusions: The equivocal indications of roundscale spearfish population structure, combined with a smaller effective female population size compared to the white marlin, already a species of concern, suggests that a species-specific and precautionary management strategy recognizing two management units is prudent for this newly validated billfish. © 2014 Bernard et al.","In this article we stochastically characterize a reservoir through the modeling of stratigraphic columns using two algorithms: Metropolis-Hasting and Gibbs sampling by blocks; both constitute Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The stratigraphic unit considered corresponds to the C4 sands of the Misoa Formation, on Lama Field, at the Maracaibo Lake, consisting of inter-bedded sandstones with scarce intercalations of siltstone and shale. Using the information of 11 wells located in the study area, 20 new pseudo-columns were modeled in new locations by means of both algorithms. Combining the information of real columns and the estimated ones, maps of sand content were generated. The Metropolis-Hasting algorithm reproduced, mainly, the presence of sands along the pseudo-sequences generated, which represent more than 70% of the sediment present in the study area. This algorithm suggests the areas where the main variations of sand content could occur, but does not seem to be sensible enough to detect the facies variations of silt and clay. The maps obtained with the Gibbs-by-block algorithm, like that using Metropolis-Hasting, clearly show a NE-SW trend in sand content which correlate with the results of previous works in the area. Furthermore, the Gibbs-by-block algorithm developed here is capable of reproducing the presence of fine layers of the other lithologies observed in the area, if a geologically well thought-out length for the block is used.","This paper presents the design of an electrical energy conversion system (EECS) for the use of solar energy and its conditioning for injection of energy to the commercial power grid. A single-phase full-bridge inverter with transformerless H5 topology coupled to an LCL filter is used. The system is identified using an averaged small-signal state space model; while the used cascade control scheme is tuned by pole placement and includes a maximum power disturb-observe tracking type algorithm of that increases efficiency by operating the system at the optimum operating point of the solar panel. This design describes essential technical aspects in the components sizing and selection for experimental development, as well as the control structure design for a good performance to face systems perturbations.","We consider the problem of recovering a probability density on a bounded or unbounded subset D of [0,∞), from the knowledge of its sequence of fractional moments within a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) setup. Based upon entropy convergence results previously formulated, the fractional moments are selected so that the entropy of the MaxEnt approximation be minimum. A geometric interpretation of the reconstruction procedure is formulated as follows: the two moment curves generated by the unknown density and its MaxEnt approximation are interpolating in Hermite-Birkoff sense; that is, they are both interpolating and tangent at the selected nodes.

These priors may have heavier tails than Student-t priors, and the variances have a sensible behaviour both at the origin and at the tail, making it suitable for objective analysis. Since the representation of our proposal is a scale mixture, it is suitable to detect sudden changes in the model. Finally, we propose a Gibbs sampler using this new family of priors for modelling outliers and structural breaks in Bayesian dynamic linear models. We demonstrate in a published example, that our proposal is more suitable than the Inverted Gamma's assumption for the variances, which makes very hard to detect structural changes. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2014.","Aim: To examine the effect of geographical barriers and habitat dynamics related to climatic oscillations on the phylogeography of a widespread passerine of Neotropical cloud forests, the spotted barbtail (Premnoplex brunnescens). Location: Neotropical humid forests of montane areas in lower Central America and South America. Methods: We sequenced two mitochondrial genes and one nuclear intron from specimens collected across the distribution of P. brunnescens. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using Bayesian and maximum-likelihood methods. Groups with maximum differentiation were estimated with spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA). We estimated timing of differentiation and relationships among groups with a species-tree approach and historical demography with extended Bayesian skyline plots. Results: Six highly differentiated clades of P. brunnescens are distributed in lower Central America, Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, northern Venezuelan mountains, the Northern Andes, central Peru, and southern Peru and Bolivia. Within the Northern Andes clade, six phylogroups were identified associated with different slopes and isolated cordilleras. Most clades occupy opposite sides of low-lying valleys and ridgelines, but little differentiation was observed across several putative barriers. Population divergence occurred in the late Miocene and Pliocene, perhaps in association with Andean uplift. Historical fluctuations in population sizes suggest that populations tracked the spatial dynamics of montane forests associated with glacial cycles. Main conclusions: Extensive genetic differentiation in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA exists among populations of P. brunnescens. Such marked divergence was probably promoted by the rugged topography and dynamic ecological history of the Neotropical mountains. Our study sheds light on mechanisms promoting population differentiation in the montane Neotropics. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Although speculative activity is central to black markets for currency, the out-of-sample performance of structural models in those settings is unknown. We substantially update the literature on empirical determinants of black market rates and evaluate the out-of-sample performance of linear models and non-parametric Bayesian treed Gaussian process (BTGP) models against the random walk benchmark. Fundamentals-based models outperform the benchmark in out-of-sample prediction accuracy and trading rule profitability measures given future values of fundamentals. In simulated real-time trading exercises, however, the BTGP achieves superior realized profitability, accuracy and market timing, while linear models do no better than a random walk. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","The most diverse and species-rich class of the phylum Porifera is Demospongiae. In recent years, the systematics of this clade, which contains more than 7000 species, has developed rapidly in light of new studies combining molecular and morphological observations. We add more than 500 new, nearly complete 18S sequences (an increase of more than 200%) in an attempt to further enhance understanding of the phylogeny of Demospongiae. Our study specifically targets representation of type species and genera that have never been sampled for any molecular data in an effort to accelerate progress in classifying this diverse lineage. Our analyses recover four highly supported subclasses of Demospongiae: Keratosa, Myxospongiae, Haploscleromorpha, and Heteroscleromorpha. Within Keratosa, neither Dendroceratida, nor its two families, Darwinellidae and Dictyodendrillidae, are monophyletic and Dictyoceratida is divided into two lineages, one predominantly composed of Dysideidae and the second containing the remaining families (Irciniidae, Spongiidae, Thorectidae, and Verticillitidae). Within Myxospongiae, we find Chondrosida to be paraphyletic with respect to the Verongida. We amend the latter to include species of the genus Chondrosia and erect a new order Chondrillida to contain remaining taxa from Chondrosida, which we now discard. Even with increased taxon sampling of Haploscleromorpha, our analyses are consistent with previous studies; however, Haliclona species are interspersed in even more clades. Haploscleromorpha contains five highly supported clades, each more diverse than previously recognized, and current families are mostly polyphyletic. In addition, we reassign Janulum spinispiculum to Haploscleromorpha and resurrect Reniera filholi as Janulum filholi comb. nov. Within the large clade Heteroscleromorpha, we confirmed 12 recently identified clades based on alternative data, as well as a sister-group relationship between the freshwater Spongillida and the family Vetulinidae. We transfer Stylissa flabelliformis to the genus Scopalina within the family Scopalinidae, which is of uncertain position. Our analyses uncover a large, strongly supported clade containing all heteroscleromorphs other than Spongillida, Vetulinidae, and Scopalinidae. Within this clade, there is a major division separating Axinellidae, Biemnida, Tetractinellida, Bubaridae, Stelligeridae, Raspailiidae, and some species of Petromica, Topsentia, and Axinyssa from Agelasida, Polymastiidae, Placospongiidae, Clionaidae, Spirastrellidae, Tethyidae, Poecilosclerida, Halichondriidae, Suberitidae, and Trachycladus. Among numerous results: (1) Spirophorina and its family Tetillidae are paraphyletic with respect to a strongly supported Astrophorina within Tetractinellida; (2) Agelasida is the earliest diverging lineage within the second clade listed above; and (3) Merlia and Desmacella appear to be the earliest diverging lineages of Poecilosclerida. © 2013 Published by Oxford University Press.","The highly collaborative research sponsored by the NSF-funded Assembling the Porifera Tree of Life (PorToL) project is providing insights into some of the most difficult questions in metazoan systematics. Our understanding of phylogenetic relationships within the phylum Porifera has changed considerably with increased taxon sampling and data from additional molecular markers. PorToL researchers have falsified earlier phylogenetic hypotheses, discovered novel phylogenetic alliances, found phylogenetic homes for enigmatic taxa, and provided a more precise understanding of the evolution of skeletal features, secondary metabolites, body organization, and symbioses. Some of these exciting new discoveries are shared in the papers that form this issue of Integrative and Comparative Biology. Our analyses of over 300 nearly complete 28S ribosomal subunit gene sequences provide specific case studies that illustrate how our dataset confirms new hypotheses of sponge evolution. We recovered monophyletic clades for all 4 classes of sponges, as well as the 4 major clades of Demospongiae (Keratosa, Myxospongiae, Haploscleromorpha, and Heteroscleromorpha), but our phylogeny differs in several aspects from traditional classifications. In most major clades of sponges, families within orders appear to be paraphyletic. Although additional sampling of genes and taxa are needed to establish whether this pattern results from a lack of phylogenetic resolution or from a paraphyletic classification system, many of our results are congruent with those obtained from 18S ribosomal subunit gene sequences and complete mitochondrial genomes. These data provide further support for a revision of the traditional classification of sponges. © 2013 The Author.","Prediction error (i.e., the difference between the expected and the actual event's outcome) mediates adaptive behavior. Activity in the anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC) and in the anterior insula (aINS) is associated with the commission of prediction errors under uncertainty. We propose a dynamic causal model of effective connectivity (i.e., neuronal coupling) between the aMCC, the aINS, and the striatum in which the task context drives activity in the aINS and the temporal prediction errors modulate extrinsic cingulate-insular connections. With functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 15 participants when they performed a temporal prediction task. They observed visual animations and predicted when a stationary ball began moving after being contacted by another moving ball. To induced uncertainty-driven prediction errors, we introduced spatial gaps and temporal delays between the balls. Classical and Bayesian fMRI analyses provided evidence to support that the aMCC-aINS system along with the striatum not only responds when humans predict whether a dynamic event occurs but also when it occurs. Our results reveal that the insula is the entry port of a three-region pathway involved in the processing of temporal predictions. Moreover, prediction errors rather than attentional demands, task difficulty, or task duration exert an influence in the aMCC-aINS system. Prediction errors debilitate the effect of the aMCC on the aINS. Finally, our computational model provides a way forward to characterize the physiological parallel of temporal prediction errors elicited in dynamic tasks. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Malaria is a parasitic infectious tropical disease that causes high mortality rates in the tropical belt. In Venezuela, Sucre state is considered the third state with most disease prevalence. This paper presents a hierarchical regression log-Poisson space-time model within a Bayesian approach to represent the incidence of malaria in Sucre state, Venezuela, during the period 1990-2002 in 15 municipalities of the state. Several additive models for the logarithm of the relative risk of the disease for each district were considered. These models differ in their structure by including different combinations of social-economic and climatic covariates in a multiple regression term. A random effect that captures the spatial heterogeneity in the study region, and a CAR (Conditionally Autoregressive) component that recognizes the effect of nearby municipalities in the transmission of the disease each year, are also included in the model. A simpler version without including the CAR component was also fitted to the data. Model estimation and predictive inference was carried out through the implementation of a computer code in the WinBUGS software, which makes use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. For model selection the criterion of minimum posterior predictive loss (D) was used. The Moran I statistic was calculated to test the independence of the residuals of the resulting model. Finally, we verify the model fit by using the Bayesian p-value, and in most cases the selected model captures the spatial structure of the relative risks among the neighboring municipalities each year. For years with a poor model fit, the t-Student distribution is used as an alternative model for the spatial local random effect with better fit to the tail behavior of the data probability distribution. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Background: Demosponges are challenging for phylogenetic systematics because of their plastic and relatively simple morphologies and many deep divergences between major clades. To improve understanding of the phylogenetic relationships within Demospongiae, we sequenced and analyzed seven nuclear housekeeping genes involved in a variety of cellular functions from a diverse group of sponges. Methodology/Principal Findings: We generated data from each of the four sponge classes (i.e., Calcarea, Demospongiae, Hexactinellida, and Homoscleromorpha), but focused on family-level relationships within demosponges. With data for 21 newly sampled families, our Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian-based approaches recovered previously phylogenetically defined taxa: Keratosap, Myxospongiaep, Spongillidap, Haploscleromorphap (the marine haplosclerids) and Democlaviap. We found conflicting results concerning the relationships of Keratosap and Myxospongiaep to the remaining demosponges, but our results strongly supported a clade of Haploscleromorphap+Spongillidap+Democlaviap. In contrast to hypotheses based on mitochondrial genome and ribosomal data, nuclear housekeeping gene data suggested that freshwater sponges (Spongillidap) are sister to Haploscleromorphap rather than part of Democlaviap. Within Keratosap, we found equivocal results as to the monophyly of Dictyoceratida. Within Myxospongiaep, Chondrosida and Verongida were monophyletic. A well-supported clade within Democlaviap, Tetractinellidap, composed of all sampled members of Astrophorina and Spirophorina (including the only lithistid in our analysis), was consistently revealed as the sister group to all other members of Democlaviap. Within Tetractinellidap, we did not recover monophyletic Astrophorina or Spirophorina. Our results also reaffirmed the monophyly of order Poecilosclerida (excluding Desmacellidae and Raspailiidae), and polyphyly of Hadromerida and Halichondrida. Conclusions/Significance: These results, using an independent nuclear gene set, confirmed many hypotheses based on ribosomal and/or mitochondrial genes, and they also identified clades with low statistical support or clades that conflicted with traditional morphological classification. Our results will serve as a basis for future exploration of these outstanding questions using more taxon- and gene-rich datasets.","Research on mayflies biogeography in the American continent have been generally narrative, proposing centers of origin and dispersal routes, suggesting distribution patterns for certain genera. Few researches have addressed the species level. In order to determine potential distribution patterns for species of Thraulodes, we used MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy), software based on the fundamental ecological niche model. From georeferenced records of 51 species we generated distribution patterns for 15 species that had 5 or more records. Area under Curve (AUC) data were close to 1 for T. brunneus, T. cochunaensis, T. consorts, T. eccentricus, T. gonzalesi, T. itatiajanus, T. lunatus, T. pacaya, T. packeri, T. paysandensis, T. Speciosus, T. schlingeri, T. tenulineus and T. zonalis, except for T. grandis. Across the continent, the variable determining the distributions was the ecoregion, and to a lesser extent those related to temperature and precipitation. Species with distributions ranges that go from the Mesoamerican domain (Caribbean subregion of the Neotropics) to the Nearctic appear to tend to overlapping and are less restricted than those species of South American Neotropics.","In this paper, we propose, evaluate and compare two detectors of apnea-bradycardia episodes, based on hidden Markov models (HMM) and hidden semi-Markov models (HSMM). Evaluation is performed on a database of 233 apnea-bradycardia episodes manually annotated. The acquired ECG signals are processed to obtain RR series. The proposed detectors, applied to these RR series, are composed of two HMM or HSMM models, each one representing two distinct physiopathological states: absence and presence of apnea-bradycardia. A learning phase is firstly applied to each model in order to estimate their parameters from a learning dataset. Then, using a sliding window, the models are applied to a set of new observations, to compute the log-likelihood of each model for each time instant. Detection of the events of interest is based on the comparison of log-likelihoods with respect to a threshold. The optimal detection configuration was obtained in terms of sensitivity, specificity and detection delay. Results show that the analysis of the dynamics of RR series, through the HSMM, allows for a significant improvement of sensitivity (90.38% vs 88.42%) and specificity (92.23% vs 89.67%), with a reduction of the detection delay (0.92±3.56s vs 1.60±3.72s). © 2012 CCAL.","The optimal design of complex systems in engineering requires the availability of mathematical models of system's behavior as a function of a set of design variables; such models allow the designer to search for the best solution to the design problem. However, system models (e.g., computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, physical prototypes) are usually time-consuming and expensive to evaluate, and thus unsuited for systematic use during design. Approximate models of system behavior based on limited data, also known as metamodels, allow significant savings by reducing the resources devoted to modeling during the design process. In this work in engineering design based on multiple performance criteria, we propose the use of multi-response Bayesian surrogate models (MR-BSM) to model several aspects of system behavior jointly, instead of modeling each individually. To this end, we formulated a family of multiresponse correlation functions, suitable for prediction of several response variables that are observed simultaneously from the same computer simulation. Using a set of test functions with varying degrees of correlation, we compared the performance of MR-BSM against metamodels built individually for each response. Our results indicate that MR-BSM outperforms individual metamodels in 53 to 75 of the test cases, though the relative performance depends on the sample size, sampling scheme and the actual correlation among the observed response values. In addition, the relative performance of MR-BSM versus individual metamodels was contingent upon the ability to select an appropriate covariance/correlation function for each application, a task for which a modified version of Akaike's Information Criterion was observed to be inadequate. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.","We show the results of a non-parametric, fully bayesian implementation of a spectral fitting algorithm, designed to calculate the main physical parameters that govern the galaxy assembly process.

Environmental covariates included (a) bioclimatic data; (b) elevation; (c) geology; and (d) soil. Model selection was based on graphic analyses of omission/commission, and Akaike information criterion (AIC), small sample size corrected AIC (AICc) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Models incorporating all of the above covariates performed best. The predicted suitable habitat range adjusted well to the known range of A. amplus. However, our analysis identifies northern Brazil as a spot requiring further research to determine the presence of A. amplus. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Background: The Venezuelan Amerindians were, until recently, free of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, in 2007, HIV-1 infection was detected for the first time in the Warao Amerindian population living in the Eastern part of Venezuela, in the delta of the Orinoco river. The aim of this study was to analyze the genetic diversity of the HIV-1 circulating in this population. Methodology/Principal Findings: The pol genomic region was sequenced for 16 HIV-1 isolates and for some of them, sequences from env, vif and nef genomic regions were obtained. All HIV-1 isolates were classified as subtype B, with exception of one that was classified as subtype C. The 15 subtype B isolates exhibited a high degree of genetic similarity and formed a highly supported monophyletic cluster in each genomic region analyzed. Evolutionary analyses of the pol genomic region indicated that the date of the most recent common ancestor of the Waraos subtype B clade dates back to the late 1990s. Conclusions/Significance: At least two independent introductions of HIV-1 have occurred in the Warao Amerindians from Venezuela. The HIV-1 subtype B was successfully established and got disseminated in the community, while no evidence of local dissemination of the HIV-1 subtype C was detected in this study. These results warrant further surveys to evaluate the burden of this disease, which can be particularly devastating in this Amerindian population, with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, hepatitis B, among other infectious diseases, and with limited access to primary health care. © 2012 Rangel et al.","Most widespread birds of Neotropical cloud forests exhibit phenotypic variation that is partitioned geographically suggesting allopatric divergence, but little is known about the extent to which such phenotypic differentiation is consistent with genetic variation. We studied geographic patterns of genetic differentiation in the Three-striped Warbler (Basileuterus tristriatus), a polytypic and widespread understory bird of the foothills and mid-elevation zone of the tropical Andes and adjacent mountains of Central and South America. We sequenced mitochondrial DNA for 196 samples covering the entire range of B. tristriatus, as well as 22 samples of its putative closest relatives: the Three-banded (B. trifasciatus) and Santa Marta (B. basilicus) warblers. We found deep genetic structure across the range of B. tristriatus, which consisted of ten major clades including B. trifasciatus, a species that was nested within B. tristriatus. In contrast, B. basilicus was not closely related to B. tristriatus but part of a clade of Myiothlypis warblers. Geographic boundaries among clades were clearly related to lowland gaps separating subspecies groups. The subspecies melanotis of the mountains of Central America was sister to a large clade including B. t. tacarcunae, and the rest of South American clades, including B. trifasciatus. Five clades are found in the northern Andes, where no signs of gene flow were found across barriers such as the Táchira Depression or the Magdalena valley. Our study highlights the importance of valleys in promoting and maintaining divergence in a lower montane forest bird. The substantial genetic and phenotypic differentiation, and the paraphyly uncovered in B. tristriatus, may call for revising its species boundaries. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","The family Mugilidae comprises mainly coastal marine species that are widely distributed in all tropical, subtropical and temperate seas. Mugilid species are generally considered to be ecologically important and they are a major food resource for human populations in certain parts of the world. The taxonomy and systematics of the Mugilidae are still much debated and based primarily on morphological characters. In this study, we provide the first comprehensive molecular systematic account of the Mugilidae using phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide sequence variation at three mitochondrial loci (16S rRNA, cytochrome oxidase I, and cytochrome b) for 257 individuals from 55 currently recognized species. The study covers all 20 mugilid genera currently recognized as being valid. The family comprises seven major lineages that radiated early on from the ancestor to all current forms. All genera that were represented by two species or more, except Cestraeus, turned out to be paraphyletic or polyphyletic. Thus, the present phylogenetic results generally disagree with the current taxonomy at the genus level and imply that the anatomical characters used for the systematics of the Mugilidae may be poorly informative phylogenetically. The present results should provide a sound basis for a taxonomic revision of the mugilid genera. A proportion of the species with large distribution ranges (including Moolgarda seheli, Mugil cephalus and M. curema) appear to consist of cryptic species, thus warranting further taxonomic and genetic work at the infra-generic level. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Neotropical rivers are home to the largest assemblage of freshwater fishes, but little is known about the phylogeny of these fishes at the species level using multi-locus molecular markers. Here, we present a phylogeny for all known species of the genus Satanoperca, a widespread group of Neotropical cichlid fishes, based on analysis of six unlinked genetic loci. To test nominal and proposed species limits for this group, we surveyed mtDNA sequence variation among 320 individuals representing all know species. Most nominal species were supported by this approach but we determined that populations in the Xingu, Tapajós, and Araguaia. +. Paraná Rivers are likely undescribed species, while S. jurupari and S. mapiritensis did not show clear genetic distinction. To infer a phylogeny of these putative species, we conducted maximum likelihood and Bayesian non-clock and relaxed clock analyses of concatenated data from three genes (one mitochondrial, two nuclear). We also used a multi-species coalescent model to estimate a species tree from six unlinked loci (one mitochondrial, five nuclear). The topologies obtained were congruent with other results, but showed only minimal to moderate support for some nodes, suggesting that more loci will be needed to satisfactorily estimate the distribution of coalescent histories within Satanoperca. We determined that this variation results from topological discordance among separate gene trees, likely due to differential sorting of ancestral polymorphisms. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Studying the biogeography and the phylogeography of the endemic Macaronesian red Festuca species (Loliinae, Poaceae) is of prime interest in understanding the speciation and colonization patterns of recently evolved groups in oceanic archipelagos. Coalescence-based analyses of plastid trnLF sequences were employed to estimate evolutionary parameters and to test different species-history scenarios that model the pattern of species divergence. Bayesian IM estimates of species divergence times suggested that ancestral lineages of diploid Macaronesian and Iberian red fescues could have diverged between 1.2 and 1.57 Ma. When empirical data were compared to coalescence-based simulated distributions of discordance and p-distance statistics, two species-history models were chosen in which the first branching lineage derived in Canarian Festuca agustinii. Its sister lineage could have involved a recent polytomy leading to the Madeiran Festuca jubata, the Azorean Festuca francoi + Festuca petraea and the continental Festuca rivularis lineages (Canarian model) or the sequential branching of lineages leading to F. jubata and finally to the sister clades of F. rivularis and F. francoi + F. petraea (Sequential model). Nested clade phylogeographic analysis (NCPA) and a first adapted host-parasite co-evolutionary ParaFit method were used to detect the phylogeographic signal. NCPA inferred long-distance colonizations for the entire diploid red Festuca complex, but allopatric-fragmentation and isolation-by-distance (IBD) patterns were inferred within archipelagos. In addition, the ParaFit method suggested a generalized pattern of a stepping-stone model at all hierarchical levels. Maximum-likelihood-based dispersal- extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) models were superimposed on the Sequential model species tree. The three-independent-colonization (3IC) model was the best supported biogeographic scenario, concurring with previous analysis based on multilocus AFLP data. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","In Pericchi and Pereira [1] it is argued against the traditional way on which testing is based on fixed significance level, either using p-values (with fixed levels of evidence, like the 5% rule) or α values. We instead, follow an approach put forward by [2], on which an optimal test is chosen by minimizing type I and type II errors. Morris DeGroot in his authoritative book [2], Probability and Statistics 2nd Edition, stated that it is more reasonable to minimize a weighted sum of Type I andType II error than to specify a value of type I error and then minimize Type II error. He showed it beyond reasonable doubt, but only in the very restrictive scenario of simple VS simple hypothesis, and it is not clear how to generalize it. We propose here a very natural generalization for composite hypothesis, by using general weight functions in the parameter space. This was also the position taken by [3, 4, 5]. We show, in a parallel manner to DeGroot's proof and Pereira's discussion, that the optimal test statistics are Bayes Factors, when the weighting functions are priors with mass on the whole parameter space. On theother hand when the weight functions are point masses in specific parameter values of practical significance, then a procedureis designed for which the sum of Type I error and Type IIerror in the specified points of practical significance is minimized. This can be seen as bridge between Bayesian Statistics and a new version of Hypothesis testing, more in line with statistical consistency and scientific insight. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.","During the past three decades there has been a notable increase in dengue disease severity in Venezuela. Nevertheless, the population structure of the viruses being transmitted in this country is not well understood. Here, we present a molecular epidemiological study on dengue viruses (DENV) circulating in Aragua State, Venezuela during 2006-2007. Twenty-one DENV full-length genomes representing all of the four serotypes were amplified and sequenced directly from the serum samples. Notably, only DENV-2 was associated with severe disease. Phylogenetic trees constructed using Bayesian methods indicated that only one genotype was circulating for each serotype. However, extensive viral genetic diversity was found in DENV isolated from the same area during the same period, indicating significant in situ evolution since the introduction of these genotypes. Collectively, the results suggest that the non-structural (NS) proteins may play an important role in DENV evolution, particularly NS1, NS2A and NS4B proteins. The phylogenetic data provide evidence to suggest that multiple introductions of DENV have occurred from the Latin American region into Venezuela and vice versa. The implications of the significant viral genetic diversity generated during hyperendemic transmission, particularly in NS protein are discussed and considered in the context of future development and use of human monoclonal antibodies as antivirals and tetravalent vaccines. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","We develop a novel structural credit risk model that extends the original Merton model by allowing for stochastic interest rates and stochastic volatility. The model is estimated using Bayesian methods implemented via a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, in light of the demonstrable advantages of likelihood approaches and the importance of taking into account parameter uncertainty documented in the literature. We solve the nontrivial computational problem of contingent claim valuation in our set-up by using a Taylor series approximation to the expectation of the claim payoffs under the risk-neutral measure. Finally, we illustrate our model and compare it against the Merton model with real data on a nonfinancial firm (Ford Motor Company) and three financial firms (Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Lehman Brothers) during the recent financial crisis. © The Author, 2014.

In this paper we define a class of stochastic volatility models that uses opening and closing prices along with the minimum and maximum prices within a trading period to infer the dynamics underlying the volatility process of asset prices and compare it with similar models presented previously in the literature. The paper also discusses sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to fit this class of models and illustrates its features using both a simulation study and real data. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","We applied deterministic and stochastic seismic inversion methods to 3D data of La Creciente field in Colombia, with focus on gas and lithology identification. Our deterministic inversion considers an elastic isotropic medium model to jointly estimate Vp, Vs, density and source wavelet deviations. We estimate the probability of the gas sands with multivariate Gaussian classification based on seismic-derived elastic properties and petrophysical characterization. Our study shows that Ciénaga de Oro gas reservoir is characterized by lower density, moderately lower Vp and moderately larger Vs than surrounding strata and non-producing Ciénaga de Oro intervals. To further exploit the seismic and petrophysical information, we applied a stochastic petrophysical seismic inversion. The method combines the geostatistical modeling of reservoir parameters (porosity, shale fraction and saturation), a rock physics model for the prediction of the elastic properties and seismic modeling. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method we generate a large number of realizations of the reservoir and elastic parameters that jointly honor the seismic observations, the rock physics model and the prior information. With this approach we describe the posterior uncertainties of the reservoir properties including the gas saturation. © 2012 SEG.","It has been proposed that the subgenus Archaeotityus comprises the most ancient species group within the medically important scorpion genus Tityus. cDNA encoding sodium-channel active toxins from the type species of this subgenus, Tityus clathratus (central Venezuela), have been isolated and sequenced. Two cDNAs were retrieved that encoded 61 amino acid-long putative neurotoxins named Tcl1 and Tcl2. Sequence identity was highest (87%) when both were compared with β-toxin Ts1 from the Brazilian scorpion Tityus serrulatus and its homologs from T. bahiensis, T. stigmurus, and T. costatus. A Bayesian analysis indicated statistical support for the grouping of T. clathratus Tcl1 and Tcl2 with Brazilian gamma-like β-toxins, reinforcing previous phylogenetic studies which suggested an evolutionary relationship between the subgenus Archaeotityus and scorpion species inhabiting southeast South America belonging to the subgenus Tityus. © CEVAP 2012.","Hierarchical Bayesian space-time models have been used in the mapping of disease, studies of environmental pollution and industrial pollution, among many others. Under this methodology, the data is associated with point in a locality E and an instant in time t. The aim of this work is to model the relative risk of dengue in Girardot Municipality, Aragua State, Venezuela, during the epidemic period 2009. In that sense, we propose three models. First, a binomial model that measures the variability in the count of occurrence of the disease in the parishes of the municipality. A second model includes the binomial model as a first hierarchical level, plus a second level which introduces the spatial effect, the temporal effect and space-time interaction. Finally, a third spatial model that follows a Poisson model at the first level of hierarchy for the number of cases, and in the second level of hierarchy relates the relative risk associated with covariates through the logarithm function over a random effect. Data were collected for weeks and classified according to the parishes of the municipality. The Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) was used to select the best model. The Poisson model was best suited to represent the relative risk of contracting dengue in the area under study, showing that high-risk patterns were found in the parishes located in the south and southwest of the Girardot municipality, some of them bordering the lake of Valencia.","In this work, we propose a detection method that exploits not only the instantaneous values, but also the intrinsic dynamics of the RR series, for the detection of apnea-bradycardia episodes in preterm infants. A hidden semi-Markov model is proposed to represent and characterize the temporal evolution of observed RR series and different pre-processing methods of these series are investigated. This approach is quantitatively evaluated through synthetic and real signals, the latter being acquired in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Compared to two conventional detectors used in NICU our best detector shows an improvement of around 13% in sensitivity and 7% in specificity. Furthermore, a reduced detection delay of approximately 3 seconds is obtained with respect to conventional detectors. © 2011 IEEE.","Dengue virus currently causes 50-100. million infections annually. Comprehensive knowledge about the evolution of Dengue in response to selection pressure is currently unavailable, but would greatly enhance vaccine design efforts. In the current study, we sequenced 187 new dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) genotype III whole genomes isolated from Asia and the Americas. We analyzed them together with previously-sequenced isolates to gain a more detailed understanding of the evolutionary adaptations existing in this prevalent American serotype. In order to analyze the phylogenetic dynamics of DENV-3 during outbreak periods; we incorporated datasets of 48 and 11 sequences spanning two major outbreaks in Venezuela during 2001 and 2007-2008, respectively. Our phylogenetic analysis of newly sequenced viruses shows that subsets of genomes cluster primarily by geographic location, and secondarily by time of virus isolation. DENV-3 genotype III sequences from Asia are significantly divergent from those from the Americas due to their geographical separation and subsequent speciation. We measured amino acid variation for the E protein by calculating the Shannon entropy at each position between Asian and American genomes. We found a cluster of seven amino acid substitutions having high variability within E protein domain III, which has previously been implicated in serotype-specific neutralization escape mutants. No novel mutations were found in the E protein of sequences isolated during either Venezuelan outbreak. Shannon entropy analysis of the NS5 polymerase mature protein revealed that a G374E mutation, in a region that contributes to interferon resistance in other flaviviruses by interfering with JAK-STAT signaling was present in both the Asian and American sequences from the 2007-2008 Venezuelan outbreak, but was absent in the sequences from the 2001 Venezuelan outbreak. In addition to E, several NS5 amino acid changes were unique to the 2007-2008 epidemic in Venezuela and may give additional insight into the adaptive response of DENV-3 at the population level. © 2011.","The whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is an important pest due to its capacity for producing strong infestations and transmitting plant viruses. The New World putative species of B. tabaci complex (NW) is the indigenous whitefly of the Americas, but only the invasive Middle East-Asia Minor 1 putative species of B. tabaci complex (MEAM1), commonly referred to as the \"B biotype\" was identified in a limited scope sampling in Venezuela. Similarly to MEAM1 invasions elsewhere, in this South American country there has been an increase in the geographic range and abundance of B. tabaci, and in the number of viruses that it transmits since the late 1980s. We estimated the diversity of B. tabaci to elucidate their role in the epidemiology of geminiviruses in Venezuela. Thirteen microsatellite loci were screened in samples collected from 19 localities in ten major agricultural states. A Bayesian clustering method (Structure) grouped the samples into two genetic groups. Control samples from whiteflies NW and MEAM1 and partial sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene showed that our samples of B. tabaci populations from Venezuela fall within NW and MEAM1 groups. In this survey, MEAM1 was predominant over NW whitefly in a proportion of 35:1. No evidence was observed for gene flow between indigenous and invader whitefly. Altogether, our results stress the urgency for controlling the proliferation of the invasive whitefly. © 2011 Springer Science & Business Media BV.","Patterns of diversification in species-rich clades provide insight into the processes that generate biological diversity. We tested different models of lineage and phenotypic diversification in an exceptional continental radiation, the ovenbird family Furnariidae, using the most complete species-level phylogenetic hypothesis produced to date for a major avian clade (97% of 293 species). We found that the Furnariidae exhibit nearly constant rates of lineage accumulation but show evidence of constrained morphological evolution. This pattern of sustained high rates of speciation despite limitations on phenotypic evolution contrasts with the results of most previous studies of evolutionary radiations, which have found a pattern of decelerating diversity-dependent lineage accumulation coupled with decelerating or constrained phenotypic evolution. Our results suggest that lineage accumulation in tropical continental radiations may not be as limited by ecological opportunities as in temperate or island radiations. More studies examining patterns of both lineage and phenotypic diversification are needed to understand the often complex tempo and mode of evolutionary radiations on continents. © 2011 The Author(s).

The analysis is performed over a sample of synthetic spectra covering a wide range of star formation histories and seen at different ages and redshifts. Using the bayesian approach we can establish quantitatively the uncertainties in the parameters derived from these fits in a straightforward manner, which is not possible using some simple algorithms, e.g. GASPEX, a non-negative least-square fitting algorithm. © 2012 International Astronomical Union.","Extracting market expectations has always been an important issue when making national policies and investment decisions in financial markets. In options markets, the most popular way has been to extract implied volatilities to assess the future variability of the underlying asset with the use of the Black-Scholes formula. In this manuscript, we propose a novel way to extract the whole time varying distribution of the market implied asset price from option prices. We use a Bayesian non-parametric method that makes use of the Sethuraman representation for Dirichlet processes to take into account the evolution of distributions in time. As an illustration, we present an analysis of options on the S&P500 index. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) is the most important virus affecting papaya and cucurbit plants in tropical and subtropical areas. PRSV isolates are divided into biotypes P and W: both the P and W types naturally infect plants in the family Cucurbitaceae, whereas the P type naturally infects papaya (Carica papaya). Understanding the origin and nature of the PRSV genetic diversity and evolution is critical for the implementation of control strategies based on cross-protection and the deployment of transgenic plants that show resistance to virus isolates highly similar to the transgene. The molecular epidemiology of PRSV was evaluated by analyzing the nucleotide sequence of the capsid protein (CP) and helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) genes of isolates from around the world, including newly characterized ones from Colombia and Venezuela, using a relaxed molecular clock-based approach and a phylogeographic study. Our results confirm previous estimates on the origin of PRSV around 400 years ago and suggest distinct dispersion events from the Indian Peninsula to the rest of Asia, via Thailand, and subsequently to the Americas. A historical reconstruction of the P- and W-type characters in the phylogenetic study supports the need to revise the hypothesis that PRSV-P derives from PRSV-W since our results suggest that the ancestral state could be either of the two biotypes. Moreover, estimates of epidemic growth predict an increasing genetic diversity of the virus over time that has direct implications for control strategies of PRSV based on cross-protection and the use of transgenic plants. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","We develop a class of models for processes indexed in time and space that are based on autoregressive (AR) processes at each location. We use a Bayesian hierarchical structure to impose spatial coherence for the coeficients of the AR processes. The priors on such coefficients consist of spatial processes that guarantee time stationarity at each point in the spatial domain. The AR structures are coupled with a dynamic model for the mean of the process, which is expressed as a linear combination of time-varying parameters. We use satellite data on sea surface temperature for the North Pacific to illustrate how the model can be used to separate trends, cycles, and short-term variability for high-frequency environmental data.

Modeling extreme rainfall behavior is important due to the impact of natural hazards on highly vulnerable zones. In this regard, and within the framework of the classical extreme theory, the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) model is proposed for the study of the behavior of extreme rainfall events in Venezuela. A Bayesian approach was used to estimate model parameters and to make predictive inference of the GEV model. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were used to get samples from the posterior distributions of the GEV model parameters. Numerical results are presented for six locations in Venezuela representing different mesoclimate types: La Mariposa (Miranda State); San Francisco de Macanao (Nueva Esparta State); Villa El Rosario (Zulia State); Machiques (Zulia State); Carora (Lara State); and San Carlos de Río Negro (Amazonas State). Simulations from the predictive distribution suggest that the Fr échet and Gumbel models are more appropriate to represent the annual maxima in most of the study locations; however, in locations with extreme conditions within arid or highly humid mesoclimates, the Weibull model is more appropriate to represent annual rainfall maxima.","Metamodels have been proposed in the literature to reduce the time and resources devoted to design space exploration, to learn about design trade-offs, and to find the best solution to the design problem in the context of simulation-based design and optimization. In previous work in engineering design based on multiple performance criteria, we have proposed the use of Multi-response Bayesian Surrogate Models (MR-BSM) to model several response variables simultaneously, instead of modeling them independently. By doing so, it is expected that the correlation among the response variables can be used to achieve better models with smaller data sets. In this work, we extend the capabilities of MR-BSM by developing a multistage formulation with non-stationary covariance functions. This formulation for multi-response metamodeling in successive stages of experimental design, data acquisition and model fitting, enables the integration of different sources of information about system responses, with different levels of accuracy, into a single, global model of the system. The feasibility of the proposed formulation is demonstrated with an example in which two test functions are jointly approximated in two stages. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of the methodology to take advantage of a priori information, expressed as upper and lower bounds on the responses, to improve the accuracy of the metamodels. Results show that the use of bound information can result in order-of-magnitude improvements in metamodel accuracy. © 2010 by ASME.","The changing climate is one of the main environmental problems facing humanity, since slight variations in the climate variables might have terrible consequences in the economic activities and human well-being. Nowadays atmospheric Global Circulation Models (GCMs) are the main tools to study changing climate. The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MENR) led in 2005 the First Communication in Climate Change of Venezuela, using the outputs of 16 GCMs at a global scale (resolution of 5° × 5°) whose projections estimate increasing temperature and diminishing precipitation in the coming years. Each GCM gives different results, generating uncertainty in the future changing climate signal. This work uses a Bayesian approach and an extension of the Reliability Ensemble Average (REA) (Tebaldi et al. 2005) method, combining the outputs (present and future) of precipitation and temperature of the 16 GCMs with observations of present climate conditions, to determine the probability distributions of future changing climate change for these two climate variables in 9 regions in Venezuela. For this study, two criteria are used: bias, which considers the difference between the model outputs and the present climate; and convergence, which quantifies the differences among the simulated changes of future climate by multiple models. The main result of this work is that a large amount of uncertainty still exists in the GCMs projections, since they as yet do not include all aspects of the climate system functioning. It was also concluded that the lower the natural variability in the climate variable, the more effective is its projection.","In order of evaluating first service fertility (FPS) on dual purpose heifers, this research was carry out with the electronic records from two commercial herds. A total of 6,823 records from crossbred animals. The response variable was first service fertility of the heifers. The analyses were realized under two approaches: classic and Bayesian. For the classic analysis, it was used a simple animal model that included the discrete fixed effects of herd, breed group and year-season of service, as well as the covariates age at the first service and weaning weight, both in quadratic form. In addition, it included the random additive direct genetic effect of the animal and the residual. In the first case, the analyses were realized with the program MTDFREML. Whereas in the second case, the data were analyzed with the same model animal in a threshold form, for which was used the program MTGSAM. Under this approach the size of the sampling chain, the burn in period and the thinning rate were approximated with GIBBSIT program, whereas the analysis of posterior distribution of the sampling chain were realized with program GIBANAL. The overall length of the chain was 136,000 samples, discarding the first 1,000 and settling down a thinning rate retaining each 14th element of the sequence. The global percentage of FPS was of 65%. Under the classic approach the heritability was 0.03 ± 0.02, which once transformed to the underlying normal scale raised to 0.05. Meanwhile under the Bayesian approach the analysis of the 9,642 samples reflected that the average of the posterior distribution of the heritability was 0.0735; the median of the same distribution was 0.0650, with estimators in the rank between 0.0130 and 0.2270. Selection for this variable could only produce very slow changes in the population.","Background. Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. DENV are comprised of four distinct serotypes (DENV-1 through DENV-4) and each serotype can be divided in different genotypes. Currently, there is a dramatic emergence of DENV-3 genotype III in Latin America. Nevertheless, we still have an incomplete understanding of the evolutionary forces underlying the evolution of this genotype in this region of the world. In order to gain insight into the degree of genetic variability, rates and patterns of evolution of this genotype in Venezuela and the South American region, phylogenetic analysis, based on a large number (n = 119) of envelope gene sequences from DENV-3 genotype III strains isolated in Venezuela from 2001 to 2008, were performed.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed an in situ evolution of DENV-3 genotype III following its introduction in the Latin American region, where three different genetic clusters (A to C) can be observed among the DENV-3 genotype III strains circulating in this region. Bayesian coalescent inference analyses revealed an evolutionary rate of 8.48 × 10-4 substitutions/site/year (s/s/y) for strains of cluster A, composed entirely of strains isolated in Venezuela. Amino acid substitution at position 329 of domain III of the E protein (AV) was found in almost all E proteins from Cluster A strains. Conclusions. A significant evolutionary change between DENV-3 genotype III strains that circulated in the initial years of the introduction in the continent and strains isolated in the Latin American region in recent years was observed. The presence of DENV-3 genotype III strains belonging to different clusters was observed in Venezuela, revealing several introduction events into this country. The evolutionary rate found for Cluster A strains circulating in Venezuela is similar to the others previously established for this genotype in other regions of the world. This suggests a lack of correlation among DENV genotype III substitution rate and ecological pattern of virus spread. © 2010 Ramírez et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","The birds in the family Parulidae-commonly termed the New World warblers or wood-warblers-are a classic model radiation for studies of ecological and behavioral differentiation. Although the monophyly of a 'core' wood-warbler clade is well established, no phylogenetic hypothesis for this group has included a full sampling of wood-warbler species diversity. We used parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods to reconstruct relationships among all genera and nearly all wood-warbler species, based on a matrix of mitochondrial DNA (5840 nucleotides) and nuclear DNA (6 loci, 4602 nucleotides) characters. The resulting phylogenetic hypotheses provide a highly congruent picture of wood-warbler relationships, and indicate that the traditional generic classification of these birds recognizes many non-monophyletic groups. We recommend a revised taxonomy in which each of 14 genera (Seiurus, Helmitheros, Mniotilta, Limnothlypis, Protonotaria, Parkesia, Vermivora, Oreothlypis, Geothlypis, Setophaga, Myioborus, Cardellina, Basileuterus, Myiothlypis) corresponds to a well-supported clade; these nomenclatural changes also involve subsuming a number of well-known, traditional wood-warbler genera (Catharopeza, Dendroica, Ergaticus, Euthlypis, Leucopeza, Oporornis, Parula, Phaeothlypis, Wilsonia). We provide a summary phylogenetic hypothesis that will be broadly applicable to investigations of the historical biogeography, processes of diversification, and evolution of trait variation in this well studied avian group. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Dengue fever is a major public health problem in Aragua State, Venezuela. The situation has worsened in recent years, with a major epidemic during 2001. During 2002 and 2003 the exposition rates and relative risks of the municipalities that encompass Aragua State showed the highest relative risk of infection in the metropolitan area of Maracay. The municipalities of Girardot (capital), Francisco Linares Alcántara and Santiago Mariño concentrated the highest risk. During 2002 and 2003 the number of new dengue cases increased especially during the rainy season, showing the existence of a seasonal pattern. The present work presents Bayesian Hierarchical Models with spatio-temporal structure that included climatic and socioeconomic explanatory variables used to identify factors of major influence on dengue incidence and determined the municipalities with higher risks. Models were fitted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and selected using the deviance information criteria (DIC), respectively. These models constitute an important tool that epidemiologists and public health officers in Aragua State have to consider for the control of the vector Aedes aegypti Linnaeus.","The disturbance vicariance hypothesis (DV) has been proposed to explain speciation in Amazonia, especially its edge regions, e. g. in eastern Guiana Shield harlequin frogs (Atelopus) which are suggested to have derived from a cool-adapted Andean ancestor. In concordance with DV predictions we studied that (i) these amphibians display a natural distribution gap in central Amazonia; (ii) east of this gap they constitute a monophyletic lineage which is nested within a pre-Andean/western clade; (iii) climate envelopes of Atelopus west and east of the distribution gap show some macroclimatic divergence due to a regional climate envelope shift; (iv) geographic distributions of climate envelopes of western and eastern Atelopus range into central Amazonia but with limited spatial overlap. We tested if presence and apparent absence data points of Atelopus were homogenously distributed with Ripley's K function. A molecular phylogeny (mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene) was reconstructed using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference to study if Guianan Atelopus constitute a clade nested within a larger genus phylogeny. We focused on climate envelope divergence and geographic distribution by computing climatic envelope models with MaxEnt based on macroscale bioclimatic parameters and testing them by using Schoener's index and modified Hellinger distance. We corroborated existing DV predictions and, for the first time, formulated new DV predictions aiming on species' climate envelope change. Our results suggest that cool-adapted Andean Atelopus ancestors had dispersed into the Amazon basin and further onto the eastern Guiana Shield where, under warm conditions, they were forced to change climate envelopes. © 2010 The Author(s).","Over the last few years, research activity in approximation (e.g. metamodels) and optimization (e.g. genetic algorithms) methods has improved upon current practices in engineering design and optimization of complex systems with respect to multiple performance metrics, by reducing the number of evaluations of the system's model that are needed to obtain the set of non-dominated solutions to a given multi-objetive optimal design problem. To this end, several authors have proposed to enhance Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms (MOGAs) with metamodel-based pre-screening criteria (PSC), so that only those solutions that have the most potential to improve the current approximation of the Pareto Front are evaluated with the (costly) system model. The main goals of this work are to compare the performance of several PSC with an array of test functions taken from the literature, and to study the potential effect on their effectiveness and efficiency of using multi-response metamodels, instead of building independent, individual metamodels for each objective function, as has been done in previous work. Our preliminary results show that no single PSC is observed to be superior overall, though the Minimum of Minimum Distances and Expected Improvement criteria outperformed other PSC in most cases. Results also show that the use of multi-response metamodels improved both the effectiveness and efficiency of PSC and the quality of solution at the end of the optimization in 50% to 60% of test cases.

This group includes small, colourful, symbiotic species and much larger, reef-dwelling crabs targeted by fishermen. The evolutionary relationships between the species within this complex are not well-defined. Previous studies based upon morphological characters have proposed the separation of this complex into two genera (Mithrax and Mithraculus), but cladistic analyses based upon larval characters do not support this division. A molecular phylogeny of the group may help to resolve this long-standing taxonomic question and shed light on the ecological conditions driving the diversity of these crabs. Using a 550-bp alignment of the 16S rRNA mitochondrial DNA segment we examined the phylogenetic relationships between 8 species within the Mithrax-Mithraculus complex native to the Caribbean. The resulting phylogeny indicates that this complex is paraphyletic, as it includes the genus Microphrys. The analyses revealed a well-supported, monophyletic group containing four species of Mithraculus (M. cinctimanus, M. coryphe, M. sculptus and M. forceps) and supported one pair of sister species from the genus Mithrax (M. caribbaeus and M. spinosissimus). No complete segregation of species, according to genera, was evident, however, from tree topologies. Bayesian-factor analyses revealed strong support for the unconstrained tree instead of alternative trees in which monophyly of the two genera was forced. Thus, the present molecular phylogeny does not support the separation of the species within this complex into the genera Mithrax and Mithraculus. A review of the literature demonstrated considerable phenotypic variation within monophyletic clades in this group. © Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom 2009.","The Casiquiare River is a unique biogeographic corridor between the Orinoco and Amazonas basins. We investigated the importance of this connection for Neotropical fishes using peacock cichlids (Cichla spp.) as a model system. We tested whether the Casiquiare provides a conduit for gene flow between contemporary populations, and investigated the origin of biogeographic distributions that span the Casiquiare. Using sequences from the mitochondrial control region of three focal species (C. temensis, C. monoculus, and C. orinocensis) whose distributions include the Amazonas, Orinoco, and Casiquiare, we constructed maximum likelihood phylograms of haplotypes and analyzed the populations under an isolation-with-migration coalescent model. Our analyses suggest that populations of all three species have experienced some degree of gene flow via the Casiquiare. We also generated a mitochondrial genealogy of all Cichla species using >2000 bp and performed a dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA) to reconstruct the historical biogeography of the genus. This analysis, when combined with the intraspecific results, supports two instances of dispersal from the Amazonas to the Orinoco. Thus, our results support the idea that the Casiquiare connection is important across temporal scales, facilitating both gene flow and the dispersal and range expansion of species. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","There are various approaches for quantitative estimation of reservoir properties from seismic inversion. A general Bayesian formulation for the inverse problem can be implemented in two different work flows. In the sequential approach, first seismic data are inverted, deterministically or stochastically, into elastic properties; then rock-physics models transform those elastic properties to the reservoir property of interest. The joint or simultaneous work flow accounts for the elastic parameters and the reservoir properties, often in a Bayesian formulation, guaranteeing consistency between the elastic and reservoir properties. Rock physics plays the important role of linking elastic parameters such as impedances and velocities to reservoir properties of interest such as lithologies, porosity, and pore fluids. Geostatistical methods help add constraints of spatial correlation, conditioning to different kinds of data and incorporating subseismic scales of heterogeneities. © 2010 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.","Background: The subtype diversity of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes is unknown in Venezuela. Methodology/Principal Findings: Partial sequencing of the NS5B region was performed in 310 isolates circulating in patients from 1995 to 2007. In the samples collected between 2005 and 2007, HCV genotype 1 (G1) was the most common genotype (63%), composed as expected of mainly G1a and G1b. G2 was the second most common genotype (33%), being G2a almost absent and G2j the most frequent subtype. Sequence analysis of the core region confirmed the subtype assignment performed within the NS5b region in 63 isolates. The complete genome sequence of G2j was obtained. G2j has been described in France, Canada and Burkina Fasso, but it was not found in Martinique, where several subtypes of G2 circulate in the general population. Bayesian coalescence analysis indicated a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of G2j around 1785, before the introduction of G1b (1869) and G1a (1922). While HCV G1a and G1b experienced a growth reduction since 1990, coincident with the time when blood testing was implemented in Venezuela, HCV G2j did not seem to reach growth equilibrium during this period. Conclusions/Significance: Assuming the introduction of G2j from Africa during the slave trade, the high frequency of G2j found in Venezuela could suggest: 1- the introduction of African ethnic groups different from the ones introduced to Martinique or 2- the occurrence of a founder effect. This study represents an in-depth analysis of the subtype diversity of HCV in Venezuela, which is still unexplored in the Americas and deserves further studies. © 2010 Sulbaran et al.","This work determines the molecular epidemiology of dengue virus in Venezuela by means of phylogenetic calculations performed on the EELA-2 Grid infrastructure with the PhyloGrid application, an open source tool that allows users performing phylogeny reconstruction in their research.

We developed Bayesian equations, which modify the virtual layer sampling method proposed by Liu, Harder, and Berne (LHB). Additionally, we obtained an analytical solution for the corresponding nonhomogeneous Langevin equation. The expressions found for the mean-squared displacement in the layers contain naturally a modification due to the mean force in the transverse component in terms of the anisotropic diffusion constants and mean exit time. Instead of running a time consuming dual MD-Langevin simulation dynamics, as proposed by LHB, our expression was used to fit the MD data in the entire survival time interval not only for the parallel but also for the perpendicular direction. The only fitting parameter was the diffusion constant in each layer. © 2009 The American Physical Society.","We present a new method, based on the method of maximum entropy in the mean, which builds upon the standard method of maximum entropy, to improve the parametric estimation of a decay rate when the measurements are corrupted by large level of noise and, more importantly, when the number of measurements is small. The method is developed in the context on a concrete example: that of estimation of the parameter in an exponential distribution. We show how to obtain an estimator with the noise filtered out, and using simulated data, we compare the performance of our method with the Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. © 2009 H.

We find that these limit distributions belong to the domain of attraction of the Fréchet family when the parent distribution of the daily values is a TPT t-Student model. In this case, the shape parameter of the limiting GEV model depends on the degrees of freedom and the power transformation parameter. When the parent distribution of the daily values is a TPT Normal model, the limiting GEV model is independent of the parameters of the parent model. We perform a detailed inference and predictive analysis to verify these theoretical results using a Bayesian approach. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) were used to estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters of the t-Student model for daily rainfall on one hand, and to estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters of the GEV model for the annual maxima on the other hand. Numerical results are presented for two locations: Maiquetía (Vargas State), and La Mariposa (Miranda State), Venezuela. Simulations from the predictive distribution of the daily values suggest a good approximation between the extreme distribution of the TPT t-Student model and the Fréchet model found by standard extreme value limit theory. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","The optimal design of complex systems in engineering requires the availability of mathematical models of system's behavior as a function of a set of design variables; such models allow the designer to find the best solution to the design problem. However, system models (e.g. CFD analysis, physical prototypes) are usually time-consuming and expensive to evaluate, and thus unsuited for systematic use during design. Approximate models, or metamodels, of system behavior based on a limited set of data allow significant savings by reducing the resources devoted to modeling during the design process. In our work in engineering design based on multiple performance criteria, we propose the use of Multi-response Bayesian Surrogate Models (MRBSM) to model several aspects of system behavior jointly, instead of modeling each individually. By doing so, it is expected that the observed correlation among the response variables can be used to achieve better models with smaller data sets. In this work, we study the approximation capabilities of several covariance functions needed for multi-response metamodeling with MRBSM, performing a simulation study in which we compare MRBSM based on different covariance functions against metamodels built individually for each response. Our preliminary results indicate that MRBSM outperforms individual metamodels in 46% to 67% of the test cases, though the relative performance of the studied covariance functions is highly dependent on the sampling scheme used and the actual correlation among the observed response values.

In this paper we present an interdisciplinary work based on an ambulatory blood pressure study and the development of a new classification algorithm named REMED. We focused on the discovery of new patterns for abnormal blood pressure variability as a possible cardiovascular risk factor. We compared our results with other classification algorithms based on Bayesian methods, decision trees, and rule induction techniques. In the comparison, REMED showed similar accuracy to these algorithms but it has the advantage of being superior in its capacity to classify sick people correctly. Therefore, our method could represent an innovative approach that might be useful in medical decision support for cardiovascular disease prognosis. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","The use of a Bayesian regularization algorithm is proposed for calibration in near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) with linear models.

The taxonomic status of one of the best studied Paracoccidioides isolates (Pb01) as P. brasiliensis remains unresolved due to its genomic differences from the other three previously described phylogenetic species (S1, PS2 and PS3; Carrero et al., 2008. Fungal Genet. Biol. 45, 605). Using the genealogic concordance method of phylogenetic species recognition (GCPSR) via maximum parsimony and Bayesian analysis, we identified a clade of 17 genotypically similar isolates, including Pb01, which are distinct from the S1/PS2/P3 clade. Consistent with GCPSR, this \"Pb01-like\" group can be considered a new phylogenetic species, since it is strongly supported by all independent and concatenated genealogies. \"Pb01-like\" species exhibit great sequence and morphological divergence from the S1/PS2/PS3 species clade, and we estimate that these groups last shared a common ancestor approximately 32 million years ago. In addition, recombination analysis revealed independent events inside both main groups suggesting reproductive isolation. Consequently, we recommend the formal description of the \"Pb01-like\" cluster as the new species Paracoccidioides lutzii, a tribute to Adolpho Lutz, discoverer of P. brasiliensis in 1908. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.","Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. subsp. arundinacea) is one of the most economically important forage grasses in cold and temperate regions of the world. In this study, we have assessed the genetic diversity and structure of wild Iranian tall fescue populations. Thirty-seven individuals from nine natural populations from northern, western, and southern Iranian mountain ranges were analyzed using six genomic-SSRs and five EST-SSRs primer pairs. Our analysis has demonstrated that transcribed EST-SSR regions showed levels of polymorphism similar to genomic-SSR regions. UPGMA, repeated bisection, and model-based Bayesian STRUCTURE clustering methods coupled with neighbornet network were used to establish six divergent groups of individuals. FST estimates among clusters showed moderate to low genetic structure. Within-group genetic diversity estimate H and partial correlations between genetic and geographic distances among populations suggested that western Zagros population was related to the rest of the Iranian individuals. The isolation-by-distance hypothesis was not supported by SSR data and the present geographical sampling. © Springer-Verlag 2009.","We used partial sequences of mitochondrial 16S and cytochrome oxidase I genes to perform a phylogenetic study of collared frogs (Anura: Aromobatidae: Mannophryne), a genus endemic to Venezuela and the islands of Trinidad and Tobago. We analysed 1.2 kb from 13 of the 15 described species of Mannophryne. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses support the monophyly of Mannophryne. Mannophryne consists of three deeply differentiated clades that split from each other in a relatively short period of time. The diversification of Mannophryne occurred well before the glacial-interglacial periods of the Quaternary. Our data support the taxonomic validity of M. olmonae, a species endemic to Tobago Island. Mannophryne olmonae is more closely related to the continental species Mannophryne riveroi than to the Trinidad island endemic Mannophryne trinitatis. As in most tropical clades of frogs, molecular evidence indicates that species richness in Mannophryne is largely underestimated and, consequently, current priorities for conservation are inadequate. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London.","This paper aims to provide a practical example of assessment and propagation of input uncertainty for option pricing when using tree-based methods. Input uncertainty is propagated into output uncertainty, reflecting that option prices are as unknown as the inputs they are based on. Option pricing formulas are tools whose validity is conditional not only on how close the model represents reality, but also on the quality of the inputs they use, and those inputs are usually not observable. We show three different approaches to integrating out the model nuisance parameters and show how this translates into model uncertainty in the tree model space for the theoretical option prices. We compare our method with classical calibration-based results assuming that there is no options market established and no statistical model linking inputs and outputs. These methods can be applied to pricing of instruments for which there is no options market, as well as a methodological tool to account for parameter and model uncertainty in theoretical option pricing.

The gating of BK channels and its modulation by Ca2+ and voltage has been the subject of intensive research over almost three decades, yielding several of the most complicated kinetic mechanisms ever proposed. A large number of open and closed states disposed, respectively, in two planes, named tiers, characterize these mechanisms. Transitions between states in the same plane are cooperative and modulated by Ca2+. Transitions across planes are highly concerted and voltage-dependent. Here we reexamine the validity of the two-tiered hypothesis by restricting attention to the modulation by Ca 2+. Large single channel data sets at five Ca2+ concentrations were simultaneously analyzed from a Bayesian perspective by using hidden Markov models and Markov-chain Monte Carlo stochastic integration techniques. Our results support a dramatic reduction in model complexity, favoring a simple mechanism derived from the Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric model for homotetramers, able to explain the Ca2+ modulation of the gating process. This model differs from the standard Monod-Wyman-Changeux scheme in that one distinguishes when two Ca2+ ions are bound to adjacent or diagonal subunits of the tetramer. © 2009 by the Biophysical Society.","Hydrocarbon reservoirs are characterized by seismic, well-log, and petrophysical information, which is dissimilar in spatial distribution, scale, and relationship to reservoir properties. We combine this diverse information in a unified inverse-problem formulation using a multiproperty, multiscale model, linking properties statistically by petrophysical relationships and conditioning them to well-log data. Two approaches help us: (1) Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling, which generates many reservoir realizations for estimating medium properties and posterior marginal probabilities, and (2) optimization with a least-squares iterative technique to obtain the most probable model configuration. Our petrophysical model, applied to near-vertical-anglestackedseismic data and well-log data from a gas reservoir, includes a deterministic component, based on a combination of Wyllie and Wood relationships calibrated with the well-log data, and a random component, based on the statistical characterization of the deviations of well-log data from the petrophysical transform. At the petrophysical level, the effects of porosity and saturation on acoustic impedance are coupled; conditioning the inversion to well-log data helps resolve this ambiguity. The combination of well logs, petrophysics, and seismic inversion builds on the corresponding strengths of each type of information, jointly improving (1) cross resolution of reservoir properties, (2) vertical resolution of property fields, (3) compliance to the smooth trend of property fields, and (4) agreement with well-log data at well positions. © 2009 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

However, most statistical models available in the literature assume some kind of parametric form (clearly neglecting important characteristics of the data) or focus on modeling extreme events (therefore, providing no information about the rest of the distribution). In this paper we develop a Bayesian nonparametric prior for a collection of distributions evolving in discrete time. The prior is constructed by defining the distribution at any time point as a Dirichlet process mixture of Gaussian distributions, and inducing dependence through the atoms of their stick-breaking decomposition. A general construction, which allows for trends, periodicities and regressors is described. The resulting model is applied to the estimation of the time-varying travel expense distribution of employees from a major development bank comparable to the IDB, IMF and World Bank. © 2008 International Society for Bayesian Analysis.","In this paper, we describe a general method for constructing the posterior distribution of the mean and volatility of the return of an asset satisfying dS = S dX for some simple models of X. Our framework takes as inputs the prior distributions of the parameters of the stochastic process followed by the underlying, as well as the likelihood function implied by the observed price history for the underlying. As an application of our framework, we compute the value at risk (VaR) and conditional VaR (CVaR) measures for the changes in the price of an option implied by the posterior distribution of the volatility of the underlying. The implied VaR and CVaR are more conservative than their classical counterpart, since it takes into account the estimation risk that arises due to parameter uncertainty.

These beetles are morphologically highly distinct and at a body length of 0.8 mm represent the perhaps smallest individuals of Adephaga. Here, we use DNA sequence data to place this enigmatic taxon relative to other aquatic groups in this suborder. Meruidae was most closely associated with Noteridae, supporting a previous analysis of morphological structures which had suggested this sister relationship, albeit with weak support. While different alignment strategies did not affect the topology, the precise placement of Meruidae was affected by the choice of tree reconstruction method. Bayesian inference suggests a sister relationship of Meruidae + Noteridae, while parsimony analyses retrieve Meruidae + Notomicrus (a basal noterid genus), which combined are the sister group of all remaining Noteridae. Considering morphological evidence, the former placement appears more plausible. © 2008 The Authors.","This paper analyzes data from 113 Venezuelan monthly precipitation stations for recent years. The data come from the climatic network from the Venezuelan Guayana Coorporation- Caroni Electrification (CVG-EDELCA), the Venezuelan Air Force (FAV), and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN). An homogeneity test is carried out by using Alexandersson's test (Alexandersson 1986) to detect locations with important changes in the mean, which are not part of the natural climate variability. Linear models with a trend component, a seasonal component and autoregressive errors are fitted by using Generalized Least Squares. Different models are compared to determine whether the trend component should be included within the model, as well as the seasonal component with one or two harmonics, depending on whether the precipitation presents a single or two modes along the year. The Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) is used for model selection. The estimated trend values and the significance of the trend component are spatially represented. It is found that in the northern coastal region and most of the Andean region precipitation trends are negative. On the contrary, southeast of Bolívar state presents a positive trend. However, the model trend component is not significant for most locations. Moreover, the seasonal pattern is best represented with a model with two harmonics, given the seasonal characteristics of the analyzed locations.","The authors consider a class of models for spatio-temporal processes based on convolving independent processes with a discrete kernel that is represented by a lower triangular matrix. They study two families of models. In the first one, spatial Gaussian processes with isotropic correlations are convoluted with a kernel that provides temporal dependencies. In the second family, AR(p) processes are convoluted with a kernel providing spatial interactions. The covariance structures associated with these two families are quite rich. Their covariance functions that are stationary and separable in space and time as well as time dependent nonseparable and nonisotropic ones.","In this work we re-examine some classical bounds for non negative integer-valued random variables by means of information theoretic or maxentropic techniques using fractional moments as constraints. The proposed new bound, no more analytically expressible in terms of moments or moment generating function (mgf), is built by mixing classical bounds and the Maximum Entropy (ME) approximant of the underlying distribution; such a new bound is able to exploit optimally all the information content provided by the sequence of given moments or by the mgf. Particular care will be devoted to obtain fractional moments from the available information given in terms of integer moments and/or moment generating function. Numerical examples show clearly that the bound improvement involving the ME approximant based on fractional moments is not trivial.","The phylogenetic relationships among representatives of 64 genera of the cosmopolitan parasitic wasps of the subfamily Doryctinae were investigated based on nuclear 28S ribosomal (r) DNA (∼650 bp of the D2-3 region) and cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) mitochondrial (mt) DNA (603 bp) sequence data. The molecular dating of selected clades and the biogeography of the subfamily were also inferred. The partitioned Bayesian analyses did not recover a monophyletic Doryctinae, though the relationships involved were only weakly supported. Strong evidence was found for rejecting the monophylies of both Doryctes Haliday, 1836 and Spathius Nees, 1818. Our results also support the recognition of the Rhaconotini as a valid tribe. A dispersal-vicariance analysis showed a strong geographical signal for the taxa included, with molecular dating estimates for the origin of Doryctinae and its subsequent radiation both occurring during the late Paleocene-early Eocene. The divergence time estimates suggest that diversification in the subfamily could have in part occurred as a result of continental break-up events that took place in the southern hemisphere, though more recent dispersal events account for the current distribution of several widespread taxa. © CSIRO 2008.","The Teide-Pico Viejo volcanic complex situated in Tenerife Island (Canary Islands, Spain) has recently shown signs of unrest, long after its last eruptive episode at Chinyero in 1909, and the last explosive episode which happened at Montaña Blanca, 2000 years ago. In this paper we study the seismicity of the Teide-Pico Viejo complex recorded between May and December 2004, in order to show the applicability of tools such as Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian Belief Networks which can be used to build a structure for evaluating the probability of given eruptive or volcano-related scenarios. The results support the existence of a bidirectional relationship between volcano-tectonic events and the background seismic noise - in particular its frequency content. This in turn suggests that the two phenomena can be related to one unique process influencing their generation. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The genus Sotalia (coastal and riverine South American dolphins) is currently considered a member of the Stenoninae subfamily, along with the genera Steno (rough toothed dolphin) and Sousa (humpbacked dolphin). In recent years, a revision of this classification was proposed based on phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b, wherein Sousa was included in the Delphininae subfamily, keeping only Steno and Sotalia as members of the Stenoninae subfamily. Here we investigate the phylogenetic placement of Sotalia using two mitochondrial genes, six autosomal introns and four Y chromosome introns, providing a total of 5,196 base pairs (bp) for each taxon in the combined dataset. Sequences from these genomic regions were obtained for 17 delphinid species, including at least one species from each of five or six currently recognized subfamilies plus five odontocete outgroup species. Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of independent (each fragment) and combined datasets (mtDNA, nuDNA or mtDNA+nuDNA) showed that Sotalia and Sousa fall within a clade containing other members of Delphininae, exclusive of Steno. Sousa was resolved as the sister taxon to Sotalia according to analysis of the nuDNA dataset but not analysis of the mtDNA or combined mtDNA+nuDNA datasets. Based on the results from our multi-locus analysis, we offer several novel changes to the classification of Delphinidae, some of which are supported by previous morphological and molecular studies. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The observed data are the seismic amplitudes in time for different source-receiver offsets. For the simulation of the seismic data we convolve a source wavelet with the reflectivity series obtained with ray tracing and the exact solution of the Zoeppritz equations; we also include in the inversion scheme prior information of the statistics of the elastic medium parameters. We invert the seismic data using a sampling Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique that generates a long chain of the stratified model realizations, all probable in terms of the geophysical and prior statistical information, and convergent to the posterior probability density. In this technique we combine the Gibbs and the Metropolis algorithms. We validate the method with numerical tests, using elastic models simulated on the basis of the statistics of real well-logged data, including mean property values, standard deviations and correlation across the elastic properties. With this method we produce a complete description of the uncertainties of the model parameters.","The braconid wasp subfamily Doryctinae mainly comprises idiobiont ectoparasitoids of other insect larvae.

Because of their considerable morphological differences, these gall-associated taxa traditionally have been placed in separate tribes or even in other subfamilies. In this study, we investigate the phylogenetic relationships among representatives of a number of different doryctine genera, including five of its seven gall-associated genera using two genetic markers. Here we analyzed the length-variable 28S sequence data based on secondary structure both excising the unalignable regions and recoding them according to indel length. In addition, multiple alignments were carried out with a range of gap-opening and extension parameters. The combined (28S + CO1) phylogenetic hypotheses obtained, both excluding and recoding the unalignable regions, recover a clade comprising the five gall-associated genera, and most of the analyses using multiple alignments also support this relationship. These results support a scenario in which secondary phytophagy evolves from initially attacking primary gall-forming hosts. The relationships recovered are also more congruent with a model that explains the macroevolution of insect plant association in the Doryctinae as reflecting geographic proximity rather than host plant relationships. Further, our phylogenetic hypotheses consistently show that one of the main morphological features employed in the higher level classification of the Doryctinae is actually highly homoplastic. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We propose a Bayesian criteria for acceptance/rejection of configurations, in terms of the variations of the functional. The loss function and variational functional minimization approaches are compared.","We propose a new hybrid approach to compute unbiased permeability estimates in uncored wells using the theory of Hydraulic Flow Units (HFU) based on the Carman-Kozeny equation. First, a linear regression scheme is applied to obtain the optimal number of HFU present in core data. Next, the results obtained are used as input for the nonlinear optimization scheme based on the probability plot from which statistical parameters of each population are obtained. Subsequently, Bayes' rule is applied for clustering core data into its respective HFU. Finally, an algorithm based on Bayesian inference is applied to predict permeability in uncored wells. The methodology is applied to a Venezuelan sandstone reservoir and to a Middle East sandstone reservoir. Application of the methodology allows permeability prediction in cored wells with correlation coefficients above 0.95 for the field cases under analysis. Permeability profiles in uncored wells compare well with pressure transient test results. Among primary applications are better productivity index assessments, enhanced petrophysical evaluations, and improved reservoir simulation models. Coupling of Nonlinear optimization with Bayesian inference proves a robust way for performing data clustering providing unbiased estimations. ©2007.","In order to reduce the time and resources devoted to design-space exploration during simulation-based design and optimization, the use of surrogate models, or metamodels, has been proposed in the literature. Key to the success of metamodeling efforts are the experimental design techniques used to generate the combinations of input variables at which the computer experiments are conducted. Several adaptive sampling techniques have been proposed to tailor the experimental designs to the specific application at hand, using the already-acquired data to guide further exploration of the input space, instead of using a fixed sampling scheme defined a priori. Though mixed results have been reported, it has been argued that adaptive sampling techniques can be more efficient, yielding better surrogate models with less sampling points. In this paper, we address the problem of adaptive sampling for single and multi-response metamodels, with a focus on Multi-stage Multi-response Bayesian Surrogate Models (MMBSM). We compare distance-optimal latin hypercube sampling, an entropy-based criterion and the maximum cross-validation variance criterion, originally proposed for one-dimensional output spaces and implemented in this paper for multi-dimensional output spaces. Our results indicate that, both for single and multi-response surrogate models, the entropy-based adaptive sampling approach leads to models that are more robust to the initial experimental design and at least as accurate (or better) when compared with other sampling techniques using the same number of sampling points.

In this paper, we focus on corrective protection proposing an anomaly IDS model for Manet. The design and development of the IDS are considered in our 3 main stages: normal behavior construction, anomaly detection and model update. A parametrical mixture model is used for behavior modeling from reference data. The associated Bayesian classification leads to the detection algorithm.

This species is considered to be clonal according to mycological criteria and has been shown to vary in virulence. To characterize natural genetic variation and reproductive mode in this fungus, we analyzed P. brasiliensis phylogenetically in search of cryptic species and possible recombination using concordance and nondiscordance of gene genealogies with respect to phylogenies of eight regions in five nuclear loci. Our data indicate that this fungus consists of at least three distinct, previously unrecognized species: S1 (species 1 with 38 isolates), PS2 (phylogenetic species 2 with six isolates), and PS3 (phylogenetic species 3 with 21 isolates). Genealogies of four of the regions studied strongly supported the PS2 clade, composed of five Brazilian and one Venezuelan isolate. The second clade, PS3, composed solely of 21 Colombian isolates, was strongly supported by the α-tubulin genealogy. The remaining 38 individuals formed S1. Two of the three lineages of P. brasiliensis, S1 and PS2, are sympatric across their range, suggesting barriers to gene flow other than geographic isolation. Our study provides the first evidence for possible sexual reproduction in P. brasiliensis S1, but does not rule it out in the other two species. © The Author 2005.

According to MPC approach, at each sampling time, the controller is calculated by minimizing an upper bound of a quadratic cost function over infinite time horizon. The optimization problem and the associated constraints on the input and output process are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI). From the input-output representation, an extended state space model is constructed, where the state is composed of present and past values of the system's inputs and outputs. The control is obtained as a function of known output and input signals, hence there is no need for any estimate of the unmeasured states, as it would be necessary in the \"traditional\" state space modelization. The proposed algorithm is illustrated on numerical examples. © 2005 IEEE.","Montane areas in the Neotropics are characterized by high diversity and endemism of birds and other groups. The avian genus Myioborus (Parulinae) is a group of insectivorous warblers, characteristic of cloud forests, that represents one of the few Parulinae genera (New World warblers) that has radiated substantially in South America. The genus is distributed throughout most montane regions from the southwestern United States to northern Argentina. Here, I use mitochondrial sequences from the cytochrome b, ND2, and ND3 genes to present the first hypothesis of phylogenetic relationship among all Myioborus species level taxa. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods produced similar results and suggest a northern origin for the genus Myioborus with subsequent colonization of the Neotropical Montane Region. The lower-montane species, M. miniatus, is the sister taxon to a clade in which all taxa occupy upper-montane habitats. These \"highland\" taxa diverged early in the history of the genus and produced two well-defined monophyletic lineages, a Central-northern Andean clade formed by M. albifrons, M. ornatus, and M. melanocephalus, and a Pantepui (table-mountains of southern Venezuela, northern Brazil, and western Guyana) clade consisting of M. castaneocapillus, M. albifacies, and M. cardonai, and probably M. pariae. M. brunniceps, M. flavivertex, and M. torquatus were included in this upper-montane clade but without clear relationships to other taxa. Lack of resolution of nodes defining the upper-montane species clade is likely to result from a period of rapid diversification mediated by geological and climatic events during the Late Pliocene. These results suggest that an interplay of dispersal and vicariance has shaped the current biogeographic patterns of Myioborus.","In this work we present a Bayesian analysis in linear regression models with spatially varying coefficients for modeling and inference in spatio-temporal processes. This kind of model is particularly appealing in situations where the effect of one or more explanatory processes on the response present substantial spatial heterogeneity. We describe for this model how to make inference about the regression coefficients and response processes under two scenarios: when the explanatory processes are known throughout the study region, and when they are known only at the sampling locations. Using a simulation experiment we investigate how parameter inference and interpolation performance are affected by some features of the data and prior distribution that is used. The proposed methodology is used to model the dataset on PM10 levels in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro presented in Paez and Gamerman (2003). © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.","We present Very Small Array (VSA) observations (centred on ≈34 GHz) on scales ≈20 arcmin towards a complete, X-ray flux-limited sample of seven clusters at redshift z < 0.1. Four of the clusters have significant Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) detections in the presence of cosmic microwave background (CMB) primordial anisotropy. For all seven, we use a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for inference from the VSA data, with X-ray priors on cluster positions and temperatures, and radio priors on sources. In this context, the CMB primordial fluctuations are an additional source of Gaussian noise, and are included in the model as a non-diagonal covariance matrix derived from the known angular power spectrum. In addition, we make assumptions of β-model gas distributions and of hydrostatic equilibrium, to evaluate probability densities for the gas mass (Mgas) and total mass (Mr) out to r200, the radius at which the average density enclosed is 200 times the critical density at the redshift of the cluster. This is further than has been done before and close to the classical value for a collapsed cluster. Our combined estimate of the gas fraction (f gas = Mgas/Mr) is 0.08-0.04 +0.06h-1. The random errors are poor (note, however, that the errors are higher than would have been obtained with the usual χ 2 method on the same data) but the control of bias is good. We have described the MCMC analysis method specifically in terms of SZ but hope the description will be of more general use. We find that the effects of primordial CMB contamination tend to be similar in the estimates of both Mgas and Mr over the narrow range of angular scales we are dealing with, so that there is little effect of primordials fgas determination. Using our Mr estimates we find a normalization of the mass-temperature relation based on the profiles from the VSA cluster pressure maps, which is in good agreement with recent M-T determinations from X-ray cluster measurements. © 2005 RAS.","Reduced adrenal 11β-hydroxylation has been associated with an aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) polymorphism. The 11β-hydroxylase gene (CYP11B1) lies close to CYP11B2. We hypothesize that a molecular variant in CYP11B2 is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a key quantitative trait in CYP11B1 determining this phenotype. Polymorphisms and inferred haplotypes at CYP11B loci were studied in two independent populations from Europe (n = 100) and South America (n = 99). The latter underwent detailed hormonal studies. LD was estimated by alternative Bayesian methods for inferring the extent of LD when haplotypes at different loci are inferred. Population differences in single nucleotide polymorphisms were modest, indicating the stability of both genes across populations. Using five of nine potentially informative loci at CYP11B sites with allele frequency greater than 0.1, two major contrasting haplotypes, CwtCG and TconvGTA, were found. In both populations the CwtCG haplotype accounted for 44% and the TconvGTA for 32% of subjects. Haplotype distribution did not differ between Europeans and South Americans (χ2 = 2.81; P = 0.09). In vivo 11β-hydroxylase activity, estimated from urinary steroid profiling, was lower in subjects with an increased aldosterone to renin ratio or with the TconvGTA haplotype. These findings indicate that genotypes at the CYP11B locus are in strong LD and that identified haplotypes predict 11β-hydroxylase activity.","Joint estimation of deformation and blurring parameters from spatial observations is considered. The generalized random field approach to the problem introduced in this paper provides a suitable framework for a technical treatment of these effects in relation to singularity properties of the fields. A mixture of Kullback-Leibler divergence loss functions is formulated in a Bayesian context. Simulations are developed to illustrate the performance of the approach proposed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.","This paper proposes a new segmentation method for the echocardiogaphic images based on data fusion theory. This proposal consists on a data fusion system with two inputs: The \"A\" input corresponds to the gradient image after having made the pre-processing links to the acquisition, filtering and interpolation. The \"B\" input corresponds a parametric equation of a priori model whose equation can be an ellipsoid or a superquadrics. These two inputs are fusion together by using the Bayesian methodology of probabilities with the purpose to obtain a new function \"F\". That will be used to stop the Level Set Method to segment the inside of the internal wall of the Left Ventricle (LV). Finally the 3D visualization of the LV volume is obtained using the method of marching cubes, and the 3D global model is adjusted to the previous reconstruction. The analysis of the Mean Square Error (MSE) between the calculated model and the real LV volume is smaller than 5%, which confirms the precision of computing of the global medical parameters. In conclusion, the segmentation method based on data fusion allows to obtain simultaneously the global model and the local model of deformation. © 2004 IEEE.","We consider decision problems defined by a utility function and an underlying probability model for all unknowns. The utility function quantifies the decision maker's preferences over consequences. The optimal decision maximizes the expected utility function where the expectation is taken with respect to all unknowns, that is, future data and parameters. In many problems, the solution is not analytically tractable. For example, the utility function might involve moments that can be computed only by numerical integration or simulation. Also, the nature of the decision space (i.e., the set of all possible actions) might have a shape or dimension that complicates the maximization. The motivating application for this discussion is the choice of a monitoring network when the optimization is performed over the high-dimensional set of all possible locations of monitoring stations, possibly including choice of the number of locations. We propose an approach to optimal Bayesian design based on inhomogeneous Markov chain simulation. We define a chain such that the limiting distribution identifies the optimal solution. The approach is closely related to simulated annealing. Standard simulated annealing algorithms assume that the target function can be evaluated for any given choice of the variable with respect to which we wish to optimize. For optimal design problems the target function (i.e., expected utility) is in general not available for efficient evaluation and might require numerical integration. We overcome the problem by defining an inhomogeneous Markov chain on an appropriately augmented space. The proposed inhomogeneous Markov chain Monte Carlo method addresses within one simulation both problems, evaluation of the expected utility and maximization.","This paper is concerned with the statistical analysis of single ion channel records. Single channels are modelled by using hidden Markov models and a combination of Bayesian statistics and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The techniques presented here provide a straightforward generalization to those in Rosales et al. (2001, Biophys. J., 80, 1088-1103), allowing to consider constraints imposed by a gating mechanism such as the aggregation of states into classes. This paper also presents an extension that allows to consider correlated background noise and filtered data, extending the scope of the analysis toward real experimental conditions. The methods described here are based on a solid probabilistic basis and are less computationally intensive than alternative Bayesian treatments or frequentist approaches that consider correlated data. © 2003 Society for Mathematical Biology.

The model is based on a time-varying regression of the observed readings on air temperature. Such a regression requires interpolated values of temperature at locations and times where readings are not available. These are obtained from a time-varying spatiotemporal model that is coupled to the model for the ozone readings. Two location-dependent harmonic components are added to account for the main periodicities that ozone presents during a given day and that are not explained through the covariate. The model incorporates spatial covariance structure for the observations and the parameters that define the harmonic components. Using the dynamic linear model framework, we show how to compute smoothed means and predictive values for ozone. We illustrate the methodology on data from September 1997.","Type-II ryanodine receptor channels (RYRs) playa fundamental role in intracellular Ca2+ dynamics in heart. The processes of activation, inactivation, and regulation of these channels have been the subject of intensive research and the focus of recent debates. Typically, approaches to understand these processes involve statistical analysis of single RYRs, involving signal restoration, model estimation, and selection. These tasks are usually performed by following rather phenomenological criteria that turn models into self-fulfilling prophecies. Here, a thorough statistical treatment is applied by modeling single RYRs using aggregated hidden Markov models. Inferences are made using Bayesian statistics and stochastic search methods known as Markov chain Monte Carlo. These methods allow extension of the temporal resolution of the analysis far beyond the limits of previous approaches and provide a direct measure of the uncertainties associated with every estimation step, together with a direct assessment of why and where a particular model fails. Analyses of single RYRs at several Ca2+ concentrations are made by considering 16 models, some of them previously reported in the literature. Results clearly show that single RYRs have Ca 2+-dependent gating modes. Moreover, our results demonstrate that single RYRs responding to a sudden change in Ca2+ display adaptation kinetics. Interestingly, best ranked models predict microscopic reversibility when monovalent cations are used as the main permeating species. Finally, the extended bandwidth revealed the existence of novel fast buzz-mode at low Ca 2+ concentrations.","A phylogenetic study of Vulpia, fine-leaved Festuca (Festuca subg. Festuca p.p.), and other related genera of the tribe Poeae (Poaceae) has been conducted using both separate and combined analyses of DNA sequences from the nuclear ITS region and the chloroplast trnL-F region. All five sections of Vulpia (sects. Vulpia, Monachne, Spirachne, Loretia, Apalochloa) and three sections and one subsection of fine-leaved Festuca (sects. Eskia, Festuca, Aulaxyper, subsect. Exaratae) were included in the analysis. Six minor annual genera that have been considered in the past to be related either to Vulpia or to these fescues (Psilurus, Ctenopsis, Cutandia, Narduroides, Micropyrum, Wangenheimia) were also analyzed in order to estimate an evolutionary framework for this poorly known group of ephemeral or thin-leaved grasses. Single representatives of other less related groups of Poeae (Festuca subg. Schedonorus and Drymanthele, Lolium, Dactylis, Poa, Puccinellia, Sesleria), Triticeae (Secale), and Brachypodieae (Brachypodium) were also studied. Phylogenetic analyses were performed based on parsimony and Bayesian inference criteria using Brachypodium distachyon as outgroup. Our results indicate that Vulpia and the fine-leaved Festuca are, respectively, polyphyletic and paraphyletic assemblages of several taxa. A well-supported monophyletic group that encompasses the fine-leaved Festuca and Vulpia lineages as well as the other six ephemeral genera (FEVRE) has been obtained from both the separate and the combined ITS and trnL-F analyses. Within this FEVRE clade Festuca sect. Eskia is shown to be a paraphyletic assemblage basal to the other taxa; the core of the FEVRE clade contains four supported clades representing, respectively, the lineages Aulaxyper + Vulpia pro parte (diploid), Festuca + Wangenheimia, Psilurus + Vulpia pro parte (polyploid), and Spirachne + Monachne + Loretia. Vulpia unilateralis (Apalochloa) constitutes a monospecific lineage with apparent but unsupported affinities to some of its potential closer relatives. Representatives of all the Vulpia sections except those belonging to typical section Vulpia join in a paraphyletic poorly supported assemblage that also includes Cutandia, Festuca plicata, and Ctenopsis. Two of the studied annual genera, Micropyrum and Narduroides, show distant evolutionary placements in the ITS and trnL-F trees. The Festuca subsect. Exaratae taxa belong to a phylogenetic lineage diverging from those of the Festuca ovina (sect. Festuca) and F. rubra (sect. Aulaxyper) fescues. Nucleotide substitution rates show significant differences between most perennial and annual lineages; stabilized selection is maintained in the slowly diverging perennial groups, whereas the rapid adaptive evolutionary processes shown by the annual taxa may have resulted in an increased rate in cladogenesis. The Mediterranean region is hypothesized as the likely place of divergence of these grass lineages.","Analyses of ribosomal ITS and chloroplast trnL-F sequences provide phylogenetic reconstruction for the festucoids (Poeae: Loliinae), a group of temperate grasses with morphological and molecular affinities to the large genus Festuca. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses of the combined ITS/trnL-F dataset show Loliinae to be monophyletic but unresolved for a weakly supported clade of 'broad-leaved Festuca,' a well-supported clade of 'fine-leaved Festuca,' and Castellia. The first group includes subgenera Schenodorus, Drymanthele, Leucopoa, and Subulatae, and sections Subbulbosae, Scariosa, and Pseudoscariosa of Festuca, plus Lolium and Micropyropsis. The second group includes sections Festuca, Aulaxyper, Eskia, and Amphigenes of Festuca, plus Vulpia, Ctenopsis, Psilurus, Wangenheimia, Cutandia, Narduroides, and Micropyrum. Subtribes Dactylidinae and Cynosurinae/Parapholiinae are sister clades and are the closest relatives of Loliinae. Vulpia is polyphyletic within the 'fine-leaved' fescues as revealed by the two genome analyses. Lolium is resolved as monophyletic in the ITS and combined analyses, but unresolved in the trnL-F based tree. Conflict between the ITS and the trnL-F trees in the placement of several taxa suggests the possibility of past reticulation events, although lineage sorting and possible ITS paralogy cannot be ruled out. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In many applications it will be preferable to work with multivariate spatial processes to specify such models. A critical specification in providing these models is the cross covariance function. Constructive approaches for developing valid cross-covariance functions offer the most practical strategy for doing this. These approaches include separability, kernel convolution or moving average methods, and convolution of covariance functions. We review these approaches but take as our main focus the computationally manageable class referred to as the linear model of coregionalization (LMC). We introduce a fully Bayesian development of the LMC. We offer clarification of the connection between joint and conditional approaches to fitting such models including prior specifications. However, to substantially enhance the usefulness of such modelling we propose the notion of a spatially varying LMC (SVLMC) providing a very rich class of multivariate nonstationary processes with simple interpretation. We illustrate the use of our proposed SVLMC with application to more than 600 commercial property transactions in three quite different real estate markets, Chicago, Dallas and San Diego. Bivariate nonstationary process models are developed for income from and selling price of the property.","The short answer is yes. Provided Extreme Value Theory is employed under a Bayesian approach to statistics. The conventional analysis based on the assumptions of a homogeneous population of annual maxima with a Gumbel distribution, with parameters estimated from the data and then \"plugged-in\" in the distribution to make predictions, yield that the rainfall observed on December 15, 1999, would be observed on average in 17 million years! Even worse, had we conducted a classical hypothesis test, prior to December 15, 1999, then the Gumbel test would not have been rejected. We instead model the data following a non-homogeneous seasonal Generalized Pareto Distribution under a Bayesian framework that explicitly takes into account the uncertainties about the parameter and models. For computation we use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computational methods. Central references to this article are: Coles and Pericchi (3) and Coles, Pericchi and Sisson (4).","We consider the problem of characterizing the lithology of a reservoir using gamma ray logs as well as seismic ces around the well. We first calculate the continuous-wavelet transform of the the data and then use the fact that the energy of such transformation is proportional to a power of its scale. The technique consists in estimating the power transformation obtaining a set of values of the same size as the original data and then modeling the distribution of these values using a double exponential. We find that wells that are predominantly sand correspond to distributions that are significantly different from those that correspond to wells that are predominantly gravel. This happens in both cases: gamma rays and seismic traces. We use this characterization to classify other points in the reservoir.","The need for high resolution rainfall data at temporal scales varying from daily to hourly or even minutes is a very important problem in hydrology. For many locations of the world, rainfall data quality is very poor and reliable measurements are only available at a coarse time resolution such as monthly. The purpose of this work is to apply a stochastic disaggregation method of monthly to daily precipitation in two steps: 1. Initialization of the daily rainfall series by using the truncated normal model as a reference distribution. 2. Restructuring of the series according to various time series statistics (autocorrelation function, scaling properties, seasonality) by using a Markov chain Monte Carlo based algorithm. The method was applied to a data set from a rainfall network of the central plains of Venezuela, in where rainfall is highly seasonal and data availability at a daily time scale or even higher temporal resolution is very limited. A detailed analysis was carried out to study the seasonal and spatial variability of many properties of the daily rainfall as scaling properties and autocorrelation function in order to incorporate the selected statistics and their annual cycle into an objective function to be minimized in the simulation procedure. Comparisons between the observed and simulated data suggest the adequacy of the technique in providing rainfall sequences with consistent statistical properties at a daily time scale given the monthly totals. The methodology, although highly computationally intensive, needs a moderate number of statistical properties of the daily rainfall. Regionalization of these statistical properties is an important next step for the application of this technique to regions in where daily data is not available. © Springer-Verlag 2002.","This paper explores the usefulness of robust Bayesian analysis in the context of an applied problem, finding priors to model judicial neutrality in an age discrimination case. We seek large classes of prior distributions without trivial bounds on the posterior probability of a key set, that is, without bounds that are independent of the data. Such an exploration shows qualitatively where the prior elicitation matters most, and quantitatively how sensitive the conclusions are to specified prior changes. The novel non-parametric classes proposed and studied here represent judicial neutrality and are reasonably wide, so that when a clear conclusion emerges from the data at hand, this is arguably very reliable. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","We explore some aspects of the analysis of latent component structure in non-stationary time series based on time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) models that incorporate uncertainty on model order. Our modelling approach assumes that the AR coefficients evolve in time according to a random walk and that the model order may also change in time following a discrete random walk. In addition, we use a conjugate prior structure on the autoregressive coefficients and a discrete uniform prior on model order. Simulation from the posterior distribution of the model parameters can be obtained via standard forward filtering backward simulation algorithms. Aspects of implementation and inference on decompositions, latent structure and model order are discussed for a synthetic series and for an electroencephalogram (EEG) trace previously analysed using fixed order TVAR models.","Spatially varying phenomena are often modeled using Gaussian random fields, specified by their mean function and covariance function. The spatial correlation structure of these models is commonly specified to be of a certain form (e.g., spherical, power exponential, rational quadratic, or Matérn) with a small number of unknown parameters. We consider objective Bayesian analysis of such spatial models, when the mean function of the Gaussian random field is specified as in a linear model. It is thus necessary to determine an objective (or default) prior distribution for the unknown mean and covariance parameters of the random field. We first show that common choices of default prior distributions, such as the constant prior and the independent Jeffreys prior, typically result in improper posterior distributions for this model. Next, the reference prior for the model is developed and is shown to yield a proper posterior distribution. A further attractive property of the reference prior is that it can be used directly for computation of Bayes factors or posterior probabilities of hypotheses to compare different correlation functions, even though the reference prior is improper. An illustration is given using a spatial dataset of topographic elevations. © 2001, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Techniques such as late potential (LP) measurements in the high-resolution electrocardiogram (HRECG), abnormal intra-QRS potentials (AIQP), and time-frequency measurements, have been used for evaluating signals of patients with chagasic myocarditis. The goal of these indexes is to identify different stages of the disease, however their predictive performance is not fully satisfactory. In this work, we extend the previous developments using a wavelet based Bayesian modelling approach for analyzing and classifying unfiltered HRECG signals. We evaluate the predictive capabilities of the proposed model through a Bayesian classification based on maximum posterior probability. The technique provides considerably higher specificity and accuracy rates and may improve the predictive values of HRECG in assessing chagasic myocarditis.","Helicobacter pylori has been recognized as a major gastric pathogen. The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of common clinical tests to detect H. pylori infection, by comparison with PCR. Serum and gastric biopsy specimens from 106 dyspeptic patients were examined. Serology was performed with Pyloriset Dry test, and biopsies were examined histologically, for rapid urease activity and PCR amplification of an ureA gene segment of H. pylori. PCR primers were specific for H. pylori and required at least 1.47 pg of H. pylori DNA, corresponding to about 800 bacterial cells. According to serology, histology, rapid urease, and PCR, positive results were respectively found in 56%, 86%, 64%, and 85% of dyspeptic patients, primarily with gastritis. Relative to PCR, the sensitivity (and specificity) was 55% (38%) for serology, 86% (13%) for histology, 70% (69%) for urease. When combining histology and urease, Bayesian analysis of data indicated no advantage of using combined methods over rapid urease test alone. Histology should not any longer be considered a gold standard test for Helicobacter pylori. Urea breath test still seems the first option for non invasive diagnostic. If an invasive diagnostic is justified, highly specific and sensitive molecular methods should be used to examine specimens. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.","Hidden Markov models have been used to restore recorded signals of single ion channels buried in background noise. Parameter estimation and signal restoration are usually carried out through likelihood maximization by using variants of the Baum-Welch forward-backward procedures. This paper presents an alternative approach for dealing with this inferential task. The inferences are made by using a combination of the framework provided by Bayesian statistics and numerical methods based on Markov chain Monte Carlo stochastic simulation. The reliability of this approach is tested by using synthetic signals of known characteristics. The expectations of the model parameters estimated here are close to those calculated using the Baum-Welch algorithm, but the present methods also yield estimates of their errors. Comparisons of the results of the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach with those obtained by filtering and thresholding demonstrate clearly the superiority of the new methods.","We propose a model for non-stationary spatiotemporal data. To account for spatial variability, we model the mean function at each time period as a locally weighted mixture of linear regressions. To incorporate temporal variation, we allow the regression coefficients to change through time. The model is cast in a Gaussian state space framework, which allows us to include temporal components such as trends, seasonal effects and autoregressions, and permits a fast implementation and full probabilistic inference for the parameters, interpolations and forecasts. To illustrate the model, we apply it to two large environmental data sets: tropical rainfall levels and Atlantic Ocean temperatures.","Multiple time series of scalp electrical potential activity are generated routinely in electroencephalographic (EEG) studies. Such recordings provide important non-invasive data about brain function in human neuropsychiatric disorders. Analyses of EEG traces aim to isolate characteristics of their spatiotemporal dynamics that may be useful in diagnosis, or may improve the understanding of the underlying neurophysiology or may improve treatment through identifying predictors and indicators of clinical outcomes. We discuss the development and application of non-stationary time series models for multiple EEG series generated from individual subjects in a clinical neuropsychiatric setting. The subjects are depressed patients experiencing generalized tonic-clonic seizures elicited by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as antidepressant treatment. Two varieties of models - dynamic latent factor models and dynamic regression models - are introduced and studied. We discuss model motivation and form, and aspects of statistical analysis including parameter identifiability, posterior inference and implementation of these models via Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. In an application to the analysis of a typical set of 19 EEG series recorded during an ECT seizure at different locations over a patient's scalp, these models reveal time-varying features across the series that are strongly related to the placement of the electrodes. We illustrate various model outputs, the exploration of such time-varying spatial structure and its relevance in the ECT study, and in basic EEG research in general.","Estimation and prediction of the amount of rainfall in time and space is a problem of fundamental importance in many applications in agriculture, hydrology, and ecology. Stochastic simulation of rainfall data is also an important step in the development of stochastic downscaling methods where large-scale climate information is considered as an additional explanatory variable of rainfall behavior at the local scale. Simulated rainfall has also been used as input data for many agricultural, hydrological, and ecological models, especially when rainfall measurements are not available for locations of interest or when historical records are not of sufficient length to evaluate important rainfall characteristics as extreme values. Rainfall estimation and prediction were carried out for an agricultural region of Venezuela in the central plains state of Guárico, where rainfall for 10-day periods is available for 80 different locations. The measurement network is relatively sparse for some areas, and aggregated rainfall at time resolutions of days or less is of very poor quality or nonexistent. We consider a model for rainfall based on a truncated normal distribution that has been proposed in the literature. We assume that the data yit, where i indexes location and t indexes time, correspond to normal random variates wit that have been truncated and transformed. According to this model, the dry periods correspond to the (unobserved) negative values and the wet periods correspond to a transformation of the positive ones. The serial structure present in series of rainfall data can be modeled by considering a stochastic process for wit. We use a dynamic linear model on wt = (w1t, …, wNt) that includes a Fourier representation to allow for the seasonality of the data that is assumed to be the same for all sites, plus a linear combination of functions of the location of each site. This approach captures year-to-year variability and provides a tool for short-term forecasting. The model is fitted using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method that uses latent variables to handle dry periods and missing values. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","The study of high resolution ECG signals (HRECG) has proven useful in assessing the risk of arrhythmic events in patients suffering chagasic myocarditis. Various time and frequency domain criteria have been developed to evaluate abnormal potentials in chagasic patients, leading to the characterization of the disease in terms of ECG features. In this work we present a Bayesian wavelet based modeling approach to analyze HRECG signals from 61 subjects classified into 3 groups: a control group of patients with no evidence of cardiac damage and two groups of chagasic patients with two different levels cardiac damage. We use of probability model that decomposes the expected value of each wavelet coefficient for a given signal in two terms: a mean component common to all signals, and a term capturing group features. The model is able to find differences among the groups in terms of estimated posterior signals and posterior distributions of the wavelet coefficients.","Wavelet Transform allows analyzing the properties of a variety of signals, being able to emphasize changes in either time or frequency domain once the appropriate scale in chosen. Since a signal can be expressed in terms of coefficients from wavelet functions, the behavior of this signal could be sparsely represented in these functions, expressing possible properties behind nonstationary signals. Recently, methods based on hierarchical Bayes analysis have been found to be a feasible tool in the approach of physical science and engineering applications. In order to participate in the apnea screening event at the Computers in Cardiology Challenge 2000 and estimate a model that could bring us to an adequate classification between groups we developed the present methodology.","This work provides a framework to perform prediction in some types of binary random fields. It is assumed the binary random field is obtained by clipping a Gaussian random field at a fixed level. The model, following a Bayesian approach, is used to map a binary outcome over a bounded region D of the plane: For each location s0 ε D, we compute the optimal predictor of Z(s0), 0 or 1, given the binary data from a realization of the random field, and provide measures of prediction uncertainty amenable for binary outcomes. The optimal predictor and the measure of prediction uncertainty are computed through data augmentation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods; a less computationally demanding plug-in approach is also described. A brief description of a geostatistical method called indicator kriging is given as well as some of its shortcomings. The prediction ability of the model is illustrated with two simulated binary maps, obtaining satisfactory results, and comparisons between the Bayesian, plug-in, and indicator kriging approaches are given.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the legislated emission reductions using monitoring data, this paper proposes a two-stage approach for the estimation of regional trends and their standard errors. In the first stage, a generalized additive model (GAM) is fitted to airborne sulfur dioxide (SO2) data at each of 35 sites in the eastern United States to estimate the form and magnitude of the site-specific trend (defined as percent total change) from 1989 to 1995. This analysis is designed to adjust the SO2 data for the influences of meteorology and season. In the second stage, the estimated trends are treated as samples with site-dependent measurement error from a Gaussian random field with a stationary covariance function. Kriging methodology is adapted to construct spatially-smoothed estimates of the true trend for three large regions in the eastern U.S. Finally, a Bayesian analysis with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is used to obtain regional trend estimates and their standard errors, which take account of the estimation of the unknown covariance parameters as well as the stochastic variation of the random fields. Both spatial estimation techniques produced similar results in terms of regional trend and standard error.

Several detection schemes and algorithms have been proposed; however, this problem has not been satisfactory solved and remains the main error source for accurate automatic detection and classification of supraventricular arrhythmias, mainly in ambulatory applications and in coronary care units. Some detection methods have been proposed, but none of them have been quantitatively tested or compared, due in part to the lack of a database with annotated P-waves. In this work, a classification stage is proposed as a new decision strategy to improve a P-wave detector previously developed in our laboratory. A quantitative evaluation of the original detector, the proposed classification stage and two other classical P-wave detectors is performed by means of the calculation of their receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Results show the increased performance provided by the new classification stage with respect to the originally developed algorithm and two classical P-wave detection methods. © 2000 The Institute of Measurement and Control.","We explore and illustrate the use of time series decomposition methods for evaluating and comparing latent structure in nonstationary electroencephalographic (EEG) traces obtained from depressed patients during brain seizures induced as part of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Analysis of the patterns of change over time in the frequency structure of such EEG data provides insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms of action of this effective but poorly understood antidepressant treatment, and allows clinicians to modify ECT treatments to optimize therapeutic benefits while minimizing associated side effects. Our work has introduced new methods of time-frequency analysis of EEG series that identify the complete pattern of time evolution of frequency structure over the course of a seizure, and usefully assist in these scientific and clinical studies. New methods of decomposition of flexible dynamic models provide time domain decompositions of individual EEG series into collections of latent components in different frequency bands. This allows us to explore ECT seizure characteristics via inferences on the time-varying parameters that characterize these latent components, and to relate differences in such characteristics across seizures to differences in the therapeutic effectiveness and cognitive side effects of those seizures. This article discusses the scientific context and problems, development of nonstationary time series models and new methods of decomposition to explore time-frequency structure, and aspects of model fitting and analysis. We include applied studies on two datasets from recent clinical ECT studies. One is an initial illustrative analysis of a single EEG trace, the second compares the EEG data recorded during two types of ECT treatment that differ in therapeutic effectiveness and cognitive side effects. The uses of these models and time series decomposition methods in extracting and contrasting key features of the seizure underlying the EEG signals are highlighted. Through the use of these models we have quantified, for the first time, decreases in the dominant frequencies of low-frequency EEG components during ECT seizures. We have also identified preliminary evidence that such decreases are enhanced under the more effective ECTs at higher electrical dosages, a finding consistent with prior reports and the hypothesis that more effective forms of ECT are more effective in eliciting neurophysiological inhibitory processes. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","The information provided by different geophysical data sets (gravimetric, magnetic, seismic, etc.) can be used, together with petrophysical and geostatistical information, to estimate the major lithological properties of the rocks within the studied volume. The formalization of this inverse problem requires a joint representation and parameterization of the different media properties in the model. The information relating rock properties together couples the inversion of the plural geophysical data sets and allows one to relate the observations with the lithological parameters of the model. The representation by probability density functions (pdfs) of the different types of information entering the problem is also required and provides the mathematical framework to formulate their combination. The resulting joint posterior pdf is composed of two factors: the joint likelihood function, which is the product of independent likelihood functions associated with each geophysical data set, and the joint prior pdf. The latter decomposes, following a partition of the model parameter space in a primary (lithological) subspace and secondary (physical) subspace, as a marginal pdf over the primary model parameter space and a conditional plover the secondary model parameter space. A Markov-chain Monte Carlo method was adapted to sample joint models from the posterior pdf: (1) the method starts with a Markov-chain sampling primary models from the marginal prior pdf, (2) the chain is extended to the joint model space, by sampling from the conditional pdf of the secondary parameters with respect to the primary parameters, and (3) it is modified to sample from the posterior pdf, by applying the Metropolis rule, which uses the evaluation of the joint likelihood function to accept or reject model transitions in the sampling chain. Finally, posterior marginal or posterior conditional pdfs for the model parameters or the model properties can be straightforwardly calculated from the set of joint models sampled by the chain.

The problem of modelling rainfall accumulated over fixed periods of time and recorded at meteorological stations at different sites is studied by using a model based on the assumption that the data follow a truncated and transformed multivariate normal distribution. The spatial correlation is modelled by using an exponentially decreasing correlation function and an interpolating surface for the means. Missing data and dry periods are handled within a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework using latent variables. We estimate the amount of rainfall as well as the probability of a dry period by using the predictive density of the data. We considered a model based on a full second-degree polynomial over the spatial co-ordinates as well as the first two Fourier harmonics to describe the variability during the year. Predictive inferences on the data show very realistic results, capturing the typical rainfall variability in time and space for that region. Important extensions of the model are also discussed.","Modelling data that correspond to rainfall accumulated over fixed periods of time presents the challenging problem of dealing with a random variable that has a point mass at zero which corresponds to dry periods that occur with positive probability. One way to overcome this difficulty is to assume that the data correspond to a normal variate w, that has been truncated and transformed. The dry periods correspond to the (unobserved) negative values and the wet periods correspond to some power of the positive ones. The serial structure that is present in rainfall can be modelled by imposing a serial structure to w. We use a dynamic linear model on w using a Fourier representation to allow for the seasonality of the data, which in the case of tropical rainfall is very marked. The model is fitted using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method that uses latent variables to handle both dry periods and missing values. We use the model to estimate and predict both the amount of rainfall and the probability of a dry period. The method is illustrated with data collected in the Venezuelan state of Guarico.\nModelling data that correspond to rainfall accumulated over fixed periods of time presents the challenging problem of dealing with a random variable that has a point mass at zero which corresponds to dry periods that occur with positive probability.

Bayesian analysis was used to establish the cutoff between positive and negative sera. In order to determine the assessment of the ELISA test, the results obtained were compared with those from an IFA. A relative sensibility of 98.39%, a specificity of 95.12% and a predictive value of 96.83% were determined. The standardized technique was used to evaluate the antibody production against trypanosome in an experimentally infected equine, in which the sera converted 15 days after infection. The test was also used for a study of sera prevalence in a non-random sample from two different populations. A prevalence of 81.7% in workhorse and 57.14% in stable horses was found.

We consider simple approximations for the first and second moments of the parameters of a Bayesian random effects model for meta-analysis. These computationally inexpensive methods are based on simple analytical formulae that provide an efficient tool for a qualitative analysis and a quick numerical estimation of posterior quantities. They are shown to lead to sensible approximations in two examples of meta-analyses and to be in broad agreement with the more computationally intensive Gibbs sampling.","An automatic Bayesian method for analysing irregular likelihoods with shifted unknown origin is proposed. Our procedure makes use of Bayesian marginalization by integration of parameters and of a convenient grouped likelihood function. The method is illustrated for the Weibull 3 likelihood and for the difficult situation of a shifted power transformation. Atkinson, Pericchi and Smith developed a grouped likelihood procedure for the shifted power transformation and conjectured that grouping the likelihood should have beneficial effects for Bayesian inference also. In this papers conjecture is shown to be correct. Moreover, by analysing two sets of data, it is illustrated that our Bayesian procedure is both more informative regarding the shifted origin and more robust with respect to the truncation factor than grouped likelihood methods that have previously been proposed.","The focus of this study is to formulate a speech parameter estimation algorithm for analysis/detection of vocal fold pathology. The speech processing algorithm proposed estimates features necessary to formulate a stochastic model to characterize healthy and pathology conditions from speech recordings. The general idea is to separate speech components under healthy and assumed pathology conditions. This problem is addressed using an iterative maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation procedure, based on the estimation-maximization (EM) algorithm. A new feature for characterizing pathology, termed enhanced-spectral-pathology component (ESPC), is estimated and shown to vary consistently between healthy and pathology conditions. It is also shown that the mean-area-peak-value (MAPV) and the weighted-slope (WSLOPE) indexes, which are obtained from the ESPC estimate, are meaningful measures of speech pathology conditions. For classification purposes, a five- state hidden-Markov-model (HMM) recognizer was formulated, based on the MAPV, WSLOPE, and ESPC spectral features. A set of log Mel-frequency filter bank coefficients were used to parameterize the ESPC feature. An evaluation of the HMM-based classifier was performed using speech recordings from healthy and vocal fold cancer patients of sustained vowel sounds. It is shown that while both MAPV and WSLOPE are useful features for vocal fold pathology detection, superior performance was achieved using a finer spectral representation of ESPC (e.g., a detection rate of 88.7% for pathology and 92.8% for healthy condition). One main advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require direct estimation of the glottal flow waveform. Therefore, the limitation of the inability to characterize vocal fold pathology, due to incomplete glottal closure, is no longer an issue. The results suggest that general analysis of the ESPC feature can provide a quantitative, noninvasive approach for analysis, detection, and characterization of speech production under vocal fold pathology.\nThe purpose of this study is to formulate a speech parameter estimation algorithm for analysis/detection of vocal fold pathology.

This has led Bayesians to use conventional proper prior distributions or crude approximations to Bayes factors. In this article we introduce a new criterion called the intrinsic Bayes factor, which is fully automatic in the sense of requiring only standard noninformative priors for its computation and yet seems to correspond to very reasonable actual Bayes factors. The criterion can be used for nested or nonnested models and for multiple model comparison and prediction. From another perspective, the development suggests a general definition of a “reference prior” for model comparison.

ST-T trends are processed by means of a Bayesian forecasting approach using the multistate Kalman filter. A complete procedure, intended for use in CCU/ICU monitoring areas, is proposed, in order to give the clinician an intelligent monitoring tool. The approach serves to describe trends and their changes in a symbolic way. A novel aspect is its ability to observe certain features of ST-T elevation/depression not detected by other means, and to reject artefacts and erroneous events. A sensivity of 89.58% and a predictivity of 84.31% are obtained on selected records of the European ST-T database. Using a restriction on event amplitude, the predictivity is raised to 95.55%. An ischaemia sensitivity index of 1·2 was determined. The method has been shown to be a robust and practical trend analysis tool, and seems to be appropriate for numeric/symbolic transformations in next-generation intelligent monitoring systems. © 1995 IFMBE.","SUMMARY: Let χ be a single observation from a distribution having unknown location parameter θ. Dawid (1973) provided sufficient conditions for the posterior distribution of θ to approach the prior distribution as χ tends to infinity, so that an outlier has bounded and vanishing influence on the posterior distribution. We present a result closely related to Dawid's theorem. This enables us to consider priors and likelihoods for the location problem which have bounded but nonvanishing influence on posterior moments. Examples are given. © 1995 Biometrika Trust.","The Bayesian analysis of a 2×2 contigency table with one or two fixed margins is presented as an estimation problem when using Exponential Family likelihoods with two or one free parameters, respectively. The computation of the Jeffreys priors for one or two fixed marginals is then straightforward for the canonical parameter. Jeffreys priors are proper distributions, despite of the fact that the parameter spaces are unbounded. Coupling the Jeffreys prior with exponential likelihoods thus yields a proper and automatic Bayesian analysis. Two contingency tables with one and two fixed margins are then analysed. © 1994 SEIO.","The minimal model semantics is a natural interpretation of defaults yet it often yields a behavior that is too weak. This weakness has been traced to the inability of minimal models to reflect certain implicit preferences among defaults, in particular, preferences for defaults grounded on more 'specific' information and preferences arising in causal domains. Recently, 'specificity' preferences have been explained in terms of conditionals. Here we aim to explain causal preferences. We draw mainly from ideas known in Bayesian Networks to formulate and formalize two principles that explain the basic preferences that arise in causal default reasoning. We then define a semantics based on those principles and show how variations of the algorithms used for inheritance reasoning and temporal projection can be used to compute in the resulting formalism.","We consider the problem of a hierarchical linear model with normal likelihood and variance known in the case where there is very little information about the hyperparameters. We address the problem proposing the use of a very wide class of priors that can be expressed as scale mixtures of normals. Two possibilities are considered: a class based on Double Exponential densities and a class based on Cauchy densities. An example is given to illustrate the techniques. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In this article we suggest that a convenient and simple way to incorporate model robustness is to consider a discrete set of competing sampling models, and combine it with a suitable large class of priors. This set reflects foreseeable departures of the base model, like thinner or heavier tails or asymmetry. We combine the models with different classes of priors that have been proposed in the vast literature on Bayesian robustness with respect to the prior. Also we explore links with the related literature of stable estimation and precise measurement theory, now with more than one model entertained. To these ends it will be necessary to introduce a procedure for model comparison that does not depend on an arbitrary constant or scale. We utilize a recent development on automatic Bayes factors with self-adjusted scale, the 'intrinsic Bayes factor' (Berger and Pericchi, Technical Report, 1993). © 1994.","A useful non-parametric class of priors is formed as those probability measures which lie between an upper and a lower measure and it is called a Wand of probability measures Lavine (1991), Moreno and Pericchi (1991), Wasserman and Kadane (1992). This class allows considerable freedom in tail behaviour as long as the upper and lower measures have different tails. This property is inherited from the class of Interval of measures DeRobertis and Hartigan (1981), from which the Band of probability measures class is obtained by restricting attention to those measures that integrate to one, Although the analysis of this restricted class is somewhat more involved, the restriction is quite natural and may lead to robustness in situations in which the larger class is not robust. In fact, it is a generalization of the class implicitly considered by Edwards, Lindman and Savage (1963) in \"Precise Measurement Theory\". An empirical analysis is performed with the two classes above. That is, we choose within a class of priors that measure which maximizes the probability of the actual data Good (1983). This \"optimal\" measure is used in this robust Bayesian context to assess the band of probability measures. © 1993 SEIO.","In the robust Bayesian literature in order to investigate robustness with respect to the functional form of a base prior distribution π0 (in particular with respect to the shape of the prior tails) the ε-contamination model of prior distributions Γ={π: π=(1-ε)π0(θ|λ)+εq,q∈Q}, has been proposed. Here π0(θ|λ) is the base elicited prior, λ is a vector of fixed hyperparameters, q is a contamination belonging to some suitable class Q and ε reflects the amount of error in π0(θ|λ). For the location-scale family of priors π0(θ|λ=τ-1π0[(θ-μ)/τ}], where λ=(μ,τ), it turns out that the posterior inference is highly sensitive to changes of λ. Therefore, instead of considering a single base prior π0, it is reasonable to replace π0(θ;|λ) by π0(θ|λ1)=∝π0(θ|λ1,λ2)h(dλ2), where λ1 is the 'known' part of λ and λ2 is the 'uncertain' part, with the uncertainty reflected by allowing hε{lunate}H (H being a class of probability measures). Classes considered here include those with unimodality and quantile constraints. Ranges of posterior probabilities of any set may be computed. Illustrations related to normal hypothesis testing are given. © 1993.","For Bayesian inference in one-parameter contexts where either the likelihood or the prior has an exponential family form, relationships are derived for posterior moments and cumulants of (functions of) both the canonical and the expectation parameters. The identities exhibited generalize the simple relationships well known in the conjugate analysis case. Applications of these results are indicated in the areas of Bayesian robustness and approximation. In particular, results are obtained on the behavior of the posterior distribution for a large observation, generalizing work of Meeden and Isaacson. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","In this work we examine the ε-contaminat ion model of prior densities Γ= π=(1-ε)π (θ) + εq; q∊G}, where π0(θ) is the base elicited prior, q is a contamination belonging to some suitable class G and c reflects the amount of error in π0(θ). Various classes with shape and/or quantile constraints are analysed, and a posterior robust analysis is carried out. It turns out that quantile restrictions alone do not produce asymptotical rational behaviour, so it is unavoidable to introduce shape constraints as well. The conclusions are in line with those of O'Hagan and Berger ( 1988). Illustrations related to testing hypothesis and likelihood sets are given. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The Bayesian method has significant advantages over the classical method since it enables all types of uncertainty (physical, parameter, distribution) associated with the design wave prediction to be handled in a consistent manner in the same analysis. The basic principles of the Bayesian method for drawing inferences are outlined step-by-step. It is shown how Bayesian estimators of return values for wave heights are established by taking an expectation over all parameters and contending distributions. When the Bayesian procedure is applied to large data sets, such as wave data sets, computational difficulties could be encountered, making a \"remedial\" procedure necessary. However, the Bayesian procedure has been used successfully with wave data sets from the northern North Sea. Furthermore, the associated remedial procedure is such that the program can be made suitable for many existing computers, e.g. desk computers. © 1988.","An algorithm to obtain the minimum state-space realization of a linear multivariable system, based on its parametric input-output model, is presented. A special canonic form for the state-space representation is used, which guarantees the uniqueness of the derived relationships between this representation and the input-output form. © 1985.","SUMMARY: We consider the standard Bayesian procedure for discrimination, focusing on its tendency to give low posterior probabilities to some correct models, even in conditions of moderate to large sampling sizes. Furthermore, in some situations that could well occur in practice, the standard procedure is even asymptotically inconsistent. We claim that the explanation is that the standard procedure inflates the posterior probability of the model that has the smallest expected increase in information about its parameters. We then propose to modify it by an amount related to the expected gain in information, and show that the 'Lindley paradox' does not occur. Finally, we obtain the limiting alternative criterion that results by letting the prior densities become noninformative, which enables us to measure how sensitive the discrimation is to the informative prior densities used. © 1984 Biometrika Trust.","The analysis of transformation of observations in the linear model with normal errors proposed by Box & Cox (1964) is considered. A different choice of noninformative unnormed prior is advocated, which is not outcome dependent.
