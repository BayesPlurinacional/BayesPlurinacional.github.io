In a more realistic scenario, both links and nodes might fail or may exhibit degradation behavior before failing. This study develops a framework to estimate the all-terminal reliability of a network that considers the degradation and probability of failure of all nodes and links in a network. Unlike previous works on network reliability that considered constant reliability for links, this paper considers the reliability of links, nodes, and the network as functions of time. In the proposed framework, the Bayesian methods (BM) are employed to estimate the reliability of links and nodes as functions of time considering degradation data. Due to the complexity of the all-terminal reliability problem, and to get fast estimations of the reliability of a network, an integration of Monte Carlo (MC) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is proposed. The proposed MC algorithm can estimate the network reliability for given nodes and links reliability values. To speed up the calculation, a DNN model is integrated into the framework, thus enabling accurate and fast estimation of network reliability for given link and node reliability values. The DNN accuracy, based on the RMSE (0.01460), outperforms previous traditional artificial neural network (ANN) approaches. Moreover, the DNN model takes 0.3 ms to compute the reliability for any given links and reliability values. The proposed framework can provide not only reliability point estimates but also credible intervals. Finally, we take advantage of Bayesian methods to integrate new data into the framework as they become available. The framework uses the new data to refine and further update the degradation model parameters and the prediction of the reliability of links, nodes, and the network. The proposed methodology has been demonstrated with the real-world network topology Ion (125 nodes, 150 links) with actual degradation data. © 2022","<b>A Fuzzy System Classification Approach for QSAR Modeling of αAmylase and α-Glucosidase Inhibitors<\/b><br><br>Introduction: This report proposes the application of a new Machine Learning algorithm called Fuzzy Unordered Rules Induction Algorithm (FURIA)-C in the classification of druglike compounds with antidiabetic inhibitory ability toward the main two pharmacological targets: α-amylase and α-glucosidase. Methods: The two obtained QSAR models were tested for classification capability, achieving satisfactory accuracy scores of 94.5% and 96.5%, respectively. Another important outcome was to achieve various α-amylase and α-glucosidase fuzzy rules with high Certainty Factor values. Fuzzyrules derived from the training series and active classification rules were interpreted. An important external validation step, comparing our method with those previously reported, was also included. Results: The Holm’s test comparison showed significant differences (p-value<0.05) between FURIA-C, Linear Discriminating Analysis (LDA), and Bayesian Networks, the former beating the two latter according to the relative ranking score of the Holm’s test. Conclusion: From these results, the FURIA-C algorithm could be used as a cutting-edge technique to predict (classify or screen) the α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of new compounds and hence speed up the discovery of new potent multi-target antidiabetic agents. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.","<b>DNA links Andean tepui endemic Helonoma peruviana to Hapalorchis (Orchidaceae, Spiranthinae)<\/b><br><br>Helonoma peruviana is here reported as a generic and specific addition to the Ecuadorian orchid flora based on a plant found recently in the Cordillera del Cóndor. The systematic position of H. peruviana was assessed by means of a Bayesian inference analysis of plastid (matK-trnK, trnL-trnF) and nuclear (ITS) DNA sequences from 43 genera and 50 species of Spiranthinae, plus suitable outgroups. The analysis recovered H. peruviana as the strongly supported sister of Hapalorchis, being more distantly related to Beloglottis, a genus in which Helonoma has been merged at the sectional level. Despite some differences in perianth morphology, Helonoma and Hapalorchis share both vegetative (densely pubescent roots, decumbent rhizome) and reproductive traits (similar column and pollinarium morphology). Helonoma has a disjunct distribution between the Guiana Shield and the Andean tepui region, and H. peruviana is restricted to the later in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. © 2022 Magnolia Press.","<b>Impact of the 2007–2008 United States Economic Crisis on Pet Ownership<\/b><br><br>Limited literature explores the relationship between economic impacts and pet ownership.

In the current study, we answer this question by looking at the time series of pet ownership and children present in U.S. households from 2003 to 2018. We utilize a causal inference technique to compare the estimated real trend of pet ownership in American households against the scenario in which the 2007–2008 financial crisis would not have occurred. Our findings suggest that the financial crisis triggered households to own more pets, specifically dogs and cats. © 2022 by the authors.","<b>The impact of climate change on the distribution of Sphyrna lewini in the tropical eastern Pacific<\/b><br><br>Variability and climate change due to anthropic influence have brought about alterations to marine ecosystems, that, in turn, have affected the physiology and metabolism of ectotherm species, such as the common hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini). However, the impact that climate variability may have on this species’ distribution, particularly in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor, which is considered an area with great marine biodiversity, is unknown. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effect of derivate impact of climate change on the oceanographic distribution of the hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor, contrasting the present and future scenarios for 2050. The methodology used was an ecological niche model based on the KUENM R package software that uses the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt). The modelling was made for the year 2050 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios. A total of 952 models were made, out of which only one met the statistical parameters established as optimal, for future scenarios. The environmental suitability for S.lewini shows that this species would migrate to the south in the Chilean Pacific, associated with a possible warming that the equatorial zone will have and the possible cooling that the subtropical zone of the South Pacific will have by 2050, the product of changes in oceanographic dynamics. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","<b>Phylogeography and evolutionary history of the Panamic Clingfish Gobiesox adustus in the Tropical Eastern Pacific<\/b><br><br>The Panamic Clingfish Gobiesox adustus is widely distributed in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP), from the central Gulf of California, Mexico to Ecuador, including the oceanic Revillagigedo Archipelago, and Isla del Coco. This cryptobenthic species is restricted to very shallow rocky-reef habitats. Here, we used one mitochondrial and three nuclear DNA markers from 155 individuals collected across the distribution range of the species in order to evaluate if geographically structured populations exist and to elucidate its evolutionary history. Phylogenetic analyses recovered a monophyletic group, with four well-supported, allopatric subgroups. Each subgroup corresponded to one of the following well-known biogeographic regions/provinces: 1) the Revillagigedo Archipelago, 2) the Cortez + Mexican provinces (Mexico), 3) the Panamic province (from El Salvador to Ecuador), and 4) Isla del Coco. A molecular-clock analysis showed a mean date for the divergence between clade I (the Revillagigedos and Cortez + Mexican provinces) and clade II (Panamic province and Isla del Coco) in the Pliocene, at ca. 5.33 Mya. Within clade I, the segregation between the Revillagigedos and Cortez + Mexican province populations was dated at ca. 1.18 Mya, during the Pleistocene. Within clade II, the segregation between samples of Isla del Coco and the Panamic province samples was dated at ca. 0.77 Mya, during the Pleistocene. The species tree, Bayesian species delimitation tests (BPP and STACEY), the ΦST, AMOVA, and the substantial genetic distances that exist between those four subgroups, indicate that they are independent evolutionary units. These cladogenetic events seem to be related to habitat discontinuities, and oceanographic and geological processes that produce barriers to gene flow for G. adustus, effects of which are enhanced by the intrinsic ecological characteristics of this species. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Anthropogenic deforestation and climate dryness as drivers of demographic decline and genetic erosion in the southernmost European fir forests<\/b><br><br>A better understanding of long-term effects of climate and historical anthropogenic changes is needed to define effective conservation measures of endangered forest inhabiting managed landscapes. Diversification and distribution of Mediterranean firs are attributed to the global climate change during the Miocene and Quaternary as well as to the effects of human-driven deforestation. We evaluated the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities in shaping the genetic diversity and structure of Abies pinsapo Boiss. (Pinaceae), a relict fir endemic from SW Spain. We genotyped a total of 440 individuals from 44 populations by using two different molecular markers (cpSSRs and nSSRs). Overall, low genetic structure was found; however, incipient differentiation appeared within mountain ranges. Analyses suggest that the effects of isolation by distance and lithological or topographical diversity were not enough to structure the populations of the different mountain ranges. The combined role of genetic drift in the small populations and the anthropogenic action associated with forest management has shaped the current genetic pattern of this fir species in the study area. Demographic inference analyses pointed to a very recent synchronic divergence (eleventh–sixteenth century) of the ancestral A. pinsapo population into its current scattered distribution range. Although population bottlenecks were supported by several analyses, the conservation of this endangered species seems not to be limited by lacking genetic diversity, while threats of current climate change and habitat loss must be regarded. © 2022, The Author(s).","<b>Occupancy winners in tropical protected forests: A pantropical analysis<\/b><br><br>The structure of forest mammal communities appears surprisingly consistent across the continental tropics, presumably due to convergent evolution in similar environments. Whether such consistency extends to mammal occupancy, despite variation in species characteristics and context, remains unclear. Here we ask whether we can predict occupancy patterns and, if so, whether these relationships are consistent across biogeographic regions. Specifically, we assessed how mammal feeding guild, body mass and ecological specialization relate to occupancy in protected forests across the tropics. We used standardized camera-trap data (1002 camera-trap locations and 2-10 years of data) and a hierarchical Bayesian occupancy model. We found that occupancy varied by regions, and certain species characteristics explained much of this variation. Herbivores consistently had the highest occupancy. However, only in the Neotropics did we detect a significant effect of body mass on occupancy: large mammals had lowest occupancy. Importantly, habitat specialists generally had higher occupancy than generalists, though this was reversed in the Indo-Malayan sites. We conclude that habitat specialization is key for understanding variation in mammal occupancy across regions, and that habitat specialists often benefit more from protected areas, than do generalists. The contrasting examples seen in the Indo-Malayan region probably reflect distinct anthropogenic pressures. © 2022 The Authors.","<b>A Spatially Correlated Model with Generalized Autoregressive Conditionally Heteroskedastic Structure for Counts of Crimes<\/b><br><br>Crime is a negative phenomenon that affects the daily life of the population and its devel-opment. When modeling crime data, assumptions on either the spatial or the temporal relationship between observations are necessary if any statistical analysis is to be performed. In this paper, we structure space–time dependency for count data by considering a stochastic difference equation for the intensity of the space–time process rather than placing structure on a latent space–time process, as Cox processes would do. We introduce a class of spatially correlated self-exciting spatio-temporal models for count data that capture both dependence due to self-excitation, as well as dependence in an underlying spatial process. We follow the principles in Clark and Dixon (2021) but considering a generalized additive structure on spatio-temporal varying covariates. A Bayesian framework is proposed for inference of model parameters. We analyze three distinct crime datasets in the city of Riobamba (Ecuador). Our model fits the data well and provides better predictions than other alternatives. © 2022 by the authors.

The algorithm initially takes the ABC-SubSim algorithm structure and sequentially estimates the algorithm hyper-parameter by autonomous adaptation following a Markov chain approach, thus avoiding the error associated to modeler's choice for these hyper-parameters. The resulting algorithm, named (Formula presented.) BC-SubSim, simplifies the application of ABC-SubSim method for new users while ensuring better measure of accuracy in the posterior distribution and improved computational efficiency. A first numerical application example is provided for illustration purposes and to provide a comparative and sensitivity analysis of the algorithm with respect to initial ABC-SubSim algorithm. Moreover, the efficiency of the method is demonstrated in two nonlinear structural calibration case studies where the (Formula presented.) BC-SubSim is used as a tool to infer structural parameters with quantified uncertainty based on test data. The results confirm the suitability of the method to tackle with a real-life damage parameter inference and its superiority in relation to the original ABC-SubSim. © 2021 The Authors.

Three competing variables are considered in the bivariate setup along with GDP: the unemployment rate, the inflation rate, and gross domestic income. We find that the unemployment rate is the preferred variable to accompany GDP in the bivariate setup to obtain accurate estimates of its trend–cycle correlation coefficient and the cycle. We show that the key feature of the unemployment rate that allows for reliable estimates of the cycle of GDP is that its nonstationary component is small relative to its cyclical component. Using quarterly GDP and unemployment rate data from 1948:Q1 to 2019:Q1, we obtain a trend–cycle decomposition of GDP that resembles the conventional CBO estimates; we find positively correlated trend and cycle components. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","<b>Assessing the conservation of eastern Ecuadorian cloud forests in climate change scenarios<\/b><br><br>The Tropical Montane Cloud Forests (TMCF) of South America are ecosystems facing rapid changes due to global warming. Herein, we used species climatic niche models to reconstruct the climatic boundaries of TMCF and to predict range shifts in climate change scenarios. Thirty-two species from three taxonomic groups (plants, birds, and amphibians) were modelled using community-level niche models under current and future climatic scenarios, as determined by two Global Climate Models (GCMs) for the year 2050. The community-level reconstructions were used to detect the overlap of TMCF with surrounding ecosystems and with current protected areas (PA). Approximate 42–54% area reduction and 207–429 m upward elevational shift was predicted under climate scenarios. Accordingly, severe environmental contractions (loss of suitability area) due to climate change were detected by our models. TMCF area within PA may increase 17–38% by 2050. We identified transition zones rather than clear limits of vegetational boundaries of TMCF with adjacent ecosystems, which suggested that both TMCF and transitional zones will be impacted, to what conservation strategies targeting TMCF and adjacent ecosystems should be prioritized. © 2022 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação","<b>Measuring uncertainty: A streamlined application for the Ecuadorian economy<\/b><br><br>This paper develops a macroeconomic uncertainty index based on the multistage procedure that combines maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation methods proposed by Jurado et al. (Am Econ Rev 105(3):1177–1216, 2015). Our approach streamlines the computation of the macroeconomic uncertainty index by specifying a state-space model estimated by maximum likelihood that allows us to obtain in one step the parameters of the model, the dynamic factors, and the forecast errors of the macroeconomic variables used to construct the index. Moreover, we estimate stochastic volatility models on the forecast errors also by maximum likelihood using a density filter that proves to be faster than a Bayesian estimation. After showing that our methodology produces reasonable results for the USA, we apply it to compute a macroeconomic uncertainty index for Ecuador, becoming the first index of this kind for a small developing or middle-income country. The results show that the Ecuadorian economy is more volatile and less predictable during recessions. We also provide evidence that macroeconomic uncertainty is detrimental to economic activity, finding that the responses of non-oil output, employment in the formal sector, and consumer prices to macroeconomic uncertainty shocks are sizable and persistent. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","<b>APPLYING BAYESIAN NETWORKS IN STUDENT DROPOUT DATA<\/b><br><br>This paper presents a proposal to implement a cluster method that best engages the educational data (socio-economic, academic achievement and dropouts) at the Engineering Faculty of Quevedo State Technical University.

Using a realist approach of policy design, a causal mechanism linking transparency and public accountability is tested on the case of Chile´s environmental reforms, during the first Bachelet administration (2006–2010). Our hypothesis is that transparency improves public accountability through a causal mechanism made of two sets of formulation and calibration activities producing the causal entities responsible for the policy outcome. In order to empirically assess this causal mechanism, we treat policy instruments of information, regulation, treasure and organization as expected empirical observations along the process. We run five series of hoop tests on these instruments and use Bayes theorem of likelihood to update our confidence in the hypothesized mechanism. Our findings indicate that transparency institutionalization is shaped by a policy style combining a decentralized coordination mode with genuine collaborative governance. This has practical implications, not only for Chile´s on-going application to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) certification but also for any country interested in improving environmental governance in the extractive sector. © 2021","<b>Inter-portfolio credit risk contagion including macroeconomic and financial factors: A case study for Ecuador<\/b><br><br>Daily banking practice suggests that there may be contagion effects between portfolios, a fact that has been explicitly recognized through current regulation.

Delinquency among consumers, microcredit, and housing portfolios and their exogenous determinants were simultaneously quantified using a Bayesian vector autoregressive model. The results show that shocks in exogenous variables are often transmitted immediately in all portfolios. Simultaneously, the autoregressive terms take up to six months to affect these variables, but not cumulatively. A unit of shock in consumer delinquency causes an increase in microcredit delinquency immediately, and this effect is maintained until one month later, where it stabilizes and disappears at the tenth month. Furthermore, a unit of shock in microcredit delinquency produces an increase in consumer delinquency only in the medium term, after seven months. Including inter-portfolio linkages in credit, risk quantification allows to understand the micro-dynamics of absolute risk better and to evaluate the systemic importance of individual shocks since their impact spreads among portfolios with a domino effect. Further research in this area might focus on how to use these techniques as operational tools to incorporate financial stability considerations into control risk policy decision-making. © 2021 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland","<b>Evaluation of COVID-19 Surveillance Strategy in Ecuador<\/b><br><br>Objectives: Evaluate the relevance of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive case detection policy or model implemented by the Ministry of Public Health (MPH) of Ecuador and to compare it with the experiences of other countries. Methods: Data contained the daily reports publicized by the MPH. The formulations were carried out under the Conditioned Probability modality applying Bayes' Theorem. All the COVID-19 tests applied in relation to the confirmed cases per million inhabitants were considered to obtain their level of positivity, and compared with the experience of Iceland and South Korea. Results: The probability of detecting positive cases of COVID-19 in Ecuador was higher than Iceland and South Korea, because the diagnostic tests were aimed at symptomatic patients, without identifying asymptomatic or mild symptomatic, who play an important role in the transmission of the disease. In addition, many symptomatic patients were examined but will remain undiagnosed due to the unavailability of tests and the low quality of many of them. Conclusions: The daily reports on the behavior of the COVID-19 issued by the Ecuadorian government do not adequately represent the growth in the number of those infected each day, nor the actual behavior of the epidemic, affecting possible control measures.

We studied the spatio-temporal diversification of a tree frog clade distributed throughout Amazonia (Anura: Hylidae: Osteocephalus, Tepuihyla, and Dryaderces) and tested the hypothesis that Miocene mega wetlands located in western and central Amazonia impacted connectivity among major biogeographic areas during extensive periods. We assessed the group’s diversity through DNA-based (16S rRNA) species delimitation to identify Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) from 557 individuals. We then selected one terminal for each OTU (n = 50) and assembled a mitogenomic matrix (~14,100 bp; complete for 17 terminals) to reconstruct a Bayesian, time-calibrated phylogeny encompassing nearly all described species. Ancestral area reconstruction indicates that each genus was restricted to one of the major Amazonian biogeographic areas (western Amazonia, Guiana Shield and Brazilian Shield, respectively) between ~10 and 20 Mya, suggesting that they diverged and diversified in isolation during this period around the Pebas mega wetland. After 10 Mya and the transition to the modern configuration of the Amazon River watershed, most speciation within each genus continued to occur within each area. In Osteocephalus, only three species expanded widely across Amazonia (< 6 Mya), and all were pond-breeders. Species with other breeding modes remained mostly restricted to narrow ranges. The spectacular radiation of Osteocephalus was probably driven by climatic stability, habitat diversity and the acquisition of new reproductive modes along the Andean foothills and western Amazonia. Our findings add evidence to the importance of major hydrological changes during the Miocene on biotic diversification in Amazonia. © 2022, The Author(s).","<b>HIERARCHICAL BAYESIAN NETWORK TO ANALYZE EDUCATIONAL DATA<\/b><br><br>This document presents a proposal to implement a cluster method that best matches the educational data. The use of probabilistic graphic models in the field of education has been considered for this research. But the problem with these general learning procedures comes from the presence of a high number of variables that measure different aspects of the same concept. In this case, we have that all variables have some degree of dependence between them, without a true causal structure. Therefore, a new procedure is presented that makes a hierarchical grouping of the data while learning a joint probability distribution. We try to make a test for each case where the probability is measured in each model using propagation algorithms. Then, the probability logarithm is applied to each case and the results are added in each model to determine the best fit for the proposed one.

In 2017–18 we collected, from a farm located in the Ecuadorian province of Cotopaxi, 30 buds of the rose ‘Vendela’ that showed petal lesions similar to those caused by grey mould. For causal agent isolation and morphological characterization, the infected tissue was incubated on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Isolated fungal colonies grown on PDA showed grey-olive to dark green mycelium and conidia borne in chains with zero to three longitudinal septa and two to six transversal septa, indicating the presence of an Alternaria sp. A multilocus Bayesian inference phylogenetic analysis, including the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), RNA polymerase II (RPB2), and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1) gene regions, indicated that the isolates clustered with isolates of A. alternata. After pathogenicity analysis, A. alternata-inoculated rose petals showed similar symptoms to botrytis blight. To fulfill Koch’s postulates, the pathogen was re-isolated successfully.

Later, an ensemble learning model has been used to differentiate cough from other environmental sounds, putting those algorithms together and choosing the best result as the performance of the system. The final system consists of a preprocessing stage where the audio signals are adjusted through data augmentation, normalization, removal of silent fragments, and the transformation to Mel spectrograms, while, on back-end stage, three models have been evaluated: a convolutional neural network, a random forest, and a classifier based on hidden Markov models. We assembled a hard voting classifier (VC) model from the three models to obtain a more robust and reliable model. The VC model reached the highest precision and F1-score values without false-negative and up to 75% of true-positive values. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","<b>Deep Ensemble-Based Classifier for Transfer Learning in Rotating Machinery Fault Diagnosis<\/b><br><br>Nowadays, intelligent models can correctly detect faults by analysing signals from rotating machinery. However, most of the studies are run in controlled environments and the performance in industrial real-world environments is not yet fully validated. Hence, a suitable tool to implement fault diagnosers is transfer learning, this topic is under development and challenges persist. This paper proposes a framework for creating accurate 1D-CNN based fault classifiers that can be transferred between different rotating machines and working conditions. Multiple Bayesian processes select architecture parameters and hyperparameters, which minimize a loss function related to their transferability to other machines and to the same machine under different operating conditions (such as load and engine speed). The resulting model is fitted to heterogeneous fault diagnosis data resulting in a 1D-CNN ensemble that improves the performance of the unitary model. Subsequently, the transfer learning capability of the ensemble is analyzed on two source data sets using function and parameter based transfer. The results are compared with classical fault diagnosis classifiers. Finally, additional transfer operations on five target domain datasets validate our framework on limited labeled samples and allow interpretation of the ensemble results. The ultimate goal is to find an ensemble that can generalize fault diagnosis on rotating machinery for easy implementation and update in industrial settings. © 2013 IEEE.","<b>A Prediction Model to Prevent Phishing Attacks on E-Mails Using Data Mining Techniques<\/b><br><br>The current study presents a design and implementation of a prediction model that prevents phishing attacks on emails using data mining techniques. Hereby, we collected appropriate data sets in order to identify the characteristics of the infected emails, which allow a phishing attack to be successful from three significant sources, being Monkey.org, Enron.org, and PhishTank.com. For the design and implementation of the model, we used the CRISP-DM methodology in order to generate the detection model based on the characteristics that recognize an email as phishing. Likewise, we developed a descriptive analysis using Decision Trees, Bayesian Networks, and Random Forest as data mining algorithms, whose most precise has been Random Forest. Once the email was detected as infected, the algorithm quarantines the email. Subsequently, it sends a notification message through WhatsApp. Finally, we evaluated the model in a controlled environment. The results demonstrate the functionality of the model since it achieved a precision score greater than 97.28% in the detection of phishing emails. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>An Implementation of an Algorithm for Information Theft Using Deep Learning Techniques: An Ethical Hacking Event<\/b><br><br>Ethical hacking is modern data protection and prevention technique proper to prevent information losses.

The algorithm programmed through Python, MatLab, and R, automates the export of a data repository saved in a.CSV file, which contains all the methods to prevent an attack. In this way, when the algorithm is executed, it is trained to disable all detection mechanisms. The algorithm uses the structure of a neural network based on Deep Learning, Bayesian networks, a mathematical model, and a Rectified Linear Activation function or ReLU. It was configured to execute the algorithm on each interpreted output data. The proofs of concept were developed in a controlled virtual network environment, using a Linux-based server. The results were validated based on resource management in both processing and memory, using monitoring standards and averaging curves.

Despite their ecological importance and sensitivity to disturbances, bryophytes are overlooked in conservation strategies due to knowledge gaps on their distribution, which is known as the Wallacean shortfall. Rare species deserve priority attention in conservation as they are at a high risk of extinction. This study aims to elaborate predictive models of rare bryophyte species in Canadian boreal forests using remote sensing-derived predictors in an Ensemble of Small Models (ESMs) framework. We hypothesize that high ESMs-based prediction accuracy can be achieved for rare bryophyte species despite their low number of occurrences. We also assess if there is a spatial correspondence between rare and overall bryophyte richness patterns. The study area is located in western Quebec and covers 72,292 km2. We selected 52 bryophyte species with [removed] 0.5) for 73% of the modeled species, with AUC values > 0.8 for 19 species, which confirmed our hypothesis. In fact, ESMs provided better predictions for the rarest bryophytes. Likewise, our study revealed a spatial concordance between rare and overall bryophyte richness patterns in different regions of the study area, which have important implications for conservation planning. This study demonstrates the potential of remote sensing for assessing and making predictions on inconspicuous and rare species across the landscape and lays the basis for the eventual inclusion of bryophytes into sustainable development planning.

Tomicodon petersii, a clingfish (Gobiesocidae) endemic to the TEP, is found on very shallow rocky reefs from central Mexico to northern Peru, and in the Cocos and Galapagos islands. We evaluated the effect of likely biogeographic barriers in different parts of the TEP on the diversification process of this species. We used one mitochondrial and three nuclear DNA markers from 112 individuals collected across the distribution range of T. petersii. Our phylogenetic results showed the samples constituted a monophyletic group, with three well-supported, allopatric subgroups: in the Mexican province, the Panamic province (from El Salvador to Ecuador), and the Galapagos Islands. The split between the Mexican and more southerly clades was estimated to occur at the end of the Miocene ca. 5.74 Mya, and the subsequent cladogenetic event separating the Galapagos population from the Panamic population at the junction of the Pliocene and Pleistocene, ca. 2.85 Mya. The species tree, Bayesian species delimitation tests (BPP), STACEY, and substantial genetic distances separating these three populations indicate that these three independent evolutionary units likely include two unnamed species. The cladogenetic events that promoted the formation of those genetically differentiated groups are consistent with disruptive effects on gene flow of habitat discontinuities and oceanographic processes along the mainland shoreline in the TEP and of ocean-island isolation, in conjunction with the species intrinsic life-history characteristics. © 2021","<b>Mia‐coder: A multi‐intelligent agent‐enabled reinforcement learning for accurate coverage hole detection and recovery in unequal cluster‐tree‐based qosensing wsn<\/b><br><br>Coverage is an important factor for the effective transmission of data in the wireless sensor networks. Normally, the formation of coverage holes in the network deprives its performance and reduces the lifetime of the network. In this paper, a multi‐intelligent agent enabled reinforcement learning‐based coverage hole detection and recovery (MiA‐CODER) is proposed in order to overcome the existing challenges related to coverage of the network. Initially, the formation of coverage holes is prevented by optimizing the energy consumption in the network. This is performed by constructing the unequal Sierpinski cluster‐tree topology (USCT) and the cluster head is selected by implementing multi‐objective black widow optimization (MoBWo) to facilitate the effective transmission of data. Further, the energy consumption of the nodes is minimized by performing dynamic sleep scheduling in which Tsallis entropy enabled Bayesian probability (TE2BP) is implemented to switch the nodes between active and sleep mode. Then, the coverage hole detection and repair are carried out in which the detection of coverage holes if any, both inside the cluster and between the clusters, is completed by using the virtual sector‐based hole detection (ViSHD) protocol. Once the detection is over, the BS starts the hole repair process by using a multi-agent SARSA algorithm which selects the optimal mobile node and replaces it to cover the hole. By doing so, the coverage of the network is enhanced and better QoSensing is achieved. The proposed approach is simulated in NS 3.26 and evaluated in terms of coverage rate, number of dead nodes, average energy consumption and throughput. © 2021 by the authors.

We aimed to assess the origin, spatial patterns of genetic variation, and demographic history of the introduced populations in the contact zone of Central and Southeast Europe, using mitochondrial DNA control region sequences and microsatellite loci. Both types of molecular markers indicated relatively low to moderate levels of genetic variation. The mtDNA analyses revealed that common pheasants across the study area are divided into two distinct clades: B (mongolicus group) and F (colchicus group). Analyses of the microsatellite data consistently suggested a differentiation between Hungary and Serbia, with the pheasant population in Hungary being much more genetically homogeneous, while that of Serbia has much more genetic mixture and admixture. This cryptic differentiation was not detected using a non-spatial Bayesian clustering model. The analyses also provided strong evidence for a recent population expansion. This fundamental information is essential for adequate and effective conservation management of populations of a game species of great economic and ecological importance in the studied geographical region. © 2021, The Author(s).","<b>Intelligent models for movement detection and physical evolution of patients with hip surgery<\/b><br><br>This paper develops computational models to monitor patients with hip replacement surgery.

It has been proposed that occupation of new microhabitats may trigger selection for distinct phenotypic variants in these blood-sucking bugs. Although understanding phenotypic variation is key to the study of adaptive evolution and central to phenotype-based taxonomy, the drivers of phenotypic change and diversity in triatomines remain poorly understood. Methods/results: We combined a detailed phenotypic appraisal (including morphology and morphometrics) with mitochondrial cytb and nuclear ITS2 DNA sequence analyses to study Rhodnius ecuadoriensis populations from across the species’ range. We found three major, naked-eye phenotypic variants. Southern-Andean bugs primarily from vertebrate-nest microhabitats (Ecuador/Peru) are typical, light-colored, small bugs with short heads/wings. Northern-Andean bugs from wet-forest palms (Ecuador) are dark, large bugs with long heads/wings. Finally, northern-lowland bugs primarily from dry-forest palms (Ecuador) are light-colored and medium-sized. Wing and (size-free) head shapes are similar across Ecuadorian populations, regardless of habitat or phenotype, but distinct in Peruvian bugs. Bayesian phylogenetic and multispecies-coalescent DNA sequence analyses strongly suggest that Ecuadorian and Peruvian populations are two independently evolving lineages, with little within-lineage phylogeographic structuring or differentiation. Conclusions: We report sharp naked-eye phenotypic divergence of genetically similar Ecuadorian R. ecuadoriensis (nest-dwelling southern-Andean vs palm-dwelling northern bugs; and palm-dwelling Andean vs lowland), and sharp naked-eye phenotypic similarity of typical, yet genetically distinct, southern-Andean bugs primarily from vertebrate-nest (but not palm) microhabitats. This remarkable phenotypic diversity within a single nominal species likely stems from microhabitat adaptations possibly involving predator-driven selection (yielding substrate-matching camouflage coloration) and a shift from palm-crown to vertebrate-nest microhabitats (yielding smaller bodies and shorter and stouter heads). These findings shed new light on the origins of phenotypic diversity in triatomines, warn against excess reliance on phenotype-based triatomine-bug taxonomy, and confirm the Triatominae as an informative model system for the study of phenotypic change under ecological pressure[InlineMediaObject not available: see fulltext.]. © 2021, The Author(s).","<b>Origin and dispersion pathways of guava in the Galapagos Islands inferred through genetics and historical records<\/b><br><br>Guava (Psidium guajava) is an aggressive invasive plant in the Galapagos Islands. Determining its provenance and genetic diversity could explain its adaptability and spread, and how this relates to past human activities. With this purpose, we analyzed 11 SSR markers in guava individuals from Isabela, Santa Cruz, San Cristobal, and Floreana islands in the Galapagos, as well as from mainland Ecuador. The mainland guava population appeared genetically differentiated from the Galapagos populations, with higher genetic diversity levels found in the former. We consistently found that the Central Highlands region of mainland Ecuador is one of the most likely origins of the Galapagos populations. Moreover, the guavas from Isabela and Floreana show a potential genetic input from southern mainland Ecuador, while the population from San Cristobal would be linked to the coastal mainland regions. Interestingly, the proposed origins for the Galapagos guava coincide with the first human settlings of the archipelago. Through approximate Bayesian computation, we propose a model where San Cristobal was the first island to be colonized by guava from the mainland, and then, it would have spread to Floreana and finally to Santa Cruz; Isabela would have been seeded from Floreana. An independent trajectory could also have contributed to the invasion of Floreana and Isabela. The pathway shown in our model agrees with the human colonization history of the different islands in the Galapagos. Our model, in conjunction with the clustering patterns of the individuals (based on genetic distances), suggests that guava introduction history in the Galapagos archipelago was driven by either a single event or a series of introduction events in rapid succession. We thus show that genetic analyses supported by historical sources can be used to track the arrival and spread of invasive species in novel habitats and the potential role of human activities in such processes. © 2021 The Authors.

Consequently, heavy metal(loid)s are easily released into the environment, being a potential risk to human health. This study carries out a Bayesian probabilistic human health risk assessment, related to multi-pathway exposure to heavy metal(loid)s in a gold mining area in Southern Ecuador. Concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in tap water, surface water, and soil samples, were analyzed to assess the potential adverse human health effects based on the Hazard Index (HI) and Total cancer risk (TCR). Adults and children residents were surveyed to adjust their exposure parameters to the site-specific conditions. Exposure to heavy metal(loid)s resulted in unacceptable risk levels for human health in the two age groups, both carcinogenic (TCR > 1 × 10−5) and non-carcinogenic (HI > 1) through ingestion of tap water and incidental ingestion of surface water. Sensitivity analysis showed that As concentration in waters and exposure frequency were the main contributors to risk outcome. Exposure to soil via accidental ingestion and dermal contact was below the safety limit, not posing a risk to human health. These findings can provide a baseline for the environmental management of the mining area and indicate the need for further research on As pollution in water and its implications on the health of the inhabitants of mining communities. © 2021","<b>Ecological and probabilistic human health risk assessment of heavy metal(loid)s in river sediments affected by mining activities in Ecuador<\/b><br><br>Gold mining is a significant source of metal(loid)s released into the environment.

This study aimed to assess the ecological and human health risk caused by heavy metal(loid)s exposure in river sediments in Ponce Enríquez, one of the most important mining sites in Ecuador. Concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn were evaluated in 172 sediment samples to determine the Potential ecological risk (RI) and the carcinogenic (CR) and non-carcinogenic risk (HQ). The human exposure to polluted sediments during recreational activities was computed using Bayesian probabilistic models. Residents were randomly surveyed to adjust the risk models to the specific population data. More than 68% of the sampling stations pose a severe As and Cd ecological risk index (Eri > 320). Likewise, residents exposed to river sediments showed a non-acceptable carcinogenic risk by incidental ingestion, being As the primary contributor to overall cancer in both children and adults receptors. Moreover, non-carcinogenic risk through the incidental ingestion of sediments was above the safe limit for children. This is the first study conducted in a mining region in Ecuador that reveals the severe levels of ecological and human health risk to which the population is exposed. These results can be applied as a baseline to develop public health strategies to monitor and reduce the health hazards of the residents of mining communities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","<b>Comparison between Adam, AdaMax and Adam W optimizers to implement a Weather Forecast based on Neural Networks for the Andean city of Quito<\/b><br><br>The main function of an optimizer is to determine in what measure to change the weights and the learning rate of the neural network to reduce losses.

However, other optimizers are often chosen because they generalize in a better manner. AdamW is a variant of Adam where the weight decay is performed only after controlling the parameter-wise step size. In order to present a comparative scenario for optimizers in the present work, a Temperature Forecast for the Andean city of Quito using a neural network structure with uncertainty reduction was implemented and three optimizers (Adam, AdaMax and AdamW) were analyzed. In order to do the comparison three error metrics were obtained per hour in order to determine the effectiveness of the prediction.

Given the costs, small-and medium-sized livestock holders are not completely committed to it. The objective of this study was to determine true prevalence (TP) of bovine brucellosis in small-and medium-sized herd populations, as well as the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the Rose Bengal (RB) test and the sero-agglutination test (SAT)-EDTA using a Bayesian approach. Between 2011 and 2016, 2733 cattle herds were visited, and 22,592 animal blood samples were taken in nineteen provinces on mainland Ecuador. Bayes-p and deviance information criterion (DIC) statistics were used to select models. Additionally, risk-factor analysis was used for herds according to their brucellosis test status. True prevalence (TP) in herds was estimated by pool testing. National seroprevalence of farms was 7.9% (95% CI: 6.79–9.03), and TP was 12.2% (95% CI: 7.8–17.9). Apparent prevalence (AP) in animals was 2.2% (95% CI: 1.82–2.67), and TP was 1.6% (95% CrI: 1.0–2.4). Similarly, the sensitivity of the RB was estimated at 64.6% (95% CrI: 42.6–85.3) and specificity at 98.9% (95% CrI: 98.6–99.0); for the SAT-EDTA test, sensitivity was 62.3% (95% CrI: 40.0–84.8) and 98.9% (95% CrI: 98.6–99.1) for specificity. Results of the two tests were highly correlated in infected and uninfected animals. Likewise, high spatial variation was observed, with the Coastal Region being the zone with the highest TP at 2.5%. (95% CrI: 1.3–3.8%) in individual animals and 28.2% (95% CI: 15.7–39.8) in herds. Risk factors include herd size, type of production (milk, beef, and mixed), abortions recorded, and vaccination.

It is a new teaching-learning method in the Obstetrics course. To evaluate new methodologies, student opinion is the fundamental axis, and using the Likert scale is one of the most used tools. However, this collects quantitative data. On including ordinal measurements in its design, representing the categories of interest, the distances between the responses may not be the same. This may make it better to examine and interpret their results using ordinal analysis methods. Method: Cross-sectional study using a secondary source that included all first semester students of the degree. The results of the Likert-type questionnaire were compared using the classic t-test, Bayesian t-test, and Bayesian analysis with ordinal models. Results: There was a notable difference regarding the initial and final perception of students with the PIS methodology to achieve their objectives. Although the metric analysis models had questions that received a greater number of positive responses in the final survey, the ordinal method did not demonstrate this difference. Conclusion: The PIS methodology significantly and positively changed student perceptions as regards the fulfilment of their objectives. It is recommended to use ordinal methods, combined with Bayesian statistics, in the analysis of questionnaires using the Likert scale, in order to avoid errors in interpretation. © 2019 Elsevier España, S.L.U.","<b>Morphological, ecological and geographical evolution of the Neotropical genus Nasa (Loasaceae subfamily Loasoideae)<\/b><br><br>The Andean uplift is recognized as one of the most important events shaping the Neotropical biota.

We were able to sequence 87 of the 125 taxa (species and subspecies) of Nasa, for the plastid markers trnL-trnF, matK, trnS-trnG and rps16. Our results show that Nasa falls into four well-supported clades, clade I is sister to the rest of the genus and is composed of Central Andean species. The remaining three clades are more widely distributed, found also in the Amotape-Huancabamba Zone (AHZ) and the northern Andes. Our morphological analyses were able to identify plausible phylogenetic affinities of most Nasa spp. for which molecular data are unavailable, with three of the morphological clusters composed mostly by species of three well-supported clades (Clades II, III and IV). Historical biogeography indicates that Nasa has a history spanning 50 Myr, its early events predating most of the Andean uplift. Nasa appears to have originally occupied mid-elevation, seasonally dry habitats. By the mid-Miocene (c. 15 Mya) expansion into new forest edge and undergrowth habitats took place. This coincides with renewed uplift that increased the complexity of the abiotic conditions in the Andes. The AHZ is retrieved as the most important centre of diversification since the closure of the West Andean Portal and appears to be a cradle of clades of Nasa. Conversely, the central Andes, the most likely area of origin of the genus, house mostly ancient, species-poor clades. © 2021 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.","<b>Good policy or good luck? Analyzing the effects of fiscal policy and oil revenue shocks in Ecuador<\/b><br><br>This paper proposes a framework to estimate the effects of exogenous fiscal policy and oil revenue shocks on the macroeconomic activity of price-taking oil producers. We use a structural vector autoregressive model estimated with Bayesian methods and apply it to the Ecuadorian economy. Specifically, we investigate the effects of unanticipated changes in taxes, government consumption spending, government investment spending, and oil revenues on economic activity. The results show that unanticipated expansive fiscal policy either through taxes or government investment can have positive effects on output. However, contrary to most studies in the literature, consumption spending shocks do not significantly affect gross domestic product. We also find that oil revenue shocks influence all the variables in the model, evidencing the vulnerability of the Ecuadorian economy to fluctuations of oil revenues. Historically, oil revenue shocks have been the most important driving force to move output above or below trend. © 2021","<b>An Update of the Geographic Distribution of the Red-Mantled Saddle-Back Tamarin, Leontocebus lagonotus (Callitrichidae), in Ecuador<\/b><br><br>Understanding the geographic distributions of primates is necessary to ensure effective conservation strategies. Nonetheless, many gaps persist in information regarding the range limits of platyrrhines. Leontocebus lagonotus is no exception; it is one of the least studied primates in Ecuador and its geographic limits are poorly known. We obtained 296 records of its presence in Ecuador from field studies (between 1996 and 2020), museums, the literature, and databases. Of these, we validated 211 records and used 106 (excluding grouped points) to determine the potential distribution of this species using an ecological niche model (MaxEnt). The model suggested that the species’ distribution in Ecuador covers 64,028 km2. Based on confirmed data, the extent of occurrence was 38,226 km2, but after updating it with layers of remaining vegetation (2018), we determined that the current distribution is 32,643 km2 (a 15% reduction). Our findings reduce the range proposed for the species in Ecuador, suggesting that areas north of the Napo River, the north-central area of Yasuní National Park, and the far eastern part of Waorani Ethnic Reserve were never part of the species’ range. We also identified the southern boundaries of its distribution, where the Paute-Upano and Cangaime-Morona rivers form a natural barrier. Its distribution in Peru possibly reaches the south of the Morona and Santiago rivers. We recommend a similar approach for other platyrrhines, particularly those under threat, for better implementation of conservation efforts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","<b>Newton’s law of cooling with generalized conformable derivatives<\/b><br><br>In this communication, using a generalized conformable differential operator, a simulation of the well-known Newton’s law of cooling is made.

Despite a large number of scientific disclosures on climate change issues, few studies show the effects on vegetation in high Andean ecosystems and especially within Protected Areas. Objective. Determine a predictive model using a radical scenario to establish the behavior of four species that make up the arboreal component of the forest remnants and their potential distribution for the year 2100. Methodology. By using 19 bioclimatic variables and the orography obtained from WorldClim, the QGIS software, MaxEnt and 221 occurrences of the four tree species, the current ecological niche was modeled and projected to 2100 based on the General Circulation Model (HadCM3) and the emissions of CO2 under the RCP 6.0 scenario. Results. In general, the result of the research envisions a highly negative outlook regarding the occupation area for 2100, determining that 125 ha will decrease due to the differentiation of temperature and precipitation (Bio7, Bio 14), however, 3734.63 ha will be created as new Proper sites to host these species due to the change that is specifically expected to the southeast of the reserve as a result of the increase in the planet's temperature. Implications. Results allow elaborating recommendations for adaptation to climate change and reducing future vulnerability. Conclusions. Due to the global importance that it represents for humanity and the complexity of the factors that influence the problem, a greater number of studies are necessary that contribute to a better understanding and contribute to the identification of risks and threats to generate timely adaptation strategies, mitigation and slowdown to the potential impacts of climate change. © 2021 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

These events have influenced the evolutionary history of numerous freshwater fishes in the region. Nonetheless, recent studies have shown that life-history traits and ecological characteristics of species may influence dispersal capabilities and the degree of genetic connectivity. Goodea (Cyprinodontiformes: Goodeidae) is one of the most widely distributed and environmentally tolerant genera of goodeids. In this study, the authors analysed variation in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to evaluate the phylogeographic relationships, genetic structure, genetic diversity and demographic history of Goodea from across its distribution range. They found low genetic differentiation and identified shared haplotypes among several regions. Geographic segregation was found in samples southwest and northeast of the Lower Lerma region, with some internal isolated groups showing phylogeographic differentiation and unique haplotypes. The AMOVA best explained genetic structure when grouped by haplogroups rather than when grouped by recognized biogeographic regions. Several regions showed null genetic diversity, raising the possibility of dispersal mediated by humans. Finally, Bayesian Skyline Plot analysis showed a population expansion for the Southwest haplogroup, except for the Armería population and sub-group II of the Northeast haplogroup. All this suggests a recent colonization of Goodea atripinnis throughout some of the biogeographic regions currently inhabited by this species. © 2020 Fisheries Society of the British Isles","<b>Predicting metabolic reaction networks with Perturbation-Theory Machine Learning (PTML) models<\/b><br><br>Background: Checking the connectivity (structure) of complex Metabolic Reaction Networks (MRNs) models proposed for new microorganisms with promising properties is an important goal for chemical biology. Objective: In principle, we can perform a hand-on checking (Manual Curation). However, this is a challenging task due to the high number of combinations of pairs of nodes (possible metabolic reactions). Results: The CPTML linear model obtained using the LDA algorithm is able to discriminate nodes (metabolites) with the correct assignation of reactions from incorrect nodes with values of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity in the range of 85-100% in both training and external validation data series. Methods: In this work, we used Combinatorial Perturbation Theory and Machine Learning techniques to seek a CPTML model for MRNs >40 organisms compiled by Barabasis’ group. First, we quantified the local structure of a very large set of nodes in each MRN using a new class of node index called Markov linear indices fk. Next, we calculated CPT operators for 150000 combinations of query and reference nodes of MRNs. Last, we used these CPT operators as inputs of different ML algorithms. Conclusion: Meanwhile, PTML models based on Bayesian network, J48-Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms were identified as the three best non-linear models with accuracy greater than 97.5%.

It is supposedly fed by a huge magmatic chamber below the caldera. For studying the Chalupas magmatic chamber, the tomographic models obtained by a Tarantola-Valette inversion and studied previously in the entire Ecuadorian region were used. The theoretical basis of the tomography method based on a Bayesian solution of the inverse problem is introduced. The process of the inverse problem regularization is obtained by an L-curve scheme to achieve an optimal solution. The seismic tomography images zoomed in the Chalupas region are well correlated with the main geological terranes and faults documented for the basement of Eastern Cordillera. Based on the tomographic images obtained, it can be assumed that there is not a magmatic chamber of considerable magnitude placed close to the surface underneath the Chalupas Caldera, since it does not present seismic and tomographic evidence to be able to assume a possible volcanic eruption before long. Furthermore, the images allow identifying that the seismic and thermal activity is located beneath the Cotopaxi Volcano as a vertical anomaly beneath the Northeast of Cotopaxi Volcano that corresponds to the phreatomagmatic activity observed in 2015. © 2021, Escola de Minas.

The research began with the identification and selection of drivers and emulation tools currently used in SDN. Then it is proposed to design and implement a test scenario based on evaluation metrics. The proposed system is based on learning a Bayesian network from the data extracted and processed from an SDN, looking for causal relationships between data values and the state of the network. To emulate the operation of a real SDN, a simulation has been designed with several linked scale-free networks, in which various types of traffic have been injected. The Bayesian network will be used later to diagnose new failures introduced into the network, reasoning with the data extracted from it.

Previous global investigations of mammal functional diversity have relied on range maps instead of observational data to determine community composition. We test the effects of species pools, habitat heterogeneity, primary productivity and human disturbance on the functional diversity (dispersion and richness) of mammal communities using the largest standardized tropical forest camera trap monitoring system, the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network. We use occupancy values derived from the camera trap data to calculate occupancy-weighted functional diversity and use Bayesian generalized linear regression to determine the effects of multiple predictors. Mammal community functional dispersion increased with primary productivity, while functional richness decreased with human-induced local extinctions and was significantly lower in Madagascar than other tropical regions. The significant positive relationship between functional dispersion and productivity was evident only when functional dispersion was weighted by species' occupancies. Thus, observational data from standardized monitoring can reveal the drivers of mammal communities in ways that are not readily apparent from range map-based studies. The positive association between occupancy-weighted functional dispersion of tropical forest mammal communities and primary productivity suggests that unique functional traits may be more beneficial in more productive ecosystems and may allow species to persist at higher abundances. © 2021 The Authors.","<b>Parameter estimation for sars-cov-2 model in ecuador in presence of uncertainty<\/b><br><br>In this article we present the mathematical compartmental SARS-CoV-2 model, with asymptomatic patients, used by the Research Center on Mathematical Modelling (MODEMAT) to study the spread of the virus in Ecuador, as well as the developed Bayesian variational approach to estimate the model parameters, under uncertainty of the observed data.

Recent studies on foraging strategies show a higher complexity than previously thought due to intraspecific variability. To reliably identify foraging strategies and describe the different foraging niches they allow individual animals to realize, high-resolution multivariate approaches which consider individual variation are required. Here we dive into the foraging strategies of Galápagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), a tropical predator confronted with substantial annual variation in sea surface temperature. This affects prey abundance, and El Niño events, expected to become more frequent and severe with climate change, are known to have dramatic effects on sea lions. This study used high-resolution measures of depth, GPS position and acceleration collected from 39 lactating sea lion females to analyze their foraging strategies at an unprecedented level of detail using a novel combination of automated broken stick algorithm, hierarchical cluster analysis and individually fitted multivariate hidden Markov models. We found three distinct foraging strategies (pelagic, benthic, and night divers), which differed in their horizontal, vertical and temporal distribution, most likely corresponding to different prey species, and allowed us to formulate hypotheses with regard to adaptive values under different environmental scenarios. We demonstrate the advantages of our multivariate approach and inclusion of individual variation to reliably gain a deeper understanding of the adaptive value and ecological relevance of foraging strategies of marine predators in dynamic environments. © 2021, The Author(s).","<b>A novel Adam approach related to Decoupled Weight Decay (AdamL)<\/b><br><br>The use of optimizers makes it possible to reduce losses during the learning process of a neural network. Currently there are some types of optimizers whose effectiveness has already been proven, an example of this is Adam. Adam is an extension to Stochastic Gradient Decent that makes use of Momentum and Adaptive Learning to converge faster. An interesting alternative to complement the Adam's work is the addition of weight decay. This is done to decouple the weight decay from the gradient-based update. Some attempts have been developed previously, however its correct operation has not been keenly proven. In this work, a weight decay decoupling alternative is presented and acutely analyzed. The algorithm's convergence is mathematically verified and its operation too through the use of a Convolutional Encoder-Decoder network and the application of strategies for error reduction. The AdamL operation is verified by the achievement of a proper Temperature Forecast with a percentage error lower than 4.5%. It can be seen too that the forecast error deepens around noon but it does not exceed 1.47°C. © 2021 IEEE.","<b>A novel Encoder-Decoder structure for Time Series analysis based on Bayesian Uncertainty reduction<\/b><br><br>In the present work, a novel Convolutional LSTM Encoder-Decoder structure for the implementation of Weather Forecast for the Andean city of Quito is presented.

The aforementioned stages are combined to obtain 4 error metrics per hour. The prediction is done in base of acquired data from a network of Automatic Weather Stations. The results show that the Convolutional Encoder-Decoder structure with a dropout probability of 0.05 and a model precision equal to 0.1 performs better than a LSTM model, LSTM Stacked model or ARIMA models reaching a maximum error of 1.03 °C.

Due to the inability to record these events, systems cannot make the best decisions. In this sense, it is necessary to account for these losses to learn policies that allow inventory to be managed automatically. In this work, reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to an inventory management problem with unobserved losses. To do so, an inventory level inference model that considers unobserved losses was used. This solution does not depend on any distribution assumptions over sales and unobserved losses, but rather it estimates the distributions solely from observations and inputs of the system. During training, the model learns the transition and observation functions as distributions over inventory levels. The model simultaneously accounts state uncertainty and computes beliefs over inventory states. After the model is trained, it can be combined with a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, such as Q-learning, to determine a policy for the inventory management. This policy can be used as automated system for the management of the inventory. The results suggests that this system can improve the inventory management performance by reducing the uncertainty of inventory levels without specifying the transition and observation distributions. © 2021 IEEE.","<b>Stable isotope analysis reveals partitioning in prey use by Kajikia audax (Istiophoridae), Thunnus albacares, Katsuwonus pelamis, and Auxis spp. (Scombridae) in the Eastern Tropical Pacific of Ecuador<\/b><br><br>Kajikia audax, Thunnus albacares, Katsuwonus pelamis, and Auxis spp. occupy high and middle-level trophic positions in the food web. They represent important sources for fisheries in Ecuador. Despite their ecological and economic importance, studies on pelagic species in Ecuador are scarce. This study uses stable isotope analysis to assess the trophic ecology of these species, and to determine the contribution of prey to the predator tissue. Isotope data was used to test the hypothesis that medium-sized pelagic fish species have higher δ15N values than those of the prey they consumed, and that there is no overlap between their δ13C and δ15N values. Results showed higher δ15N values for K. audax, followed by T. albacares, Auxis spp. and K. pelamis, which indicates that the highest position in this food web is occupied by K. audax. The stable isotope Bayesian ellipses demonstrated that on a long time-scale, these species do not compete for food sources. Moreover, δ15N values were different between species and they decreased with a decrease in predator size. © 2021 The Authors.","<b>Precise Temporal P300 Detection in Brain Computer Interface EEG Signals Using a Long-Short Term Memory<\/b><br><br>Event-Related Potentials (ERP) detection is a latent problem in the clinical, neuroscience, and engineering fields. It is an open challenge that contributes to achieving more accurate and adaptable Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). The state-of-the-art typically uses simple classifiers based on Discriminant Analysis due to their little computational demand. Some more recent approaches have started using Deep Learning techniques, but these do not provide any temporal information and rarely focus on detecting the P300 at sample level in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which would improve the Information Transfer Rate in BCIs. In other research areas, recurrent neural networks have shown high performance in those tasks that require online responses. We propose a new methodology, based on Long-Short Term Memory networks, in a sample level forecast to predict the P300 signal continuously. We get a slight improvement concerning the standard procedure, typically Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis, and we also show that the model predicts the occurrence of the P300 ERP at sample level in EEG signals. This brings us the possibility of evaluating the inherent variation between subjects. Our approach contributes to more agile and adaptable BCIs development, going further in the real-life usage of BCIs. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>P300 Characterization Through Granger Causal Connectivity in the Context of Brain-Computer Interface Technologies<\/b><br><br>The analysis of connectivity in brain networks has been widely researched and it has been shown that certain cognitive processes require the integration of distributed brain areas. Functional connectivity attempts to statistically quantify the interdependence between these brain areas. In this paper, we propose an analysis of functional connectivity in the Event-Related Potential (ERP) context, more specifically on the P300 component using the Granger Causality measure. To this end, we propose a methodology that consists in quantifying the causality in the P300 and non-P300 signals in the context of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Causality is calculated using two approaches: i) using standard electrodes and, ii) using electrodes selected using Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis and sequential forward electrode selection (BLDA-FS). Based on this analysis, it is shown that the Granger Causality metric is valid to show a significant connectivity difference between P300 and non-P300 signals. The electrodes selected using BLDA-FS were found to be more discriminative in this regard. Studying functional connectivity using Granger Causality allowed us to identify the changes in connectivity detected during the presence of a target stimulus compared to a non-target stimulus. This additional information about the connectivity differences found can be incorporated as a new feature in further studies, allowing for better detection of the P300 signal and consequently improving the performance of P300-based BCIs. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>A Fine Dry-Electrode Selection to Characterize Event-Related Potentials in the Context of BCI<\/b><br><br>A brain-computer interface (BCI) detects brain activity and converts it to external commands, facilitating the interaction with external devices. One way to implement a BCI is through event-related potentials (ERP), which are positive or negative voltage deflections detected by electroencephalography (EEG) through conductive electrodes. A very promising technology of dry electrodes has been used in recent years, which is much easier and faster to install; useful also for daily life applications. But the disadvantage is that its signal-to-noise ratio is lower compared to traditional wet electrodes technology. Thus, we hypothesized that an appropriate selection of dry electrodes allows the recovery of much more information than traditional standard electrodes and therefore improves the BCI performance. This work shows the importance of electrode selection to obtain a better detection of the ERPs of the EEG signal with a minimum number of electrodes in a personalized manner. To illustrate this problem, we designed a BCI experiment based on P300-ERPs with a dry electrodes wireless EEG system and we evaluated its performance with two electrode selection methodologies designed for this purpose in 12 subjects. The experimental analysis of this work shows that our electrode selection methodology allows the P300-ERPs to be detected with greater precision than a standard electrode set choice. Besides, this minimum electrode selection methodology allows dealing with the well-known problem of inter- and intrasubject variability of the EEG signal, thus customizing the optimal selection of electrodes for each individual. This work contributes to the design of more friendly BCIs through a reduction in the number of electrodes, thus promoting more precise, comfortable, and lightweight equipment for real-life BCI applications. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>Proposal for a Platform Based on Artificial Vision for the Identification and Classification of Ceramic Tiles<\/b><br><br>It is proposed to develop a prototype platform based on artificial vision that allows us to identify the defects that ceramic tiles have, with which we can classify them according to their quality.

Two stochastic models for an estimate the states and parameters are considered, the parameters and states describe physical measure (associated with the price) and risk-neutral measure (associated with the markets to futures), the price dynamics in the short-term through the reversion to the mean and volatility are determined, while that in the long term through markets to futures. Other characteristics such as seasonal patterns, price spikes, marketdependent volatilities, and non-seasonality can also be observed. In the methodology, a parameter learning algorithm is used, specifically, three algorithms are proposed, that is the sequential Monte Carlo estimation (SMC) for state space models with unknown parameters: the first method is considered a particle filter that is based on the sampling algorithm of sequential importance with resampling (SISR).

The increasing prevalence of this pest in Spanish vineyards has been detected since 1990. In this study, the relationship between the climate and the actual distribution of the beetle was analysed, as well as how this distribution might change in the future according to several climate change models. The methodology was based on predictive models (SDM; species distribution modelling) using climate variables as explanatory factors, although the relationships were not necessarily causal. Maxent was used as the SDM method. The current climatic niche was calculated, and the actual potential distribution area was estimated. The relationships between the climate variables and the species probability of the presence were projected to various future climate change scenarios. The main conclusions reached were that climate change will favour the expansion of X. arvicola and that the potential infestation zones will be extended significantly. Although the results, because they were based on hypothetical climate frameworks that are under constant revision, were not conclusive, they should be taken into consideration when defining future strategies in the wine industry. © 2021 Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

Objective: To estimate the epidemiological profile of pediatric patients with COVID-19, as well as their clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics. Materials and methods: A living systemic review was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus and SciELO databases. Observational studies describing clinical, radiological, and laboratory characteristics of pediatric patients with COVID-19 and published between January 1, 2020, and July 20, 2020, were considered for the search; there were no language restrictions. Government, epidemiological, and pre-print papers were also considered. Meta-analyses of single proportion (frequentist approach) and two proportions (Bayesian method) were carried out. The study registration and protocol are available at https://osf.io/y43wm and https://osf.io/r8ktv, respectively. Results: 13 studies, with a total of 9 152 patients, were retrieved. The Bayesian meta-analysis reported that males are more affected by the disease: OR 1.24 (HDI95%: 1.09-1.4). The proportion results calculated by means of the frequentist meta-analysis are: 52% cough (95%CI: 50-55), 0% death (95%CI: 0-0.1), 16% high aspartate transaminase levels (95%CI: 13-19), and 60% lung changes observed in chest X-ray (95%CI: 57-64). Conclusions: Based on the current data, it is not possible to describe accurately the clinical and ep-idemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in the pediatric population. However, evidence suggests that males are more affected by the disease and that lung alterations in imaging studies are more frequent than clinical signs such as cough and fever. Laboratory test results are not conclusive and show that different organs and systems of the human body may be affected by SARS-CoV-2. The results reported here must be compared to prospective controlled studies conducted in larger sam-ples and a more rigorous design. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

We used isotope analysis of blue whale skin strata (n = 621) and potential prey (n = 300) to examine their migratory and foraging strategies in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Our results suggest that most whales in the northeast Pacific use a mixed income and capital breeding strategy, and use the California Current Ecosystem as their primary summer-fall foraging ground. A subset of individuals exhibited migratory plasticity and spend most of the year in the Gulf of California or Costa Rica Dome, two regions believed to be their primary winter-spring breeding grounds. Isotope data also revealed that whales in the southern Eastern Tropical Pacific generally do not forage in the northeast Pacific, which suggests a north-south population structure with a boundary near the equator. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","<b>A biogeographic–ecological approach to disentangle reticulate evolution in the Triatoma phyllosoma species group (Heteroptera: Triatominae), vectors of Chagas disease<\/b><br><br>Introgression and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) are two of the main sources of gene-tree incongruence; both can confound the assessment of phylogenetic relationships among closely related species. The Triatoma phyllosoma species group is a clade of partially co-distributed and cross-fertile Chagas disease vectors. Despite previous efforts, the phylogeny of this group remains unresolved, largely because of substantial gene-tree incongruence. Here, we sequentially address introgression and ILS to provide a robust phylogenetic hypothesis for the T. phyllosoma species group. To identify likely instances of introgression prior to molecular scrutiny, we assessed biogeographic data and information on fertility of inter-specific crosses. We first derived a few explicit hybridization hypotheses by considering the degree of spatial overlap within each species pair. Then, we assessed the plausibility of these hypotheses in the light of each species pair's cross-fertility. Using this contextual information, we evaluated mito-nuclear (cyt b, ITS-2) gene-tree incongruence and found evidence suggesting introgression within two species pairs. Finally, we modeled ILS using a Bayesian multispecies coalescent approach and either (a) a “complete” dataset with all the specimens in our sample, or (b) a “filtered” dataset without putatively introgressed specimens. The “filtered tree” had higher posterior-probability support, as well as more plausible topology and divergence times, than the “complete tree.” Detecting and filtering out introgression and modeling ILS allowed us to derive an improved phylogenetic hypothesis for the T. phyllosoma species group. Our results illustrate how biogeographic and ecological-reproductive contextual information can help clarify the systematics and evolution of recently diverged taxa prone to introgression and ILS. © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","<b>Teloschistaceae (lichenized Ascomycota) from the Galapagos Islands: A phylogenetic revision based on morphological, anatomical, chemical, and molecular data<\/b><br><br>The lichen family Teloschistaceae from the Galapagos is revised. Most of the species belong to the Caloplacoideae, two to Teloschistoideae and a few to Xanthorioideae, three subfamilies not validly published, which is remedied here. Four different datasets were analyzed using Bayesian inference. For the bulk of the species, a combined dataset of nrITS, nrLSU and mrSSU was analyzed. Additionally, three analyses were performed using nrITS to further investigate phylogenetic relationships within and between species in each subfamily, and in the genera Xanthomendoza and Squamulea. Four new genera are described: Lacrima, Oceanoplaca, Phaeoplaca, Sucioplaca. Twenty-four species are reported, of which ten are new to science: Caloplaca nigra, Lacrima galapagoensis, Oceanoplaca chemoisidiosa, O. sideritoides, Phaeoplaca tortuca, Squamulea chelonia, S. humboldtiana, S. osseophila, S. oceanica, and Xanthomendoza leoncita. Several new combinations are proposed and three species of Xanthomendoza are reduced to synonymy. Several new combinations and species placed into synonymy do not occur in the Galapagos, but are treated as a consequence of our taxonomic revision. Morphology, anatomy, secondary chemistry, distribution and molecular phylogenetic affiliation are presented for each species and a key is provided. Eight different chemical patterns are quantitatively described based on HPLC analyses. The new genus Lacrima includes L. galapagoensis, a species without vegetative propagules, and two densely isidiate species, L. epiphora and L. aphanotripta that are morphologically similar to 'Caloplaca' wrightii. The only species of Galapagos Teloschistaceae that contains xanthones is placed into Huneckia. Oceanoplaca includes two species with the new anthraquinone isidiosin, O. isidiosa and O. chemoisidiosa, while a third species, O. sideritoides, does not contain this secondary metabolite. Phaeoplaca camptidia has previously been reported from Galapagos, but our phylogenetic analysis suggests that it is a new species, here named P. tortuca. An isolated position is occupied by 'Caloplaca' diplacia, which we place in it its own monotypic genus Sucioplaca. Some Galapagos Teloschistaceae can be considered a 'residue' of unresolved Caloplaca s.l., i.e. the corticolous C. floridana is possibly related to the saxicolous C. nigra, while C. cupulifera can currently not be placed. Squamulea remains particularly problematic and includes S. phyllidizans, that is nested among otherwise unresolved Squamulea species. Based on molecular data, S. phyllidizans is close to 'Huriella'. 'Huriella' flakusii, described from Peru, is confirmed to occur in the Galapagos and the genus is reduced to synonymy with Squamulea. The Squamulea squamosa/subsoluta group remains largely unresolved, but the new species S. chelonia, S. humboldtiana, S. oceanica, and S. osseophila are phylogenetically distinct. Foliose Teloschistaceae are represented only by one species, described as Xanthomendoza leoncita, while the only fruticose species, Teloschistes chrysophthalmus and T. flavicans, are cosmopolitan. © 2020 W.

Methods: We identified clinical trials posted on the ClinicalTrials.gov database focused on Oncology trials with a Bayesian approach in their design. Differences in study characteristics such as design, study phase, randomization, masking, purpose of study, main outcomes, gender, age and funding involvement according to Bayesian approach were assessed using Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests. Results: We identified 225 studies with Bayesian components in their design addressing oncological diseases. The most common designs were Bayesian Toxicity Monitoring (26.4%), Model-based designs (36%) Model-assisted designs (8%). Statistical methods such as Bayesian logistic regression model (59.4%), Bayesian piecewise exponential survival regression (10.9%) and the Continual reassessment method (9.4%) were the most used. Conclusions: Bayesian trials are more common in the early phases of drug development specifically in phase II trials (43.6%). Cancer institutes or Hospitals funded most of the studies retrieved.

These regions are home to 40% of the world’s population, which is projected to increase to over 50% by 2030 under a remarkable climate variability scenario often exacerbated by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and other climate teleconnections. In the tropics, ecohydrological conditions are typically under the influence of complex land-ocean-atmosphere interactions that produce a dynamic cycling of mass and energy reflected in a clear partition of water fluxes. Here, we present a review of 7 years of a concerted and continuous water stable isotope monitoring across Costa Rica, including key insights learned, main methodological advances and limitations (both in experimental designs and data analysis), potential data gaps, and future research opportunities with a humid tropical perspective. The uniqueness of the geographic location of Costa Rica within the mountainous Central America Isthmus, receiving moisture inputs from the Caribbean Sea (windward) and the Pacific Ocean (complex leeward topography), and experiencing strong ENSO events, poses a clear advantage for the use of isotopic variations to underpin key drivers in ecohydrological responses. In a sequential approach, isotopic variations are analyzed from moisture transport, rainfall generation, and groundwater/surface connectivity to Bayesian and rainfall-runoff modeling. The overarching goal of this review is to provide a robust humid tropical example with a progressive escalation from common water isotope observations to more complex modeling outputs and applications to enhance water resource management in the tropics. © Copyright © 2020 Sánchez-Murillo, Esquivel-Hernández, Birkel, Correa, Welsh, Durán-Quesada, Sánchez-Gutiérrez and Poca.","<b>An approach to automatic classification of Culicoides species by learning the wing morphology<\/b><br><br>Fast and accurate identification of biting midges is crucial in the study of Culicoides-borne diseases. In this work, we propose a two-stage method for automatically analyzing Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) species. First, an image preprocessing task composed of median and Wiener filters followed by equalization and morphological operations is used to improve the quality of the wing image in order to allow an adequate segmentation of particles of interest. Then, the segmentation of the zones of interest inside the biting midge wing is made using the watershed transform. The proposed method is able to produce optimal feature vectors that help to identify Culicoides species. A database containing wing images of C. obsoletus, C. pusillus, C. foxi, and C. insignis species was used to test its performance. Feature relevance analysis indicated that the mean of hydraulic radius and eccentricity were relevant for the decision boundary between C. obsoletus and C. pusillus species. In contrast, the number of particles and the mean of the hydraulic radius was relevant for deciding between C. foxi and C. insignis species. Meanwhile, for distinguishing among the four species, the number of particles and zones, and the mean of circularity were the most relevant features. The linear discriminant analysis classifier was the best model for the three experimental classification scenarios previously described, achieving averaged areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98, 0.90, and 0.96, respectively. © 2020 Venegas et al.

Currently, Floridosentis includes two species, F. mugilis, distributed in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic Ocean coast, and F. pacifica, restricted to the Pacific Ocean coast. The aim of this study was to explore the species limit of both species of the genus Floridosentis, collected in 37 localities in eight countries: Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Venezuela. We sequenced 253 specimens to build a comprehensive dataset for three genes: the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox 1) from mitochondrial DNA, the internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2 including the 5.8S gene (ITS region), and the D2 + D3 domains of the large subunit (LSU) of nuclear DNA. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses with the cox 1 and concatenated (cox 1 + ITS+LSU) datasets were conducted. Two species delimitation methods were implemented, the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD), and Bayesian species delimitation (BPP), plus a haplotype network inferred with 253 specimens, allowing us to validate two nominal species of Floridosentis., F. mugilis, plus one linage distributed in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic Ocean coast, and F. pacifica, plus two additional lineages distributed along the Pacific Ocean coast. All these lineages are shared by both species of mullet (Mugil curema and M. cephalus). The currents in the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, in combination with the biology of the definitive hosts, have played a key role in the distribution of the two nominal species and of the three lineages of Floridosentis across the Americas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Design optimization for reliability improvement in microgrids with wind – tidal – photovoltaic generation<\/b><br><br>Distributed generation is essential for smart distribution systems. This prospect mainly depends on the efficient use of renewable resources. Therefore, it is compelling to provide an optimum design framework that allows a thorough modeling to select the most convenient size, location, and renewable energy combination that maximize system reliability on a distribution network. This paper presents an optimization-based framework to design a distributed generation system by incorporating an optimal reliability assessment with wind, solar, and tidal energies. The network planning exercise considers the stochastic nature of the network's state by including time-series models and hourly-based analysis to accurately determine the reliability indexes. Historical meteorological data has been used to model and deploy a set of renewable energy distributed generators which maximize reliability in a 37-bus primary-distribution network. Due to the probabilistic modeling of the system's components, a Sequential Monte-Carlo simulation is used to manage reliability evaluation at the network level. Although large reductions on energy-not-supplied are expected, it is shown that cost and other performance indexes do not follow the same trend, and project selection requires some compromise between cost and performance. © 2020","<b>Molecular data supports monophyly of Triatoma dispar complex within genus Triatoma<\/b><br><br>The genus Triatoma contains numerous species, principal or secondary vectors of Chagas disease, which have been included in the three main lineages of Triatomini tribe based on morphological and biogeographical characteristics: North American, South American, and T. dispar complex. The three members of the T. dispar complex are distributed in Ecuador. This complex has been scarcely studied through molecular approaches, and the taxonomic position of this complex is not confirmed. In this study, we explored the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Triatoma, including five species from North and Central America, six from South America, and the three species belonging to the T. dispar complex. Partial sequences of four mitochondrial genes (Cyt b, COII, 16S-rRNA, 12S-rRNA) and two nuclear genes (18S-rRNA, ITS2) were obtained from 74 specimens. Phylogenetic trees were built with concatenated and single sequences through maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP), and Bayesian methods. The trees built using concatenated sequences showed three main branches (clusters) highly supported by significant bootstrap values; the T. dispar complex appeared as a monophyletic group separate from species of North and Central American origin and South American origin. On the contrary, for each gene tree, the three main clusters were not always significantly supported, mostly because genetic information is dramatically reduced when a single gene is considered. Consequently, concatenation of genes gives relevant results and is highly recommended for further in-depth examination of the relationships of several species and complexes of triatomines that remain unresolved. Moreover, our current molecular data fully revealed the division of genus Triatoma into at least three main genetic groups. © 2020","<b>Global ecological footprint and spatial dependence between countries<\/b><br><br>The Ecological Footprint is defined as the ecological impact caused by human activities, such as agriculture, fishing, raising livestock, and building infrastructure. A high level of Ecological Footprint index is linked to high consumption of natural resources, which causes a negative impact on the environment. Few studies analyze the Ecological Footprint and its determinants considering the effects of neighboring countries. Therefore, we research whether the Ecological Footprints of 158 countries are spatially correlated, as well as their determinants. We retrieve the data from the Global Footprint Network and the World Bank for ten years (2007–2016) and apply a dynamic spatial Durbin model. Unlike previous studies of spatial dependence, we estimate the direct, indirect and total effects of biocapacity, trade openness and GDP on the Ecological Footprint in the short-run and long-run horizons. Our results detect significant spatial effects. We find that biocapacity, trade openness and GDP increase the Ecological Footprint of countries, however, the former two exhibit significant indirect effects in both horizons while the latter one display significant direct effects. These effects account for a significant share of the variation of the Ecological Footprint.

Additionally, rural livelihoods largely depend on short-term migrants traveling across borders via the Amazon’s river networks to work in extractive industries, such as logging. As a result, there is likely considerable spillover across country borders, particularly along the border between Peru and Ecuador. This border region exhibits a steep gradient of transmission intensity, with Peru having a much higher incidence of malaria than Ecuador. In this paper, we integrate 13 years of weekly malaria surveillance data collected at the district level in Peru and the canton level in Ecuador, and leverage hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal regression models to identify the degree to which malaria transmission in Ecuador is influenced by transmission in Peru. We find that increased case incidence in Peruvian districts that border the Ecuadorian Amazon is associated with increased incidence in Ecuador. Our results highlight the importance of coordinated malaria control across borders. © 2020 by the authors.

Low-cost sensor technologies have emerged as an affordable solution to cope with this deficiency. However, since low-cost sensors are built with low-cost materials, they are prone to errors, gaps, bias, and noise. These problems need to be solved before data can be used to support research or decision making. Addressing lack of reliability in low-cost sensor data is a complex challenge that is still under research over several lines (e.g. accuracy estimation of low-cost sensor data). Current approaches in this line involve modeling, bias-correction, and more recently, data fusion methods relying on high-resolution air quality computational models. Overall, accuracy estimation can be reduced to a modeling problem. The focus of this work is studying, testing, and comparing suitable approaches for handling point-referenced spatio-temporal sensor data, particularly classical spatial models, spatio-temporal models, and popular machine learning methods. Among these approaches, Bayesian hierarchical models have a special consideration given the attention they have drawn during the last fifteen years. The benchmark supporting this comparison study is a real-life dataset made up of daily ozone observations taken from the USA Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and meteorological variables extracted from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project (NNRP). The main contributions of this work are: (1) a systematic comparison of three kinds of models, using a 10-fold cross-validation exercise; and (2) a feature engineering method to create covariates meant to harness spatially correlated observations of point-referenced sensor data. © 2020 IEEE.","<b>Multi-pathway human exposure risk assessment using Bayesian modeling at the historically largest mercury mining district<\/b><br><br>The largest mercury (Hg) mining district in the world is located in Almadén (Spain), with well-known environmental impacts in the surrounding ecosystem. However, the impact of mercury on the health of the inhabitants of this area has not been documented accordingly. This study aims to carry out a probabilistic human health risk assessment using Bayesian modeling to estimate the non-carcinogenic risk related to Hg through multiple exposure pathways. Samples of vegetables, wild mushrooms, fish, soil, water, and air were analyzed, and adult residents were randomly surveyed to adjust the risk models to the specific population data. On the one hand, the results for the non-carcinogenic risk based on Hazard Quotient (HQ) showed unacceptable risk levels through ingestion of Hg-contaminated vegetables and fish, with HQ values 20 and 3 times higher, respectively, than the safe exposure threshold of 1 for the 97.5th percentile. On the other hand, ingestion of mushrooms, dermal contact with soil, ingestion of water, dermal contact with water and inhalation of air, were below the safety limit for the 97.5th percentile, and did not represent a risk to the health of residents. In addition, the probabilistic approach was compared with the conservative deterministic approach, and similar results were obtained. This is the first study conducted in Almadén, which clearly reveals the high levels of human health risk to which the population is exposed due to the legacy of two millennia of Hg mining. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","<b>The Relative Role of Climate Variation and Control Interventions on Malaria Elimination Efforts in El Oro, Ecuador: A Modeling Study<\/b><br><br>Malaria is a vector-borne disease of significant public health concern. Despite widespread success of many elimination initiatives, elimination efforts in some regions of the world have stalled. Barriers to malaria elimination include climate and land use changes, such as warming temperatures and urbanization, which can alter mosquito habitats. Socioeconomic factors, such as political instability and regional migration, also threaten elimination goals. This is particularly relevant in areas where local elimination has been achieved and consequently surveillance and control efforts are dwindling and are no longer a priority. Understanding how environmental change, impacts malaria elimination has important practical implications for vector control and disease surveillance strategies. It is important to consider climate change when monitoring the threat of malaria resurgence due to socioeconomic influences. However, there is limited assessment of how the combination of climate variation, interventions and socioeconomic pressures influence long-term trends in malaria transmission and elimination efforts. In this study, we used Bayesian hierarchical mixed models and malaria case data for a 29-year period to disentangle the impacts of climate variation and malaria control efforts on malaria risk in the Ecuadorian province of El Oro, which achieved local elimination in 2011. We found shifting patterns of malaria between rural and urban areas, with a relative increase of Plasmodium vivax in urbanized areas. Minimum temperature was an important driver of malaria seasonality and the association between warmer minimum temperatures and malaria incidence was greater for Plasmodium falciparum compared to P. vivax malaria. There was considerable heterogeneity in the impact of three chemical vector control measures on both P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria. We found statistically significant associations between two of the three measures [indoor residual spraying (IRS) and space spraying] and a reduction in malaria incidence, which varied between malaria type. We also found environmental suitability for malaria transmission is increasing in El Oro, which could limit future elimination efforts if malaria is allowed to re-establish. Our findings have important implications for understanding environmental obstacles to malaria elimination and highlights the importance of designing and sustaining elimination efforts in areas that remain vulnerable to resurgence. © Copyright © 2020 Fletcher, Stewart-Ibarra, Sippy, Carrasco-Escobar, Silva, Beltran-Ayala, Ordoñez, Adrian, Sáenz, Drakeley, Jones and Lowe.","<b>Virtual control volume approach to the study of climate causal flows: Identification of humidity and wind pathways of influence on rainfall in Ecuador<\/b><br><br>Unraveling the relationship between humidity, wind, and rainfall is vitally important to understand the dynamics of water vapor transport. In recent years, the use of causal networks to identify causal flows has gained much ground in the field of climatology to provide new insights about physical processes and hypothesize previously unknown ones. In this paper, the concept of a virtual control volume is proposed, which resembles the Eulerian description of a vector field, but is based on causal flows instead. A virtual control surface is used to identify the influence of surrounding climatic processes on the control volume (i.e., the study region). Such an influence is characterized by using a causal inference method that gives information about its direction and strength. The proposed approach was evaluated by inferring and spatially delineating areas of influence of humidity and wind on the rainfall of Ecuador. It was possible to confirm known patterns of influence, such as the influence of the Pacific Ocean on the coast and the influence of the Atlantic Ocean on the Amazon. Moreover, the approach was able to identify plausible new hypotheses, such as the influence of humidity on rainfall in the northern part of the boundary between the Andes and the Amazon, as well as the origin (the Amazon or the tropical Atlantic) and the altitude at which surrounding humidity and wind influence rainfall within the control volume. These hypotheses highlight the ability of the approach to exploit a large amount of scalar data and identify pathways of influence between climatic variables. © 2020 by the authors.","<b>Conditioned haptic perception for 3D localization of nodules in soft tissue palpation with a variable stiffness probe<\/b><br><br>This paper provides a solution for fast haptic information gain during soft tissue palpation using a Variable Lever Mechanism (VLM) probe.

Using knowledge obtained from past probing trials or Finite Element (FE) simulations, we implemented this likelihood conditioning in an autonomous palpation control strategy. Based on a recursive Bayesian inferencing framework, this new control strategy adapts the sweeping direction and the stiffness of the probe to detect abnormal stiff inclusions in soft tissues. This original control strategy for compliant palpation probes shows a sub-millimeter accuracy for the 3D localization of the nodules in a soft tissue phantom as well as a 100% reliability detecting the existence of nodules in a soft phantom. © 2020 Herzig et al.

Consequently, insights into ecosystem functioning in relation to exploitation are needed as a basis for socioeconomically acceptable mitigation of these impacts. A Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model is developed to link three major ecosystem services (ES), i.e. food production, water provision and ecotourism, and determine the effect of local agricultural practices and management on the ES in the Guayas Basin (Ecuador). Several data sources were integrated into the BBN model, including processed spatial data from primary and secondary sources, sampling and survey data, and expert knowledge. The model suggests that banana and sugar cane generate the highest yield but provide low ecotourism benefits. In contrast, cacao produces the lowest yields but contributes to better water quality. Scenario analyses suggest that environmental gains are possible by optimising the land use (LU) based on the edaphoclimatic requirements of crops. Moreover, the integration of LU optimisation with upscaling and farming intensification can allow for additional advantages in water provision and ecotourism while mitigating productivity losses. The BBN development approach can serve as a reference for other case studies, where data scarcity plays a limiting factor in the assessment of interactions between key ES. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Vastly underestimated species richness of Amazonian salamanders (Plethodontidae: Bolitoglossa) and implications about plethodontid diversification<\/b><br><br>We present data showing that the number of salamander species in Amazonia is vastly underestimated.

By including representatives of all known species of Amazonian Bolitoglossa, except for one, and 73% of the currently 132 recognized species of the genus, our dataset represents the broadest sample of Bolitoglossa species, specimens, and geographic localities studied to date. We performed phylogenetic analyses using parsimony with tree-alignment and maximum likelihood (ML) with similarity alignment, with indels as binary characters. Our optimal topologies were used to delimit lineages that we assigned to nominal species and candidate new species following criteria that maximize the consilience of the current species taxonomy, monophyly, gaps in branch lengths, genetic distances, and geographic distribution. We contrasted the results of our species-delimitation protocol with those of Automated Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) and multi-rate Poisson Tree Processes (mPTP). Finally, we inferred the historical biogeography of South American salamanders by dating the trees and using dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA). Our results revealed a clade including almost all Amazonian salamanders, with a topology incompatible with just the currently recognized nine species. Following our species-delimitation criteria, we identified 44 putative species in Amazonia. Both ABGD and mPTP inferred more species than currently recognized, but their numbers (23–49) and limits vary. Our biogeographic analysis suggested a stepping-stone colonization of the Amazonian lowlands from Central America through the Chocó and the Andes, with several late dispersals from Amazonia back into the Andes. These biogeographic events are temporally concordant with an early land bridge between Central and South America (~10–15 MYA) and major landscape changes in Amazonia during the late Miocene and Pliocene, such as the drainage of the Pebas system, the establishment of the Amazon River, and the major orogeny of the northern Andes. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Some simple bayesian classifier applied to learning<\/b><br><br>In this article, we propose the use of a new simple Bayes classifier (SBND) that quickly learns a Markov limit of the class variable to a network structure that relates the class variables and said limit.

The applicability of our method is shown for a large-scale (11.0 km) and time-demanding (9.14 hr for the period 2002–2013) 2-D morphodynamic sediment transport model of the Lower River Salzach and for three most sensitive input parameters (critical Shields parameter, grain roughness, and grain size distribution). Since Bayesian methods require a significant number of simulation runs, this work proposes to construct a surrogate model, here with the arbitrary polynomial chaos technique. The surrogate model is constructed from a limited set of runs (n=20) of the full complex sediment transport model. Then, Monte Carlo-based techniques for Bayesian calibration are used with the surrogate model (105 realizations in 4 hr). The results demonstrate that following Bayesian principles and iterative Bayesian updating of the surrogate model (10 iterations) enables to identify the most probable ranges of the three calibration parameters. Model verification based on the maximum a posteriori parameter combination indicates that the surrogate model accurately replicates the morphodynamic behavior of the sediment transport model for both calibration (RMSE = 0.31 m) and validation (RMSE = 0.42 m). Furthermore, it is shown that the surrogate model is highly effective in lowering the total computational time for Bayesian calibration, validation, and uncertainty analysis. As a whole, this provides more realistic calibration and validation of morphodynamic sediment transport models with quantified uncertainty in less time compared to conventional calibration procedures. ©2020.

Then, we explain how the realist approach can contribute to theory-based evaluation with multi-methods. We go through the process leading from the adoption of policy aims to the production of a policy outcome by a causal mechanism linking agenda setting to policy formulation, cross-sectorial coordination, political interplays, and this policy’s outcome. This hypothesis is then tested against a typology of policy instruments classified by the State resources. These instruments are hereby treated as expected empirical observations that provide an empirical basis to assess the theoretical process following a Bayesian logic. We eventually present a five-step protocol aimed at making realist policy evaluation easier, which includes process theorization and operationalization, empirical tests design, case selection and justification, congruence analysis, and deep within-case study. © The Author(s) 2020.","<b>Museomics Unveil the Phylogeny and Biogeography of the Neglected Juan Fernandez Archipelago Megalachne and Podophorus Endemic Grasses and Their Connection With Relict Pampean-Ventanian Fescues<\/b><br><br>Oceanic islands constitute natural laboratories to study plant speciation and biogeographic patterns of island endemics. Juan Fernandez is a southern Pacific archipelago consisting of three small oceanic islands located 600–700 km west of the Chilean coastline. Exposed to current cold seasonal oceanic climate, these 5.8–1 Ma old islands harbor a remarkable endemic flora. All known Fernandezian endemic grass species belong to two genera, Megalachne and Podophorus, of uncertain taxonomic adscription. Classical and modern classifications have placed them either in Bromeae (Bromus), Duthieinae, Aveneae/Poeae, or Loliinae (fine-leaved Festuca); however, none of them have clarified their evolutionary relationships with respect to their closest Festuca relatives. Megalachne includes four species, which are endemic to Masatierra (Robinson Crusoe island) (M. berteroniana and M. robinsoniana) and to Masafuera (Alejandro Selkirk island) (M. masafuerana and M. dantonii). The monotypic Podophorus bromoides is a rare endemic species to Masatierra which is only known from its type locality and is currently considered extinct. We have used museomic approaches to uncover the challenging evolutionary history of these endemic grasses and to infer the divergence and dispersal patterns from their ancestors. Genome skimming data were produced from herbarium samples of M. berteroniana and M. masafuerana, and the 164 years old type specimen of P. bromoides, as well as for a collection of 33 species representing the main broad- and fine-leaved Loliinae lineages. Paired-end reads were successfully mapped to plastomes and nuclear ribosomal cistrons of reference Festuca species and used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees. Filtered ITS and trnTLF sequences from these genomes were further combined with our large Loliinae data sets for accurate biogeographic reconstruction. Nuclear and plastome data recovered a strongly supported fine-leaved Fernandezian clade where Podophorus was resolved as sister to Megalachne. Bayesian divergence dating and dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis range evolution analyses estimated the split of the Fernandezian clade from its ancestral southern American Pampas-Ventanian Loliinae lineage in the Miocene-Pliocene transition, following a long distance dispersal from the continent to the uplifted volcanic palaeo-island of Santa Clara-Masatierra. Consecutive Pliocene-Pleistocene splits and a Masatierra-to-Masafuera dispersal paved the way for in situ speciation of Podophorus and Megalachne taxa. © Copyright © 2020 Moreno-Aguilar, Arnelas, Sánchez-Rodríguez, Viruel and Catalán.","<b>Phylo-biogeographical distribution of whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Insecta: Aleyrodidae) mitotypes in Ecuador<\/b><br><br>The Bemisia tabaci complex in Ecuador was studied with respect to phylogenetic relationships and eco-geographical distribution. Whitefly samples were collected from natural and agricultural environments in nine provinces of Ecuador (latitude, 2° N–5° S; longitude, 78°–81° W). Mitotypes were identified based on phylogenetic analysis of the 3′-mtCOI-tRNAleu region (832 bp) and corrected pairwise distance analysis. The distribution of mitotypes was modeled using MaxEnt, and their predicted niches were characterized according to environmental gradients. Four B. tabaci mitotypes were identified, of which three are endemic, herein ECU1–3, and the other is the introduced B mitotype. Mitotypes ECU1 (44%), ECU2 (0.74%), and ECU3 (1.47%) grouped in the American Tropics (AMTROP) species and diverged by as much as 10%, which was higher than previous estimates for the AMTROP clade of 7–8.6%. Although haplotypes of ECU1 and ECU2 are known from the American Tropics, this is the first report of the ECU3 mitotype, which may possibly be restricted to southern Ecuador. The distribution of the three ECU-endemic mitotypes spanned the high-altitude niches of the western slope of the Andes, rich in microclimates with variable temperature and humidity conditions. The non-endemic B mitotype (47%) occurred only in the irrigated cropping systems located in hot and/or dry-tropical ecological niches. Of the endemic mitotypes, ECU1 occupied the most ecological niches. Among variables contributing to ECU1 and B mitotype niche range assignments, the most significant to influence ecological range was rainfall. The B. tabaci endemic to Ecuador were more diverse with respect to mtCOI-tRNAleu sequence than previously known, and occupied distinct microclimate niches suggestive of ecological resilience. © 2020 The Authors.","<b>Trophic preferences of three pelagic fish inhabiting the Galapagos Marine Reserve: ecological inferences using multiple analyses<\/b><br><br>There is a great need to understand how resource interactions alter the functioning of ecosystems, where the selective elimination of pelagic fishes can lead to changes in food web structure. This work analyzes the trophic niches of three species of commercial importance in the Galapagos Marine Reserve, yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares (TA), skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis (KP), and wahoo, Acanthocybium solandri (AS), via multiple analyses. According to the prey-specific index of relative importance, the most important prey for TA was Dosidicus gigas, while for AS it was unidentified pelagic fish. Interspecific differences were found between the isotopic signatures of AS and those of TA and KP. The isotope mixing model provides evidence for some predominance of D. gigas in the diets of TA and KP, while the fishes Selar crumenophthalmus and Paranthias colonus contribute to the diet of AS. The stable isotope Bayesian ellipses show a high overlap between TA and KP, suggesting a similar use of resources and feeding areas, while the ellipse of AS does not overlap with that of the other species. Both AS and TA were present around the islands more commonly during the day, with a peak in detections in the morning for AS and a greater presence of TA throughout the afternoon; there were only a few detections of KP in the days immediately after tagging. In summary, the results of this study suggest a pelagic foraging strategy with differential consumption of prey between AS and the other species. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","<b>Phylodynamics of sunflower chlorotic mottle virus, an emerging pathosystem<\/b><br><br>Distribution and epidemiological patterns of sunflower chlorotic mottle virus (SCMoV) in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) growing areas in Argentina were studied from 2006 to 2017. The virus was detected exclusively in the Pampas region (Entre Ríos, Santa Fe, Córdoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires provinces). Phylodynamic analyses performed using the coat protein gene of SCMoV isolates from sunflower and weeds dated the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) back to 1887 (HPD95% = 1572–1971), which coincides with the dates of sunflower introduction in Argentina. The MRCA was located in the south of Buenos Aires province and was associated with sunflower host (posterior probability for the ancestral host, ppah = 0.98). The Bayesian phylodynamic analyses revealed the dispersal patterns of SCMoV, suggesting a link between natural host diversity, crop displacement by human activities and virus spread. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Body mass index in human gait for building risk assessment using graph theory<\/b><br><br>This article presents a comprehensive study of human physiology to determine the impact of body mass index (BMI) on human gait. The approach followed in this study consists of a mathematical model based on the centre of mass of the human body, the inertia of a person in motion and the human gait speed. Moreover, the study includes the representation of a building using graph theory and emulates the presence of a person inside the building when an emergency takes place. The optimal evacuation route is obtained using the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, and the evacuation time prediction is calculated using a Gaussian process model. Then, the risk of the building is quantified by using a non-sequential Monte Carlo simulation.

Undiagnosed faults in the machinery's components produce a high rate of unplanned stoppage of production processes that can even result in catastrophic consequences. Fault diagnosis in reciprocating compressors requires complex and time-consuming feature-extraction processes because typical fault diagnosers cannot deal directly with raw signals. In this paper, we streamline the deep learning and optimization algorithms for effective fault diagnosis on these machines. The proposed approach iteratively trains a group of long short-term memory (LSTM) models from a time-series representation of the vibration signals collected from a compressor. The hyperparameter search is guided by a Bayesian approach bounding the search space in each iteration. Our approach is applied to diagnose failures in intake/discharge valves on double-stage machinery. The fault-recognition accuracy of the best model reaches 93% after statistical selection between a group of candidate models. Additionally, a comparison with classical approaches, state-of-the-art deep learning-based fault-diagnosis approaches, and the LSTM-based model shows a remarkable improvement in performance by using the proposed approach. © 2019","<b>A novel strategy for dynamic identification in AC/DC microgrids based on ARX and Petri Nets<\/b><br><br>This paper presents a new hybrid strategy which allows the dynamic identification of AC/DC microgrids (MG) by using algorithms such as Auto-Regressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) and Petri Nets (PN). The proposed strategy demonstrated in this study serves to obtain a dynamic model of the DC MG in isolated or connected modes. Given the non-linear nature of the system under study, the methodology divides the whole system in a bank of linearized models at different stable operating points, coordinated by a PN state machine. The bank of models obtained in state space, together with an adequate selection of models, can capture and reflect the non-linear dynamic properties of the AD/DC MGs and the different systems that it composes. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been tested using the Matlab/Simulink simulation platform. © 2020 The Author(s)","<b>Genetic data support speciation between Panstrongylus howardi and Panstrongylus chinai, vectors of Chagas disease in Ecuador<\/b><br><br>Limited genetic data are currently available for three vectors of Chagas disease in Ecuador, Panstrongylus howardi, P. chinai, and P. rufotuberculatus. Previously regarded as mainly sylvatic, these species have been poorly studied. Recently, they have been more frequently reported in domiciles and peridomiciles and are now considered true secondary vectors of Chagas disease in a country where an estimated 200,000 people are infected by Trypanosoma cruzi, a causative agent of this disease. In order to fill this gap, we obtained DNA for sequencing from 53 insects belonging to these three species and mainly sampled from the two Ecuadorian provinces of Loja and Manabí. We used six mitochondrial loci (COI, COII, ND4, CytB, 16S, and 12S) and two nuclear ones (ITS2 and 18S). We interpreted the phylogenetic trees built with single and concatenated data through maximum likelihood, Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo, and maximum parsimony methods. We provide evidence that P. chinai and P. howardi are indeed two supported species closely related and derived from a common ancestor. Additionally, the phylogenetic position of P. rufotuberculatus was confirmed as being distant from P. chinai and P. howardi and clustered with Triatoma dimidiata, a species belonging to the Northern American Triatoma clade. © 2019","<b>Predict the magnitudes of seismic events using Bayesian methods<\/b><br><br>The phase spectrum is an important characteristic of earthquake motion. Although amplitude and phase spectrum is essential to simulate an earthquake motion, the arrival time of a wave component with frequency and the distribution width of the group delay time are related to the duration of the time history of the wave component, its modeling is much easier than direct modeling of phase spectrum. In this paper, a stochastic differential equation (SDE) was considered to simulate the group delay time (GDT) of earthquake ground motion. A brief review of probabilistic Bayesian methods (Monte Carlos Sequential Methods) to handle earthquake data is presented. A methodology based on recursive algorithms is proposed that allows estimating and predict the magnitudes of seismic events from the time, location and magnitude of the event past. To approximate the solution of the stochastic differential equation, the Euler-Maruyama and Milstein structures were defined. New approaches for collective analysis of the data and an engineering model for the source are discussed with a few numerical results. © 2019","<b>A look inside banking profitability: Evidence from a dollarized emerging country<\/b><br><br>We empirically analyze the determinants of private banking profitability in Ecuador for the period 2002−2017. We contribute to the growing literature in four ways. First, we propose a more robust measure to quantify technical efficiency by using a two stages DEA with a Fractional Response Model. Second, we propose to jointly use three competition – market power measures, in line with the new industrial organization approach, to improve the analysis of industry determinants, which has always been done assessing separately every market power measure. Third, we introduce two new factors that may influence banking profitability: regulatory/institutional variables and dollarization derived factors, to test how being a dollarized (with foreign currency) economy may affect banks’ profitability. Finally, to address the weakness coming from the dynamic form of the Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM), we perform an improved version of it by treating the capital as an endogenous variable and several micro-determinants as given. We also perform some robustness checks by using a Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) in order to identify a robust set of determinants. Our results show that capital ratio, lending rate, labor productivity, size, efficiency and assets composition are micro-stable determinants of banks ‘profitability. In addition, we found that market power is a strong determinant of Ecuadorians’ banks profitability. Regarding macroeconomic factors, we found that the GDP cycle, inflation and spread are determinants of banking profitability while the regulatory variables did not show any relation. Finally, our results show that dollarization derived factors have an effect on private banking profitability. © 2019 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","<b>A Realist Approach to Policy Design<\/b><br><br>This chapter presents the realist approach that provided our analytical framework. It defines the causal mechanism of a policy outcome from a realist methodology, then it displays a method of cross-case comparison for policy design, including the case selection, and it unpacks the causal mechanism linking resource nationalism to a deficit of public accountability. Section 2 is dedicated to unpack the causal mechanism of a policy outcome in policy design. It starts with defining causality as necessity and causal mechanisms as causal forces, then it proceeds with optimizing case selection for small-n comparison. Section 3 explains how to conduct a cross-case comparison of this causal mechanism. It starts presenting the basics of set-theoretic research design, then it explains how the Bayesian logic of likelihood can be utilized to assess empirical evidence, and it proposes a template for comparative policy design. © 2020, The Author(s).","<b>Probabilistic safety assessment of concrete columns by approximate bayesian computation<\/b><br><br>Engineering practice commonly requires the calibration of complex numerical models based on experimental data, which is typically carried-out as a trial and error process whose success is highly influenced by human errors. The Bayesian procedure is a robust methodology to solve this problem which also allows quantification of the uncertainties. However, this procedure requires the knowledge of a likelihood function, which sometimes is difficult to evaluate or directly impossible to obtain. For such cases, the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method is an efficient alternative to address the calibration of a complex numerical probabilistic model based on data. This paper presents the applicability of the ABC method using an efficient algorithm called ABC-SubSim for the calibration of a complex non-lineal mechanical model. A set of uncertain model parameters from a reinforced concrete column subjected to lateral cyclic loads, are indirectly inferred with quantified uncertainty with a low computational cost. These parameters are difficult to observe experimentally and are crucial to asses the structural vulnerability and safety under seismic loads. Results show that the proposed methodology reduces the uncertainty about the mechanical parameters and makes them learn from the data, hence making this algorithm useful for uncertainty management and safety assessment. Influence of axial load on reinforced concrete beam-column models is also discussed. Finally, the paper discusses further improvements required for the ABC-SubSim based on sensitivity analysis and numerical trials carried-out over the course of this research.

Realist process tracing is philosophically grounded in scientific realism, according to which causal explanations of the world are possible beyond non-observable but detectable forces. It focuses on the causal mechanism that explains how an event X triggers a process leading to an outcome Y. It aims at opening the black box of causation through deep within-case studies and small-N comparison. The template for using realist process tracing in comparative policy analysis includes: (1) the theorization and operationalization of a causal mechanism, (2) the selection of a typical case on the causal mechanism for theory-building or testing, (3) the design of empirical tests based on the expected observations for each part of the mechanism, (4) evidence gathering and assessment through Bayesian analysis, and (5) cross-case comparison with another typical or a deviant case for confirming or disconfirming evidence. The chapter concludes with a reflection on how realist process tracing serves policy learning by improving transparency and replicability. © B. Guy Peters and Guillaume Fontaine 2020.

Such a fact has naturally led the emergence of small and medium sized companies devoted to the production of quality roses in the Ecuadorian highlands, which intrinsically entails resource usage optimization. One of the first steps towards optimizing the use of resources is to forecast demand, since it enables a fair perspective of the future, in such a manner that the in-advance raw materials supply can be previewed against eventualities, resources usage can be properly planned, as well as the misuse can be avoided. Within this approach, the problem of forecasting the supply of roses was solved into two phases: the first phase consists of the macro-forecast of the total amount to be exported by the Ecuadorian flower sector by the year 2020, using multi-layer neural networks. In the second phase, the monthly demand for the main rose varieties offered by the study company was micro-forecasted by testing seven models. In addition, a Bayesian network model is designed, which takes into consideration macroeconomic aspects, the level of employability in Ecuador and weather-related aspects. This Bayesian network provided satisfactory results without the need for a large amount of historical data and at a low-computational cost. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>A Comparison of Machine Learning and Classical Demand Forecasting Methods: A Case Study of Ecuadorian Textile Industry<\/b><br><br>This document presents a comparison of demand forecasting methods, with the aim of improving demand forecasting and with it, the production planning system of Ecuadorian textile industry.

The impact on demand for textile products has been observed in variables such as sales prices and manufacturing costs, manufacturing gross domestic product and the unemployment rate. Being indicators that determine to a great extent, the quality and accuracy of the forecast, generating also, uncertainty scenarios. For this reason, the aim of this work is focused on the demand forecasting for textile products by comparing a set of classic methods such as ARIMA, STL Decomposition, Holt-Winters and machine learning, Artificial Neural Networks, Bayesian Networks, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, taking into consideration all the above mentioned, as an essential input for the production planning and sales of the textile industries. And as a support, when developing strategies for demand management and medium-term decision making of this sector under study. Finally, the effectiveness of the methods is demonstrated by comparing them with different indicators that evaluate the forecast error, with the Multi-layer Neural Networks having the best results with the least error and the best performance. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>Modeling of the spatial distribution of the vector Aedes Aegypti, transmitter of the Zika Virus in continental Ecuador by the application of GIS tools<\/b><br><br>In recent years Ecuador has suffered from the Zika virus. Geo-software and statistical software allowed the probabilistic identification of suitable ecological niche species, such as the vector Aedes aegypti, which is the leading cause of the Zika virus transmission, depending on the dependent and independent variables. These models require pre-weighted input, normalized, and rasterized inputs to continue the validation process to estimate their predictive performance through several statistics such as the confusion matrix or the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC). It resulted that the Maxent method has been with the higher predictive performance with a value of Area Under Curve (AUC) = 0.998, which describes the areas of Zika with a greater probability of the transmission vector resembling the actual distribution of the species as a function of the presence data and the predictor variables. A large part of the Ecuadorian coastal territory yielded a statistical-based, probabilistic presence of the vector, being the most vulnerable before a possible epidemiological risk. © 2020 Revista Bionatura.

A statistical post-processing is compulsory in order to improve the output from the physical model and to improve the weather forecast in the city. A neural network can be applied in order to carry out this task but it is necessary first to reduce its uncertainty. The Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) have been studied deeply thanks to its probability analysis, the uncertainty can be approximated. In this paper an analysis founded on the adjustment of the posterior predictive distribution based on estimators is carried out in order to reduce the prediction error variation (implicitly the uncertainty) in a Short-Term Weather Forecast for the Andean city of Quito. From the analysis it is obtained a maximum error forecast of 12% and it is proven that for Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) structures, the variation of the error reduces almost to the half with weight-decays of (formula presented) and (formula presented). © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>Estimating customer lifetime value: A metric alternative for customer segmentation applied to the retail sector<\/b><br><br>The success of a company depends on its ability to build and maintain long-term relationships with its most valuable buyers. Ecuadorian companies face the challenge of identifying, differentiating and segmenting their clients. In response to this need, this study seeks to identify an unconventional form of segmentation based on the expected monetary value of customer billing in the retail sector. To this end, a probabilistic model was implemented that is derived from the Pareto/NBD methodology with a Bayesian hierarchy approach to estimate the customer value (CLV), based on a RFM data structure that considers the recency, frequency and monetary value of customers. After the estimate, the respective segmentation of customers was made where 24% of them were found to generate 68% of sales, therefore, three-quarters of customers are considered unprofitable. This research proposes a more efficient segmentation alternative based on customer value in the context of a retail company. © 2020 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

In this area, the species that inhabit the intertidal zone have been subject to few studies. One of the species inhabiting these areas is the clingfish Gobiesox adustus (Gobiesocidae). Objective: To analyze for the first time the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) of G. adustus’ population from Isla del Coco and compare it with those of continental coast of Costa Rica and Ecuador. Methods: We constructed a haplotype network for these samples. Genetic diversity, distance and structure were calculated by several software. The historical demography of Isla del Coco samples was assessed with the method Bayesian skyline plot as implemented in BEAST2. Results: The samples segregate into three haplogroups: one consisting of the Isla del Coco samples, a second consisting of a subset of the Ecuador samples, and a third consisting of Costa Rica and the remaining Ecuador samples. The genetic distances between the three haplogroups range between 1.6% and 2.1% (uncorrected p-distance), and pairwise ΦST and AMOVA results between the three haplogroups show high and significant values. Conclusions: The Isla del Coco haplogroup showed a Pleistocene population growth, which agrees with demographic patterns found in other marine organisms. The history of isolation of the G. adustus population from Isla del Coco demonstrates the evolutionary independence of this population. © 2020, Universidad de Costa Rica.

The use of probabilistic graphic models in the field of education has been considered for this research. But the problem with these general learning procedures comes from the presence of a high number of variables that measure different aspects of the same concept. In this case, we have that all variables have some degree of dependence between them, without a true causal structure. Therefore, a new procedure is presented that makes a hierarchical grouping of the data while learning a joint probability distribution. We try to make a test for each case where the probability is measured in each model using propagation algorithms. Then, the probability logarithm is applied to each case and the results are added in each model to determine the best fit for the proposed one.

Proper ERP detection contributes to widening the scope of use and, in general, improving functionality. The morphology and latency of ERPs are variable among subject sessions, which complicates their detection. Although variability is an intrinsic feature of neuronal activity, it can be addressed with novel views on ERP detection techniques. In this paper, we propose an agile method for characterizing and thus detecting variable ERPs, which keeps track of their temporal and spatial information through the continuous measurement of the area under the curve in ERP components. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed ERP characterization for electrode selection in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and compare the results with other standard methods. We assess ERP classification for BCI use with Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) and cross-validation. We also evaluate performance with both the information transfer rate and BCI utility. The results of our validation tests show that this characterization helps to take advantage of the information on the evolution of positive and negative ERP components and, therefore, to efficiently select electrodes for optimized ERP detection. The proposed method improves the classification accuracy and bitrate of all sets of electrodes analyzed. Furthermore, the method is robust between different day sessions. Our work contributes to the efficient detection of ERPs, manages inter- and intrasubject variability, decreases the computational cost of classic detection methods and contributes to promoting low-cost personalized brain-computer interfaces. © 2013 IEEE.","<b>Benchmarking of Classification Algorithms for Psychological Diagnosis<\/b><br><br>Generating a clinical diagnosis of a mental disorder is a complex process due to the variety of biological factors that affect this type of condition, so it is necessary that a professional performs a deep evaluation in order to identify and determine the type of disorder that affects the patient.

The algorithms selected for comparison are: Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Bayesian Networks, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). The evaluation metrics used on the benchmarked were precision, accuracy, recall, error rate and also we analyzed the ROC curves and the AUC values. The general results show that the Logistic Regression algorithm obtained a better performance with 70.82% of accuracy.

Can we explain the biodiversity of Papillomaviruses based on this pattern? Objective: To analyse the phylogenetic diversity and phylogeography of most known genotypes and species belonging to Papillomaviridae Family isolated and molecularly characterized by distant latitudinal locations around the world. Methods: We collected 238 gene sequences encoding for the L1 and L2 viral capsid proteins from PaVE database. A geographical heat map based on the PV locations allowed to analyse the distribution and the number of PV species per country. Subsequently, a phylogenetic tree based on concatenated amino acid sequences L1 and L2 was constructed using a combination of Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods with Geneious version 11.2.1 and BEAST version 1.8.4. Statistical analysis with Principal Coordinate Analyses (PCA) using the Jaccard similarity index for presenceabsence were carried out to test the similarity of the groups in the phylogenetic tree based on their viral species, the host and origin country lists. Distance-based redundancy analysis generated an ordination plot of the similarity of viral species list per group of the phylogenetic tree vs. host species per group, the country list per group and the number of samples per group. Finally, the significance of each model was tested by Analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: A clear tendency of most of the papillomavirus (PV) species clustering in the Northern regions appeared. Our phylogenetic analyses largely support the taxonomic division into major papillomavirus genera (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Xi, Upsilon and Chi papillomaviruses), as reported in previous studies. Chelonid PV’s, a papillomavirus in turtles, appeared as the oldest group for all papillomaviruses. Minor inconsistencies were found within some of the major taxonomic groups explained by the exhausted phylogenetic analyses. Due to the different sampling data efforts with little replication in certain groups, hosts and countries, numerical models did not fit to the proposed hypothesis. Conclusions: Phylogeographical analysis allowed determining the global distribution of papillomaviruses species diversity per latitudinal location. As most of the papillomavirus (PV) species were clustered in the Northern regions, this may clearly represent a statistical bias because larger efforts in PV studies have historically been done in the US and Europe. The biogeographical trend of a latitudinal diversity gradient does not apply for papillomaviruses. Even though no support to the phylogeographical pattern of LDG for PV was obtained, our results may only be the product of a socio-economicalscientific artefact and not a natural phenomenon. © 2020, Universidad de Costa Rica.

Unfortunately, it usually happens that small but random quantities of the product get lost, stolen or broken without record as time passes, e.g., as a consequence of shoplifting. This is usual for retailers handling large varieties of inexpensive products, e.g., grocery stores. In turn, over time these discrepancies lead to stock freezing problems (see Ref. [1]), i.e., situations where the system believes the stock is above the re-order point but the actual stock is at zero, and so no replenishments or sales occur. Motivated by these issues, we model the interaction between sales, losses, replenishments and inventory levels as a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), where the inventory levels are unobserved (i.e., hidden) variables we wish to estimate. We present an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of the sale and loss distributions, which relies on solving a one-dimensional dynamic program for the E-step and on solving two separate one-dimensional nonlinear programs for the M-step. © 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

Assisting a subject during face recall by suggesting candidate faces can be challenging. One of the reasons is that the search space-the face space-is quite large and lacks structure. A commercial application of face recall is facial composite systems-such as Identikit, PhotoFIT, and CD-FIT-where a witness searches for an image of a face that resembles his memory of a particular offender. The inherent uncertainty and cost in the evaluation of the objective function, the large size and lack of structure of the search space, and the unavailability of the gradient concept makes this problem inappropriate for traditional optimization methods. In this paper we propose a novel evolutionary approach for searching the face space that can be used as a facial composite system. The approach is inspired by methods of Bayesian optimization and differs from other applications in the use of the skew-normal distribution as its acquisition function. This choice of acquisition function provides greater granularity, with regularized, conservative, and realistic results. © 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

In this paper is proposed two statistical models based on a system of stochastic differential equations (SDE) that model the dynamics of population growth, and three computational algorithms that allow the generation of probability distribution samples in high dimensions, in models that have non-linear structures and that are useful for making inferences. The algorithms allow to estimate simultaneously states solutions and parameters in SDE models. The interpretation of the parameters is important because they are related to the variables of growth, mortality, migration, physical-chemical conditions of the environment, among other factors. The algorithms are illustrated using real data from a sector of the population of the Republic of Ecuador, and are compared with the results obtained with the models used by theWorld Bank for the same data, which shows that stochastic models Proposals based on an SDE more adequately and reliably adjust the dynamics of demographic randomness, sampling errors and environmental randomness in comparison with the deterministic models used by the World Bank. It is observed that the population grows year by year and seems to have a definite tendency; that is, a clearly growing behavior is seen. To measure the relative success of the algorithms, the relative error was estimated, obtaining small percentage errors. © 2020 International Academic Press.","<b>Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Detect and Prevent Corruption in Procurement: A Systematic Literature Review<\/b><br><br>Transparency International estimates that the costs of corruption in public procurement reach between 20 and 25% of the contract value, sometimes reaching 40–50%.

The purpose is to obtain an early classifier that identifies Alzheimer’s disease, and thus contribute to improving the patient’s quality of life by applying appropriate therapies derived from early diagnosis. This work has the title of Second Round because it is the continuation of our previous results. Objective: To work with free conversations, to detect if polarity and tonality can be used to classify the phrases of those conversations and differentiate patients with Alzheimer’s. Methodology: Data from Charlotte and free interviews of patients with Alzheimer’s were used to calculate their correlation and thus determine the disconnection between the variables and the classification of Alzheimer’s patients. Results: 407 phrases from Charlotte and 432 phrases from Alzheimer’s were used in this study. A negative correlation showed the disconnection of the variables. It was more evident in Alzheimer’s than in Charlotte. The Bayes Net algorithm managed to classify Alzheimer’s with 84% F measure while J48 achieved 76% of this measure, with a Cross validation of 10 Folds, confirming our proposals described in previous works, for different conversations in this new study. Obtaining the mechanisms for the identification of Alzheimer’s disease is an object of analysis by many researchers. The point is to obtain an early classifier that identifies Alzheimer’s disease, to help improve the quality of life of patients and their families, by applying the appropriate therapies derived from early diagnosis. This work has the title of Second Round because it is the continuity of our previous results. However, these results cannot yet be defined as conclusive in their entirety, as they generate new questions and doubts exposed in the conclusions and future work sections. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","<b>Product quality reliability analysis based on rough Bayesian network<\/b><br><br>Simultaneous quality reliability analysis can detect the weak links in production process as early as possible, which can significantly improve product reliability. Aiming at the reliability in product quality, a model based on rough set and Bayesian network (RS-BN) is proposed in this paper. Simplify expert knowledge and reduce product quality factors using rough set theory, and the minimal product quality rules can be obtained. Then the Bayesian network is constructed and trained by the minimum rules. Based on the minimal rules, the complexity of Bayesian network structure and the difficulties of product reliability analysis are largely decreased. To verify the performance of the proposed RS-BN model, a competition dataset is utilized and four evaluation indicators are investigated, i.e., accuracy, F1-score, recall, and precision. Experimental results indicated that the proposed model is superior to the other three comparative models. © 2020 Totem Publisher, Inc.","<b>Climate Change Effects on the Development of Six Pristimantis Frog Species in Ecuador<\/b><br><br>Ecuador is regarded as being a mega-diverse country despite its limited land surface; it is home to around 602 amphibian species, of which 256 are endemic. However, Ecuador is also one of the countries that has a large number of endangered species, one of genus Pristimantis. Pristimantipopulation decline is attributed to synergy factors, such as pathogen outbreaks, habitat loss and climate change. The aim of this study is to generate potential distribution models for six Andean species belonging to the Pristimantis genus under different climate change scenarios. Potential distribution models were performed with bioclimatic variables together with each species records based on MaxEnt Entropy Models. The models’ quality was evaluated by AUC values, and the last step was the identification of highly responsive areas resulting in the most relevant to the preservation of the species included in this study. Categorization of MaxEnt research models are as follows: “Satisfactory” or “Excellent”. Predicted areas for the six species comply with suitable requirements for their subsistence. Potential future distribution shows the negative effects of climate change to include RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 environments, except for P. festae, which has a higher distribution area of 5.3% within RCP 4.5 and 6.3% at RCP 8.5. Protected areas partially contribute to species preservation, although 92% of P. cryophilius and 80% of P. festae specimens recorded were found within protected areas. © This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply 2020.","<b>A Bayesian Network Approach to Identity Climate Teleconnections Within Homogeneous Precipitation Regions in Ecuador<\/b><br><br>Reliable precipitation predictions require an understanding of climate teleconnections over precipitation. In Ecuador, these teleconnections were studied with correlation methods, but multivariate studies with several climatic indexes simultaneously has been less study. The objective of this work is to carry out a multivariate study using Bayesian networks to identify the influence of climate indexes in homogenous precipitation regions in Ecuador. The climate teleconnections, defined as the correlation between precipitation satellite data and climate indexes, as well as the regionalization of seasonality of precipitation were used to learn a Bayesian network in R software. It was characterized the structure and strength of the relationship between the teleconnections and the precipitation. Additionally, three types of belief propagation were used: regions to climate index, climate index to regions, and interactions between indexes. This was useful to determine whether the influence of a climate index is homogeneous throughout the country or varies by region, as well as to identify interactions between different indexes. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of precipitation in Ecuador, and to promote making evidence-based water resource decisions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","<b>Land consumption and income in Ecuador: A case of an inverted environmental Kuznets curve<\/b><br><br>The ratio of building permits to population is a key indicator to evaluate land consumption. However, few researchers focus on land consumption and its environmental spillovers, for developing countries. The aim of our study, using a Bayesian comparison approach applied to a spatial panel, is to analyse the existence of an inverted U-shaped curve relationship between land consumption and economic development, namely the environmental Kuznets curve, with data that ranges from 2007 to 2015 for 221 cantons in Ecuador. The Bayesian comparison approach allows us to identify: i) the spatial weight matrix that best fits the data, and ii) the best spatial model according to the type of spatial spillovers (local or global). These are both of extreme interest because a knowledge of the extent to which the spatial spillovers spread over space, and their functional form, supports the planning of effective land use policies. The results do not support the inverted U-shaped hypothesis of the Kuznets curve. By contrast, the curvature is convex, which means higher levels of land consumption for higher levels of wealth. Spatial spillovers spread to a limited extent, highlighting an imitation game among agents, both institutions and private agents, in the neighbour locations. Policy implications go from the strengthening of the institutional framework and local tax management, to the urban regeneration to limit real estate speculation. All these interventions should be coordinated among neighbours to avoid freeriding behaviours. © 2019 The Author(s)","<b>Development of Behavior Profile of Users with Visual Impairment<\/b><br><br>The interaction of the user with visual impairment with assistive technologies, and in particular with screen readers, generates a group of actions and events during their navigation. These interactions are defined as behavioral patterns, which have a sequence that occurs at specific time slot. Understanding user behavior by analyzing their interaction with applications, in addition, details the characteristics, relationships, structures and functions of the sequence of actions in a specific application domain. The objective of this document is to find activity patterns from a set of commands used by the user, combining data mining and a Bayesian model. This model calculates the probability of the functions used with the screen reader and generates a behavior profile to improve the user experience. For this study, the screen reader JAWS version 2018, the Open Journal Systems platform version 3.0.1 and a computer with Windows 10 operating system were used. During the first phase, command history used by the user by interacting with the Open Journal Systems platform were collected.

However, the source contributions may be uncertain and, apart from Bayesian approaches, to date there are only solid methods to estimate such uncertainties for two and three sources. We introduce an alternative uncertainty estimation method for four sources based on multiple tracers as input data. Taylor series approximation is used to solve the set of linear mass balance equations. We illustrate the method to compute individual uncertainties in the calculation of source contributions to a mixture, with an example from hydrology, using a 14-tracer set from water sources and streamflow from a tropical, high-elevation catchment. Moreover, this method has the potential to be generalized to any number of tracers across a range of disciplines. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

We propose a mathematical model, knowing the direct flows and destinations of passengers and the route matrix. We solve the system applying Bayesian inference, using the Monte Carlo technique which generates a large number of random samples that are accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis-Hasting criterion. The resulting value is the arithmetic mean value of all accepted samples. We validate the model through the analysis of the convergence of results, patterns of behavior of the origin-destination pairs and the sensitivity of the results to variations in the values of the links and destinations. Finally, we apply it to the South-East corridor network of Quito city, as particular case study. © 2019 IEEE.","<b>An ARX-petri nets algorithm for active identification of an AC/DC microgrid simulation<\/b><br><br>In this article, a new algorithm is developed for the identification of an AC/DC Microgrid (MG) using methods of 'Auto-Regressive with eXogenous inputs (ARX)' and Petri Nets (PN). An algorithm is shown in order to obtain a model of Distributed Generation (DG) systems for a MG. This algorithm aims to obtain a bank of models in which each model is obtained through the identification of a different point of operation. This method facilitates the identification of dynamic non-linear systems associated with MG systems.

In recent years, platforms based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for the monitoring of pollution in the air have been studied to deal with this problem, due to several advantages, such as low-costs, security, multitask and ease of deployment. However, due to the limitations in the flying time of the UAVs, these platforms could perform monitoring tasks poorly if the mission is not executed with an adequate strategy and algorithm. Their application can be improved if the UAVs have the ability to perform autonomous monitoring of the areas with a high concentration of the pollutant, or even to locate the pollutant source. This work proposes an algorithm to locate an air pollutant's source by using a UAV. The algorithm has two components: (i) a metaheuristic technique is used to trace the increasing gradient of the pollutant concentration, and (ii) a probabilistic component complements the method by concentrating the search in the most promising areas in the targeted environment. The metaheuristic technique has been selected from a simulation-based comparative analysis between some classical techniques. The probabilistic component uses the Bayesian methodology to build and update a probability map of the pollutant source location, with each new sensor information available, while the UAV navigates in the environment. The proposed solution was tested experimentally with a real quadrotor navigating in a virtual polluted environment. The results show the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm. © 2019 by the authors.","<b>Total generalized variation regularization in data assimilation for burgers’ equation<\/b><br><br>We propose a second–order total generalized variation (TGV) regularization for the reconstruction of the initial condition in variational data assimilation problems. After showing the equivalence between TGV-regularization and a Bayesian MAP estimator, we focus on the detailed study of the inviscid Burgers’ data assimilation problem. Due to the difficult structure of the governing hyperbolic conservation law, we consider a discretize–then–optimize approach and rigorously derive a first–order optimality condition for the problem. For the numerical solution, we propose a globalized reduced Newton–type method together with a polynomial line–search strategy, and prove convergence of the algorithm to stationary points. The paper finishes with some numerical experiments where, among others, the performance of TGV-regularization compared to TV-regularization is tested. © 2019 AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES.","<b>Characterization of the mitochondrial genome sequences of the liver fluke Amphimerus sp. (Trematoda: Opisthorchiidae) from Ecuador and phylogenetic implications<\/b><br><br>Amphimerus Barker, 1911 is a liver fluke infecting several animal species and humans. Being a digenetic trematode of the Opisthorchiidae family, Amphimerus is closely related to the genera Metorchis, Clonorchis and Opisthorchis. Recently, a high prevalence of Amphimerus infection in humans, cats, and dogs had been demonstrated in a tropical Pacific region of Ecuador. Hence, we determined and characterized the entire mt genome sequences of adult liver flukes, morphologically identified as Amphimerus, collected in the endemic region of Ecuador, and examined its phylogenetic relationships with flukes in the Opisthorchiidae family using Bayesian inference (BI) based on the concatenated amino acid sequences and partial cox1 sequences. The complete mt genome sequence (15, 151 bp in length) of the Amphimerus sp. contains 35 genes, including 12 protein-coding genes (PCGs, without atp8), two rRNAs (rrnL and rrnS) and 21 tRNAs, lacking trnG. The gene content and arrangement of the Ecuadorian Amphimerus mt genome was similar to those of other trematodes in the Opisthorchiidae family. All genes in the circular mt genome of Amphimerus sp. are transcribed from the same strand in one direction, with the A + T content of 60.77%. Genetic distances between Amphimerus sp. and other genera in Opisthorchiidae were rather high, ranging from 26.86% to 28.75% at nucleotide level and 29.37%–31.12% at amino acid level. Phylogenetic analysis placed the Ecuadorian Amphimerus within the branch of Opisthorchiidae, but very distinct from Opisthorchis. Our results indicate that the liver fluke Amphimerus from Ecuador does not belong to the genus Opisthorchis, and that it should be assigned under the genus Amphimerus. The determination of the mt genome of the Ecuadorian Amphimerus provides a new genetic resource for future studies on taxonomy and molecular epidemiology of Opisthorchiidae trematodes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Introgressive hybridisation between two widespread sharks in the east Pacific region<\/b><br><br>With just a handful of documented cases of hybridisation in cartilaginous fishes, shark hybridisation remains poorly investigated. Small amounts of admixture have been detected between Galapagos (Carcharhinus galapagensis) and dusky (Carcharhinus obscurus) sharks previously, generating a hypothesis of ongoing hybridisation. We sampled a large number of individuals from areas where the species co-occur (contact zones) across the Pacific Ocean and used both mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded SNPs to examine genetic admixture and introgression between the two species. Using empirical analytical approaches and simulations, we first developed a set of 1873 highly informative SNPs for these two species to evaluate the degree of admixture between them. Overall, results indicate a high discriminatory power of nuclear SNPs (F ST = 0.47, p < 0.05) between the two species, unlike mitochondrial DNA (Φ ST = 0.00 p > 0.05), which failed to differentiate these species. We identified four hybrid individuals (∼1%) and detected bi-directional introgression between C. galapagensis and C. obscurus in the Gulf of California along the east Pacific coast of the Americas. We emphasize the importance of including a combination of mtDNA and diagnostic nuclear markers to properly assess species identification, detect patterns of hybridisation, and better inform management and conservation of these sharks, especially given the morphological similarities within the genus Carcharhinus. © 2019","<b>Present and future incidence of dengue fever in Ecuador nationwide and coast region scale using species distribution modeling for climate variability's effect<\/b><br><br>Dengue fever, a vector-borne disease, represents a priority public health problem in Ecuador. Previous studies indicated that the ecology of the transmitter vector (Aedes aegypti) is influenced by environmental parameters and human behavior; however, the effects of those variables on mosquito population dynamics depend on local environmental features. In this study, we identified the most important factors influencing the risk of dengue virus infection in Ecuador. The maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) was used to determine the areas with a high probability of the presence of Aedes aegypti under current and future (2050) climatic conditions, using the location of reported dengue cases and potential environmental factors. The model performance was quantified based on an accuracy assessment. Additionally, we used meteorological data from the study period in a partial least square regression (PLS-R) to predict the number of total dengue cases (TDC) and then estimated the future number of cases using the equation obtained with the PLS-R. Population density, elevation, and mean temperatures of the warmest and wettest quarters were found to be the most important variables influencing the mosquito's geographical distribution. Maximum temperature and minimum temperature were the climatic factors with the best projecting capacity in predicting the TDC in the Ecuadorian coast region. The results show a greater mosquito presence probability in populated areas, with a considerable expansion of suitable habitat across the central and southern provinces by 2050. The temporal analysis revealed that the regional dengue outbreak season goes from March to June, and the future estimation predicted that the next large outbreak would occur in 2018. These results present a good intel for solutions of reduction of dengue cases in the country. This further will allow the responsible authorities to pinpoint proper vector control measurements by province. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Influence of Accelerometer Position on Gearbox Fault Severity Classification through Evaluation of Deep Learning Models<\/b><br><br>Gears are key elements in mechanical transmission systems. Fault diagnosis in gearboxes is a cutting-edge topic nowadays mainly addressed by machine learning approaches. The success classifying a fault under this approach depends directly on the quality of the information provided to the models, and in gearboxes, quality of captured information depends on the place where a sensor is located. In this work, we propose a deep learning approach for the evaluation of the best of two accelerometers positions for classifying nine severity levels in gearboxes. Based on the performance of LSTM models whose hyperparameters have been found by a Bayesian optimization, we show which one is the best source of information for this layout. Also, we have performed statistical comparisons in order to find any statistical differences between models and accelerometers. © 2019 IEEE.","<b>Assessing phylogenetic information to reveal uncertainty in historical data: An example using Goodeinae (Teleostei: Cyprinodontiformes: Goodeidae)<\/b><br><br>A major emerging challenge to resolution of a stable phylogenetic Tree of Life has been incongruent inference among studies. Given the increasing ubiquity of incongruent studies, analyzing the predicted phylogenetic utility and quantitative evidence regarding contributions toward resolution of commonly-used markers in historical studies over the last decade represents an important, yet neglected, component of phylogenetics. Here we examine the phylogenetic utility of two sets of commonly-used legacy markers for understanding the evolutionary relationships among goodeines, a group of viviparous freshwater fishes endemic to central Mexico. Our analyses reveal that the validity of existing inferences is compromised by both lack of information and substantially biased patterns of nucleotide substitution. Our analyses demonstrate that many of the evolutionary relationships of goodeines remain uncertain – despite over a century of work. Our results provide an updated baseline of critically needed areas of investigation for the group and underscore the importance of quantifying phylogenetic information content as a fundamental step towards eroding false confidence in results based on weak and biased evidence. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Genomics overrules mitochondrial DNA, siding with morphology on a controversial case of species delimitation<\/b><br><br>Species delimitation is a major quest in biology and is essential for adequate management of the organismal diversity. A challenging example comprises the fish species of red snappers in the Western Atlantic. Red snappers have been traditionally recognized as two separate species based on morphology: Lutjanus campechanus (northern red snapper) and L. purpureus (southern red snapper). Recent genetic studies using mitochondrial markers, however, failed to delineate these nominal species, leading to the current lumping of the northern and southern populations into a single species (L. campechanus). This decision carries broad implications for conservation and management as red snappers have been commercially over-exploited across the Western Atlantic and are currently listed as vulnerable. To address this conflict, we examine genome-wide data collected throughout the range of the two species. Population genomics, phylogenetic and coalescent analyses favour the existence of two independent evolutionary lineages, a result that confirms the morphology-based delimitation scenario in agreement with conventional taxonomy. Despite finding evidence of introgression in geographically neighbouring populations in northern South America, our genomic analyses strongly support isolation and differentiation of these species, suggesting that the northern and southern red snappers should be treated as distinct taxonomic entities. © 2019 The Author(s).","<b>Integration of renewable energies in conventional power systems based on computational reliability<\/b><br><br>We report the successful computational reliability of integrating renewable energy into conventional electric power systems. According to renewable resources available in the province of Imbabura in Ecuador, where there are sufficient renewable resources to generate clean energy with three types of technology, such as wind energy, photovoltaic solar energy and thermoelectric energy. We have been able to conduct two fundamental case studies, and then calculate reliability indices using the non-sequential Monte Carlo method using Matlab programming. The reliability indices allowed us to evaluate the reliability of the system. Due to the fact that the lower the reliability index, the higher the reliability of the system. As a result, this paper provides a promising method for increasing the reliability of electric power systems and supporting the future integration of renewable energies. © 2019, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

Yet, the determinants of spatial variation in trait matching remain largely unaddressed. Here, we generate a hypothesis that is based on the geographical distributions of species morphologies. To illustrate our hypothesis, as a study system we use hummingbirds in the tropical Andes. Hummingbirds with specialized morphologies (i.e., long or curved bills) may forage on flowers that are inaccessible to hummingbirds with generalized bill morphologies (i.e., small-to-medium-sized bills with no curvature), yet the vast majority of hummingbirds have generalized bill morphologies. Thus, we propose that trait matching across space is determined by the distribution of morphological specialists. In the Andes, we observe the richness of specialized hummingbird morphotypes to peak at high and low elevations. Therefore, we hypothesize that trait matching should be most influential in predicting pairwise interactions at high and low elevations. We illustrate our hypothesis by field observations along an elevational gradient in Podocarpus National Park (Ecuador). Using Bayesian hierarchical modeling of interaction frequencies in combination with network analyzes, we found that hummingbirds at high and low elevations contributed to resource partitioning by foraging on morphologically close-matching flowers. Moreover, at high and low elevations, hummingbirds with specialized morphologies showed a stronger tendency to visit close-matching flowers than morphological non-specialists did. In contrast, at mid-elevations, hummingbirds were not attracted to morphologically close-matching flowers. These results suggest that the spatial distribution of specialized morphotypes determines trait matching and the partitioning of interactions within hummingbird–plant communities.

Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences were used in Bayesian and Maximum likelihood analyses to generate a phylogenetic hypothesis for Apogon species. Bayesian inferences were used to date the cladogenetic events. Analyses with BioGeoBEARS were conducted to reconstruct the biogeographic history and ancestral ranges. The phylogenetic results show a monophyletic clade of TEP Apogon species with A. imberbis from the eastern Atlantic as sister species. The two lineages diverged during the Miocene. Within the TEP clade, two subclades diverged at around 11.1 million years ago (Mya): one clusters the coastal continental species (A. pacificus, A. retrosella and A. dovii), and the second clusters the oceanic island species (A. atradorsatus, A. atricaudus and A. guadalupensis). The estimated diversification times of these subclades were 9.8 and 7.1 Mya, respectively. Within each subclade, species divergences occurred during the Pliocene-Pleistocene epochs. The divergent event between the Atlantic A. imberbis and Apogon TEP clade corresponds to the first closure event of the Central American Seaway. The biogeographic history of Apogon within the TEP appears to be the result of vicariant, dispersal and founder events that occurred during the last 11 million years. The vicariant and dispersal events occurred along the mainland and were associated with the origin of the Central American Gap. The founder events could have allowed the invasion of Apogon to TEP island areas and could have been driven by ancient warming oceanic waters, changes in circulation of marine currents, and the presence of seamounts in ancient marine ridges that allowed the settlement of marine biota. These factors may have allowed Apogon lineages to cross the TEP biogeographic barriers at different times, with subsequent genetic isolation. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Integrative taxonomy unravels cryptic diversity in the Paratrichodorus hispanus-group complex and resolves two new species of the genus and the molecular phylogeny of the family (Nematoda: Trichodoridae)<\/b><br><br>The genus Paratrichodorus currently comprises 26 species of polyphagous ectoparasitic plant nematodes that are distributed worldwide and include a few tobravirus vector species. Paratrichodorus is one of the most difficult genera for species identification because it is phenotypically conserved, with morphometric characters that often overlap between species. From 2003 to 2016, nematode surveys were conducted in southern Spain, and the present study addresses 22 nematode populations of the Paratrichodorus hispanus group. Among them, two new species, Paratrichodorus almadenensis sp. nov. And Paratrichodorus ramblensis sp. nov., are described here morphologically and molecularly and compared with topotype specimens of Paratrichodorus hispanus. Furthermore, this analysis was complemented with the first molecular data for this species complex and for the genus Monotrichodorus. The phylogeny of family Trichodoridae showed the relationship of Monotrichodorus with Trichodorus, both of which are phylogenetically associated with the P. hispanus species group, including the two newly described species. Several phylogenetic hypotheses about the monophyly of the genera with molecular data composing the family Trichodoridae were tested using Shimodaira-Hasegawa and approximately unbiased tests.

The anticipated model will acquire importance for the evaluation with the different efforts for which it will be in the next stage of the drill string. The methodology is exposed through the reconstruction of states of the synthetic model states proposed by Johancsik, Friesen, and Dawson, using the Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), observing good adjustment of torsion and drag states estimated by the filters with respect to the real values. Filters performance was evaluated in terms of the mean square error, showing variability of the estimated errors 0.05 for EnKF and 0.01 for UKF and a fast execution of the algorithms 3.07 (seg) for EnKF and 0.48 (seg) for UKF. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","<b>GKFP: A new fuzzy clustering method applied to bearings diagnosis<\/b><br><br>This paper proposes a new clustering method called Gustafson-Kessel with Focal Point (GKFP).

Thus the method identifies clusters with uncorrelated or strongly correlated data while it allows the user to explore different regions of the feature space with different levels of detail. Due to the possibility of dealing with correlated data, a regularization procedure might be necessary. Therefore, the paper also briefly describes a Bayesian regularization which can be associated with GKFP.

Six candidate growth models with asymptotic and non-asymptotic characteristics were tested. The best model was determined by information theory, according to Bayesian (BIC) and Akaike (AICc) information criteria and the weight of evidence in favour of model i (Wi). For U. cordatus, P. izumiae and the females of A. cribrarius, the best growth model corresponded to case 1 of Schnute model. In male A. cribrarius, the highest Wi was observed for the case 1 of Schnute model according to both criteria, but seasonal models were also plausible to describe growth. In P. longirostris, discrepancies were observed between criteria. The BIC supported the case 1 of Schnute in females, but the AICc did not identify a winner model (Wi > 90%); the case 1 and case 4 of Schnute displayed the highest Wi. The males that exhibited the highest Wi values were Schnute case 4 > Schnute case 3 > von Bertalanffy > Gompertz > Logistic. This study highlights the importance of considering different assumptions in growth patterns of the species and does not impose any a priori mathematical framework to available data. Abbreviations: AIC: Akaike Information Criterion. BIC: Bayesian Information Criterion Impact Statement The multi-model approach improves the model selection based on information criteria to re-describe patterns of growth in some decapod crustaceans. The von Bertalanffy growth model is not appropriate to describe the growth pattern based on the available data.

The general objective of this study is to determine simultaneously: non-linearity, structural changes, asymmetries and outliers that are characteristics present in many financial series. The methodology is empirically illustrated using series that measure the annual growth rate of industrial production in the MERCOSUR countries. The sampling algorithm [1] is implemented to estimate the parameters of the model. The parameters were estimated in terms of expected values a posteriori and standard deviations a posteriori. Three criteria is used to assess the prediction model: square root of the mean quadratic error (RSME), the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test and the TRC statistical test. These measures of goodness-of-fit show, that the estimates have small errors. The execution time of the algorithm is calculated, observing high performance. As a result of the analysis of the data, it is concluded that there is no reduction of economic volatility and no reduction in the depth of economic cycles. At the breakpoints, atypical values and non-linearity in the data are observed. It also shows that there are no common economic cycles for the countries analyzed. © 2019 ASEPUMA.

The ontology provides the knowledge about the performance factors and their relationships in the communication networks, to configure the structure of the Bayesian network. The Bayesian network is the stochastic reasoning mechanism used by the decision-making system. We present several tests on the NS2 simulator, and we observe an improvement in the system performance, for scenarios with high reconfiguration requirements.

In the summer of 2015, unprecedented and massive mats of S. fluitans and S. natans have been observed throughout the Mexican Caribbean including exceptional accumulations ashore. This study uses stable isotopes to assess the impact of Sargassum blooms on the trophic dynamics of the Diadema antillarum sea urchin, a keystone herbivore on many Caribbean reefs. Bayesian models were used to estimate the variations in the relative proportions of carbon and nitrogen of assimilated algal resources. At three lagoon reef sites, the niche breadth of D. antillarum was analysed and compared under massive influx of drifting Sargassum spp. vs. no influx of Sargassum blooms. The effects of the leachates generated by the decomposition of Sargassum led to hypoxic conditions on these reefs and reduced the taxonomic diversity of macroalgal food sources available to D. antillarum. Our trophic data support the hypothesis that processes of assimilation of carbon and nitrogen were modified under Sargassum effect. Isotopic signatures of macroalgae associated with the reef sites exhibited significantly lower values of-15N altering the natural herbivory of D. antillarum. The Stable Isotopes Analysis in R (SIAR) indicated that, under the influence of Sargassum blooms, certain algal resources (Dictyota, Halimeda and Udotea) were more assimilated due to a reduction in available algal resources. Despite being an abundant available resource, pelagic Sargassum was a negligible contributor to sea urchin diet. The Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R (SIBER) analysis displayed differences between sites, and suggests a reduction in trophic niche breadth, particularly in a protected reef lagoon. Our findings reveal that Sargassum blooms caused changes in trophic characteristics of D. antillarum with a negative impact by hypoxic conditions. These dynamics, coupled with the increase in organic matter in an oligotrophic system could lead to reduce coral reef ecosystem function. © 2019 PeerJ Inc..

The aim of the present study was to estimate the true prevalence of brucellosis together with diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of three serological tests in humans of the northwestern part of Ecuador using a Bayesian approach adjusted for the dependencies among the multiple tests to avoid any misinterpretation. In addition, the causal agent responsible for human brucellosiswas also identified.Using a total of 3,733 samples collected from humans in this area between 2006 and 2008, the prevalence of human brucellosis and the diagnostic test characteristics of the Rose Bengal fast agglutination test (RBT), Wright's slow agglutination test with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt dehydrate (EDTA) (SAT-EDTA), and indirect ELISA (iELISA) were estimated using a Bayesian approach. The estimated true prevalence of human brucellosis was 1%(credibility interval: 0.4-1.6). The sensitivities of iELISA and RBT were higher than and similar (95.1%and 95.0%, respectively) to those of SAT-EDTA (60.8%). Even though all tests indicated a high specificity (> 99.0%), the specificity ofSAT-EDTAwas highest (99.9%).The circulatingstrain in this studyareawas identified to beBrucella abortus biotype 4 based on culture andmicrobiological characterization. The RBT and the iELISA are recommended for estimating the true prevalence of human brucellosis and/or for surveillance programs following their high sensitivities and specificities. The proposed strategy supports evidence-based medicine for clinicians and policy-makers to ensure appropriate preventive and control program of brucellosis worldwide. © 2019 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.","<b>The Need to Quantify Hazard Related to Non-magmatic Unrest: From BET_EF to BET_UNREST<\/b><br><br>Most volcanic hazard studies focus on magmatic eruptions and their accompanying phenomena. However, hazardous volcanic events can also occur during non-magmatic unrest, defined as a state of volcanic unrest in which no migration of magma is recognised. Examples include tectonic unrest, and hydrothermal unrest that may lead to phreatic eruptions. Recent events (e.g. Ontake eruption, September 2014) have demonstrated that the successful forecasting of phreatic eruptions is still very difficult. It is therefore of paramount importance to identify indicators that define the state of non-magmatic unrest. Often, this type of unrest is driven by fluids-on-the-move, requiring alternative monitoring setups, beyond the classical seismic-geodetic-geochemical architectures. Here we present a new version of the probabilistic model BET (Bayesian Event Tree), called BET_UNREST, specifically developed to include the forecasting of non-magmatic unrest and related hazards. The structure of BET_UNREST differs from the previous BET_EF (BET for Eruption Forecasting) by adding a dedicated branch to detail non-magmatic unrest outcomes. Probabilities are calculated at each node by merging prior models and past data with new incoming monitoring data, and the results can be updated any time new data has been collected. Monitoring data are weighted through pre-defined thresholds of anomaly, as in BET_EF. The BET_UNREST model is introduced here, together with its software implementation PyBetUnrest, with the aim of creating a user-friendly, open-access, and straightforward tool to support short-term volcanic forecasting (already available on the VHub platform). The BET_UNREST model and PyBetUnrest tool are tested through three case studies in the frame of the EU VUELCO project. © 2017, The Author(s).","<b>Balancing plant conservation and agricultural production in the ecuadorian dry Inter-Andean Valleys<\/b><br><br>Background: Conserving both biodiversity and ecosystem services is a major goal of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Hotspots for biodiversity in the Andes significantly overlap with areas with dense human populations that sustain their economy through agricultural production. Therefore, developing management forms that reconcile food provisioning services—such as agriculture—with biodiversity conservation must be addressed to avoid social conflicts and to improve conservation in areas where biodiversity co-occurs with other ecosystem services. Here, we present a high-resolution conservation plan for vascular plants and agriculture in the Ecuadorian Dry Inter-Andean Valleys (DIAV) hotspot. Trade-offs in conserving important areas for both biodiversity and agriculture were explored. Methods: We used a dataset containing 5,685 presence records for 95 plant species occurring in DIAVs, of which 14 species were endemic. We developed habitat suitability maps for the 95 species using Maxent. Prioritization analyses were carried out using a conservation planning framework. We developed three conservation scenarios that selected important areas for: biodiversity only, agriculture only, and for both biodiversity and agriculture combined. Results: Our conservation planning analyses, capture 33.5% of biodiversity and 11% of agriculture under a scenario solely focused on the conservation of biodiversity. On the other hand, the top 17% fraction of the agriculture only scenario captures 10% of biodiversity and 28% of agriculture. When biodiversity and agriculture were considered in combination, their representation varied according to the importance given to agriculture. The most balanced solution that gives a nearly equal representation of both biodiversity and agriculture, was obtained when agriculture was given a slightly higher importance over biodiversity during the selection process. Discussion: This is the first evaluation of trade-offs between important areas for biodiversity and agriculture in Ecuadorian DIAV. Our results showed that areas with high agricultural productivity and high biodiversity partly overlapped. Our study suggests that a land-sharing strategy would be appropriate for conserving plant diversity and agriculture in the DIAV. Overall, our study reinforces the idea that friendly practices in agriculture can contribute to biodiversity conservation. © 2019 Quintana et al.","<b>A bizarre new species of Lynchius (Amphibia, Anura, Strabomantidae) from the Andes of Ecuador and first report of Lynchius parkeri in Ecuador<\/b><br><br>We describe a new species of Lynchius from the eastern montane forest of southern Ecuador. We also report the occurrence of L. parkeri in Ecuador, on paramos of Yacuri National Park, near the border with Peru. We used morphological and genetic evidence for the description of the new species and the new report of L. parkeri. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference on DNA sequences for mitochondrial and nuclear genes. The phylogeny shows that L. simmonsi is sister to a clade composed of the remaining species of Lynchius and that the new species is sister to L. flavomaculatus. The new species has a prominent and heavily ossified head with noticeably spiculate cranial exostosis that easily distinguishes it from all its congeners. The dorsal region and limbs present several reduced subconical and rounded tubercles and pronounced dermal ridges on the dorsum. We also describe the osteology of the new species based on x-rays of the holotype. Only six species of Lynchius, two known to occur in Ecuador (L. flavomaculatus and L. simmonsi). The description of L. megacephalus sp. n. and new record of L. parkeri double the number of known Lynchius in Ecuador and suggest that the diversity of Ecuadorian and Peruvian Lynchius is still underestimated.

Despite the several therapeutic and economic advantages of this new paradigm, it is important to follow certain guidelines, in order to build a safe, useful, scalable, and ergonomic tool. This work proposes to address all these points, through the case study of a physical tele-rehabilitation platform for patients after hip replacement surgery. The scalability and versatility of the system is handled by the implementation of a modular architecture. The safeness and effectiveness of the tool is ensured by an artificial intelligence module that assesses the quality of the movements performed by the user. The usability of the application is evaluated by a cognitive walkthrough method. Results show that the system (i) is able to properly assess the correctness of the human’s motion through two possible methods (Dynamic Time Warping and Hidden Markov Model), and (ii) provides a good user experience. The discussion addresses (i) the advantages and disadvantages of the main approaches for a gesture recognition of therapeutic movements, and (ii) critical aspects to provide the patient with the best usability of a tele-rehabilitation platform. © 2019 by the authors.

Several causes can lead to this issue, the academic factor being a potential reason. The main objective of this research is to detect dropout patterns in the “Técnica del Norte” University (Ecuador), based on personal and academic historical data, using predictive classification techniques in data mining. The KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) process was used to determine desertion patterns focused on two approaches: (i) Bayesian, and (ii) Decision Trees, both implemented on Weka. The classifiers performance was quantitatively evaluated using the confusion matrix and quality metrics. The results proved that the technique based on decision trees had slightly better performance than the Bayesian approach on the processed data. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","<b>Social-ecological modelling of the spatial distribution of dengue fever and its temporal dynamics in Guayaquil, Ecuador for climate change adaption<\/b><br><br>Researchers have showed that climatic, population, economic, and social characteristics contribute to the proliferation of Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue fever (DF) in Ecuador. In this study, we identified the factors with the greatest influence on dengue virus spread using a spatio-temporal analysis. We applied the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) to determine the spatial distribution of DF and identify areas with high probability of presence of A. aegypti by analyzing monthly climatic conditions, locations of reported dengue cases during 2012, and social factors in Guayaquil. Social variables showed greater influence on the presence and spread of disease during dengue outbreak season. The best model performance was obtained when the most important social variables were grouped based on components of the population's unsatisfied basic needs (UBN). Head of the household was a woman, the household was unoccupied, and UBN related to housing conditions at the household level were the most significant social risk factors. The final spatial distribution shows that the districts with the highest risks of infection are located mainly in the southern portion of the city, therefore these areas must take priority when integrated vector-control interventions and prevention protocols are carried out. © 2018","<b>The evolutionary history of the goby Elacatinus puncticulatus in the tropical eastern pacific: Effects of habitat discontinuities and local environmental variability<\/b><br><br>Habitat discontinuities, temperature gradients, upwelling systems, and ocean currents, gyres and fronts, can affect distributions of species with narrow environmental tolerance or motility and influence the dispersal of pelagic larvae, with effects ranging from the isolation of adjacent populations to connections between them. The coast of the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) is a highly dynamic environment, with various large gyres and upwelling systems, alternating currents and large rocky-habitat discontinuities, which may greatly influence the genetic connectivity of populations in different parts of the coast. Elacatinus puncticulatus is a cryptic, shallow-living goby that is distributed along the continental shore of virtually the entire TEP, which makes it a good model for testing the influence of these environmental characteristics in the molecular evolution of widespread species in this region. A multilocus phylogeny was used to evaluate the influence of habitat gaps, and oceanographic processes in the evolutionary history of E. puncticulatus throughout its geographical range in the TEP. Two well-supported allopatric clades (one with two allopatric subclades) were recovered, the geographic distribution of which does not correspond to any previously proposed major biogeographic provinces. These populations show strong genetic structure and substantial genetic distances between clades and sub-clades (cytb 0.8–7.3%), with divergence times between them ranging from 0.53 to 4.88 Mya, and recent population expansions dated at 170–130 Kya. The ancestral area of all populations appears to be the Gulf of Panama, while several isolation events have formed the phylogeographic patterns evident in this species. Local and regional oceanographic processes as well as habitat discontinuities have shaped the distribution patterns of the genetic lineages along the continental TEP. Large genetic distances, high genetic differentiation, and the results of species-tree and phylogenetic analyses indicate that E. puncticulatus comprises a complex of three allopatric species with an unusual geographic arrangement. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","<b>A state-space combined-cycle power plant model and simulation with IAPWS IF-97 properties<\/b><br><br>This paper presents an extension of a state-space model for a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant in order to include water and steam properties stated by the International Association for Properties of Water and Steam Industrial Formulation 1997 (IAPWS IF-97). The CCGT thermal cycles were implemented using MATLAB XSTEAM IF-97 functions, which provide an accurate steam and water properties within the thermodynamic states model. This model can be used in academia and training environments to test and validate different types of control systems, or even serve as an input for state-estimation methods. Steady state results for this model have been obtained for a generic 20 MW CCGT power plant, as well as a 133 MW steam generation plant in Ecuador. The results reveal that the model provides accurate values for steam flow, temperatures, and power outputs; moreover, the calculated thermodynamic states correspond to actual measurements. © 2018 IEEE.","<b>Mouth gape determines the response of marine top predators to long-term fishery-induced changes in food web structure<\/b><br><br>Here, we analyse changes throughout time in the isotopic niche of the Franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei), the South American fur seal (Arctocephalus australis) and the South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) from the Río de la Plata estuary and adjacent Atlantic Ocean to test the hypothesis that fishing may modify the diet of small-gape predators by reducing the average size of prey. The overall evidence, from stable isotope and stomach contents analyses, reveals major changes in resource partitioning between the three predators considered, mainly because of an increased access of Franciscana dolphins to juvenile demersal fishes. These results are consistent with the changes in the length distribution of demersal fish species resulting from fishing and suggest that Franciscana dolphin has been the most benefited species of the three marine mammal species considered because of its intermediate mouth gape. In conclusion, the impact of fishing on marine mammals goes beyond the simple reduction in prey biomass and is highly dependent on the mouth gape of the species involved. © 2018, The Author(s).","<b>Species Distribution Modelling: Contrasting presence-only models with plot abundance data<\/b><br><br>Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in ecology and conservation. Presence-only SDMs such as MaxEnt frequently use natural history collections (NHCs) as occurrence data, given their huge numbers and accessibility. NHCs are often spatially biased which may generate inaccuracies in SDMs. Here, we test how the distribution of NHCs and MaxEnt predictions relates to a spatial abundance model, based on a large plot dataset for Amazonian tree species, using inverse distance weighting (IDW). We also propose a new pipeline to deal with inconsistencies in NHCs and to limit the area of occupancy of the species. We found a significant but weak positive relationship between the distribution of NHCs and IDW for 66% of the species. The relationship between SDMs and IDW was also significant but weakly positive for 95% of the species, and sensitivity for both analyses was high. Furthermore, the pipeline removed half of the NHCs records. Presence-only SDM applications should consider this limitation, especially for large biodiversity assessments projects, when they are automatically generated without subsequent checking. Our pipeline provides a conservative estimate of a species' area of occupancy, within an area slightly larger than its extent of occurrence, compatible to e.g. IUCN red list assessments. © 2018 The Author(s).","<b>Prediction of large whale distributions: A comparison of presence-absence and presence-only modeling techniques<\/b><br><br>Species distribution models that predict species occurrence or density by quantifying relationships with environmental variables are used for a variety of scientific investigations and management applications. For endangered species, such as large whales, models help to understand the ecological factors influencing variability in distributions and to assess potential risk from shipping, fishing, and other human activities. Systematic surveys record species presence and absence, as well as the associated search effort, but are very expensive. Presence-only data consisting only of sightings can increase sample size, but may be biased in both geographical and niche space. We built generalized additive models (GAMs) using presence-absence sightings data and maximum entropy models (Maxent) using the same presence-absence sightings data, and also using presence-only sightings data, for four large whale species in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean: humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), blue (Balaenoptera musculus), Bryde's (Balaenoptera edeni), and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus). Environmental variables were surface temperature, surface salinity, thermocline depth, stratification index, and seafloor depth. We compared predicted distributions from each of the two model types. Maxent and GAM model predictions based on systematic survey data are very similar, when Maxent absences are selected from the survey trackline data. However, we show that spatial bias in presence-only Maxent predictions can be caused by using pseudo-absences instead of observed absences and by the sampling biases of both opportunistic data and stratified systematic survey data with uneven coverage between strata. Predictions of uncommon large whale distributions from Maxent or other presence-only techniques may be useful for science or management, but only if spatial bias in the observations is addressed in the derivation and interpretation of model predictions. © 2018 Fiedler, Redfern, Forney, Palacios, Sheredy, Rasmussen, García-Godos, Santillán, Tetley, Félix and Ballance.","<b>Topography and neighborhood crowding can interact to shape species growth and distribution in a diverse Amazonian forest<\/b><br><br>Abiotic constraints and biotic interactions act simultaneously to shape communities. However, these community assembly mechanisms are often studied independently, which can limit understanding of how they interact to affect species dynamics and distributions. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian neighborhood modeling approach to quantify the simultaneous effects of topography and crowding by neighbors on the growth of 124,704 individual stems ≥1 cm DBH for 1,047 tropical tree species in a 25-ha mapped rainforest plot in Amazonian Ecuador. We build multi-level regression models to evaluate how four key functional traits (specific leaf area, maximum tree size, wood specific gravity and seed mass) mediate tree growth response to topography and neighborhood crowding. Tree growth is faster in valleys than on ridges and is reduced by neighborhood crowding. Topography and crowding interact to influence tree growth in ~10% of the species. Specific leaf area, maximum tree size and seed mass are associated with growth responses to topography, but not with responses to neighborhood crowding or with the interaction between topography and crowding. In sum, our study reveals that topography and neighborhood crowding each influence tree growth in tropical forests, but act largely independently in shaping species distributions. While traits were associated with species response to topography, their role in species response to neighborhood crowding was less clear, which suggests that trait effects on neighborhood dynamics may depend on the direction (negative/positive) and degree of symmetry of biotic interactions. Our study emphasizes the importance of simultaneously assessing the individual and interactive role of multiple mechanisms in shaping species dynamics in high diversity tropical systems. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America","<b>Evaluation of Self-Rehabilitation Movements by Hidden Markov Model<\/b><br><br>This study aims to propose a statistical model to automatically assess the correctness of rehabilitation movements performed by patients.

(Asteraceae) taxa and its taxonomic implications<\/b><br><br>Centaurea is one of the richest but less investigated genera of tribe Cardueae (Asteraceae). We reconstructed an updated phylogeny of Iberian species of Centaurea sects. Centaurea, Jacea, Lepteranthus and Phalolepis by sampling representatives from 48 taxa (~60% of the taxonomic variation). Phylogenetic trees and haplotypic networks were based on ITS and trnLF sequences, and Bayesian dating analysis on ITS data. We found two main lineages within this monophyletic group: (1) a W Mediterranean Centaurea and Phalolepis plus C. diffusa (CP) clade; and (2) an E Mediterranean–Eurosiberian Jacea and Lepteranthus (JL) clade. Our analyses provide new reconstructions for species of C. sects. Jacea and Lepteranthus that support new taxonomic circumscriptions. The inferred divergence times indicated succesive splits of the CP and JL lineages during the Miocene (e.g. CP/JL, Serravalian; Jacea/Lepteranthus, Tortonian; C. hyssopifolia, C. gr. janeri, C. gr. exarata, Messinian) and the Pliocene (C. linifolia/C. antennata). Interspecific hybridizations and polyploidizations likely took place during the Pleistocene (1.5–0.7 Ma) interglacials, when several hybrid lineages apparently originated (e.g. C. x decipiens). Allopatric speciation probably played an important role in the diversification of the Iberian Centaurea taxa, since the origins of several endemic species occurred during mid-late Pleistocene times (2.2–1.3 Ma) in several disjunct Iberian ranges. © 2018 Società Botanica Italiana.","<b>Analysis of the Impact of Stator Interturn Short-Circuit Faults on Induction Machines Driven by Direct Torque Control<\/b><br><br>This paper addresses the analysis of three-phase squirrel-cage induction machine (IM) with interturn short-circuit (ITSC) fault and its influence on direct torque control (DTC). The particularities of the DTC such as its behavior, its standard heuristic derivation, and its nature of been a nonlinear hysteresis-based predictive controller are exploited, thus allowing the improvement and development of alternative explanations to the phenomena. The understanding of DTC and the development of the current state-space model of the asymmetric IM, presented here for first time in the literature, enables the analytical treatment of the research topic and the discovery of several DTC reactions to the fault. The ITSC impact on DTC and its reaction leads to the following twofold characterizations: first, unobservable and visible effects, and second, compensation and tolerant reactions. For purposes of simulation, a plug-and-play configurable circuit-block for the asymmetric IM was developed based on Norton's equivalent circuit. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the assertiveness of the developed analyses and theoretical findings, which allows future research in online fault diagnostics and condition monitoring of inverter-fed IM with this type of fault. © 2018 IEEE.","<b>Species delimitation and biogeography of the gnatcatchers and gnatwrens (Aves: Polioptilidae)<\/b><br><br>The New World avian family Polioptilidae (gnatcatchers and gnatwrens) is distributed from Argentina to Canada and includes 15 species and more than 60 subspecies. No study to date has evaluated phylogenetic relationships within this family and the historical pattern of diversification within the group remains unknown. Moreover, species limits, particularly in widespread taxa that show geographic variation, remain unclear. In this study, we delimited species and estimated phylogenetic relationships using multilocus data for the entire family. We then used the inferred diversity along with alternative taxonomic classification schemes to evaluate how lumping and splitting of both taxa and geographical areas influenced biogeographic inference. Species-tree analyses grouped Polioptilidae into four main clades: Microbates, Ramphocaenus, a Polioptila guianensis complex, and the remaining members of Polioptila. Ramphocaenus melanurus was sister to the clade containing M. cinereiventris and M. collaris, which formed a clade sister to all species within Polioptila. Polioptila was composed of two clades, the first of which included the P. guianensis complex; the other contained all remaining species in the genus. Using multispecies coalescent modeling, we inferred a more than 3-fold increase in species diversity, of which 87% represent currently recognized species or subspecies. Much of this diversity corresponded to subspecies that occur in the Neotropics. We identified three polyphyletic species, and delimited 4–6 previously undescribed candidate taxa. Probabilistic modeling of geographic ranges on the species tree indicated that the family likely had an ancestral origin in South America, with all three genera independently colonizing North America. Support for this hypothesis, however, was sensitive to the taxonomic classification scheme used and the number of geographical areas allowed. Our study proposes the first phylogenetic hypothesis for Polioptilidae and provides genealogical support for the reclassification of species limits. Species limits and the resolution of geographical areas that taxa inhabit influence the inferred spatial diversification history. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Temporal mitogenomics of the Galapagos giant tortoise from Pinzón reveals potential biases in population genetic inference<\/b><br><br>Empirical population genetic studies generally rely on sampling subsets of the population(s) of interest and of the nuclear or organellar genome targeted, assuming each is representative of the whole. Violations of these assumptions may impact population-level parameter estimation and lead to spurious inferences. Here, we used targeted capture to sequence the full mitochondrial genome from 123 individuals of the Galapagos giant tortoise endemic to Pinzón Island (Chelonoidis duncanensis) sampled at 2 time points pre- and postbottleneck (circa 1906 and 2014) to explicitly assess differences in diversity estimates and demographic reconstructions based on subsets of the mitochondrial genome versus the full sequences and to evaluate potential biases associated with diversity estimates and demographic reconstructions from postbottlenecked samples alone. Haplotypic diversities were equal between the temporal samples based on the full mitochondrial genome, but single gene estimates suggested either decreases or increases in diversity depending upon the region. Demographic reconstructions based on the full sequence were more similar between the temporal samples than those based on the control region alone, or a subset of 3 regions, where the trends in population size changes shifted in magnitude and direction between the temporal samples. In all cases, the estimated coalescent point was more distant for the historical than contemporary sample. In summary, our results empirically demonstrate the influence of sampling bias when interpreting population genetic patterns and punctuate the need for careful consideration of potentially conflicting evolutionary signal across the mitochondrial genome. © The American Genetic Association 2018.

The sizes used to determine these estimates can nevertheless be biased by the selectivity of the data source and how well the data represent a population. The average growth of the brachyuran crab Ucides occidentalis (Ortmann, 1897) (Ocypodidae) had been previously estimated utilizing data derived from either commercial catch or scientific field data, consequently generating conflicting results. We determined the average growth of male U. occidentalis by analyzing commercial catch data alone and, subsequently, estimated average growth from a combination of the same commercial data with scientific data collected in situ in mangrove areas (i.e., combined data). Size frequency distributions were constructed using Kernel density estimators, characterizing the modes as Gaussian components. A multi-modal approach was used to select one of five growth models (asymptotic, non-asymptotic, and versatile) that most closely represented the average growth estimated from both cohorts of combined data, which had previously been identified through modal progression, and commercial data. The case 1 of the Schnute model was selected as the best model by Akaike Information and Bayesian Information criteria for both commercial and combined data sets. A convex growth curve was generated for the commercial data (asymptotic growth), whereas an inverted vertical sigmoidal curve was generated for the combined data (non-asymptotic growth). The data sets differed in that commercial data were represented by adult individuals, whereas the combined data included juveniles and adults. This difference significantly affected the average growth estimates calculated for each data set. The growth pattern of male U. occidentalis is best described by a non-asymptotic growth curve, which is consistent with that reported for females of this species. © The Author(s) 2017.

However, there are still some countries in the region, including Ecuador, for which CSFV molecular information is lacking. To better understand the epidemiology of CSFV in the Americas, sequences from CSFVs from Ecuador were generated and a phylodynamic analysis of the virus was performed. Sequences for the full-length glycoprotein E2 gene of twenty field isolates were obtained and, along with sequences from strains previously described in the Americas and from the most representative strains worldwide, were used to analyse the phylodynamics of the virus. Bayesian methods were used to test several molecular clock and demographic models. A calibrated ultrametric tree and a Bayesian skyline were constructed, and codons associated with positive selection involving immune scape were detected. The best model according to Bayes factors was the strict molecular clock and Bayesian skyline model, which shows that CSFV has an evolution rate of 3.2 × 10−4 substitutions per site per year. The model estimates the origin of CSFV in the mid-1500s. There is a strong spatial structure for CSFV in the Americas, indicating that the virus is moving mainly through neighbouring countries. The genetic diversity of CSFV has increased constantly since its appearance, with a slight decrease in mid-twentieth century, which coincides, with eradication campaigns in North America. Even though there is no evidence of strong directional evolution of the E2 gene in CSFV, codons 713, 761, 762 and 975 appear to be selected positively and could be related to virulence or pathogenesis. These results reveal how CSFV has spread and evolved since it first appeared in the Americas and provide important information for attaining the goal of eradication of this virus in Latin America. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","<b>Magnolia mercedesiarum (Subsect. talauma, magnoliaceae): A new andean species from northern ecuador, with insights into its potential distribution<\/b><br><br>Magnolia mercedesiarum, a new species from the eastern slopes of the Andes in northern Ecuador, is described and illustrated, and a key to Ecuadorian Magnolia (subsect.

A comparative analysis of the data shows that the models are as reliable as the physiotherapists to discriminate and identify the motion errors. The results are discussed in terms of the required setup for a successful application in the field and further implementations to improve the accuracy and usability of the system. © 2018 by the authors.

Poeciliopsis infans is the only poeciliid species that was able to colonize the temperate highlands of central Mexico. We inferred the phylogenetic relationships, biogeographic history, and historical demography in the widespread Neotropical species P. infans and correlated this with geological events and the Quaternary glacial-interglacial climate in the highlands of central Mexico, using the mitochondrial genes Cytochrome b and Cytochrome oxidase I and two nuclear loci, Rhodopsin and ribosomal protein S7. Results: Populations of P. infans were recovered in two well-differentiated clades. The maximum genetic distances between the two clades were 3.3% for cytb, and 1.9% for coxI. The divergence of the two clades occurred ca. 2.83 Myr. Ancestral area reconstruction revealed a complex biogeographical history for P. infans. The Bayesian Skyline Plot showed a demographic decline, although more visible for clade A, and more recently showed a population expansion in the last 0.025 Myr. Finally, the habitat suitability modelling showed that during the LIG, clade B had more areas with high probabilities of presence in comparison to clade A, whereas for the LGM, clade A showed more areas with high probabilities of presence in comparisons to clade B. Conclusions: Poeciliopsis infans has had a complex evolutionary and biogeographic history, which, as in other co-distributed freshwater fishes, seems to be linked to the volcanic and tectonic activities during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. Populations of P. infans distributed in lowlands showed a higher level of genetic diversity than populations distributed in highlands, which could be linked to more stable and higher temperatures in lowland areas. The fluctuations in population size through time are in agreement with the continuous fluctuations of the climate of central Mexico. © 2018 The Author(s).","<b>Evaluating the impact of an Active Labour Market Policy on employment: Short- and long-term perspectives<\/b><br><br>The Labour Market Insertion Contract was an Active Labour Market Policy introduced in Spain. It was aimed at individuals who had difficulties entering the labour market, and it was introduced with the purpose of reducing the rate of unemployment. This article provides an estimation of the average impact that this contract had on the employability of individuals in the short and long term. A microeconomic analysis was carried out based on causal statistical inference by using propensity score matching and kernel and radial estimators. Data was taken from the most comprehensive database available, which is the Continuous Sample ofWork Histories. Results are consistent with literature reports and show that the employability of participants was inferior to that of individuals with similar, temporary-type contracts. This research contributes to the literature by evaluating whether there was empirical evidence to support the political decision to revoke or replace this kind of direct employment programme. © 2018 by the authors.","<b>Two new Andean species of Anolis lizard (Iguanidae: Dactyloinae) from southern Ecuador<\/b><br><br>We describe two new species of Anolis lizard that are sympatric on the Amazonian slopes of the Andes of southern Ecuador at elevations between 1440 and 1970 m.

This study focuses on estimating the probability of a person in Ecuador (at potential risk) contracting an infection due to ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli through the consumption of contaminated water, for which a residence area of people was considered in urban or rural areas. The analysis was carried out using the Bayes Theorem and the results show that in the rural population the probability of contracting an infection of this kind is 8.41% whilst in the urban area the probability is 3.57%.

To achieve this, many investigations look to improve BCI precision by increasing the number of electrodes with standard configurations, ignoring inter- A nd intra-subject variability. To control this variability in event-related potential (ERP)-based BCIs we propose to investigate the cumulative peak difference, an intrinsic characteristic of ERP, as a measure for electrode selection. The results shown in this work indicate that the proposed method improved accuracy and bitrate in all analyzed electrode sets.

We analyzed sequences of mitochondrial and nuclear genes, geographic distributions, as well as photographs of specimens deposited at museum collections. Phylogenetic analyses identified three major lineages formed by populations from: Venezuela and Colombia (M. c. regulus), Ecuador and northern Peru (M. elata, M. castaneiceps, M. orientalis, M. c. chapmani), and central Peru and Bolivia (M. c. coronata). We found further population structure within M. c. regulus and M. c. coronata, and population structure and complexity of plumage variation within the Ecuador-northern Peru lineage. Time-calibrated trees estimated that most intraspecific variation originated during the Pleistocene; however, this pattern may not be attributed to an increase in diversification rate during that period. We discuss these results in the context of the importance of geographic-ecological barriers in promoting lineage diversification along the Andes and put forward a preliminary taxonomic proposal for major lineages identified in this study. © 2018 Prieto-Torres et al.

To do so, the present study proposes a cognitive algorithm based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach to assess in real-time the quality of a human movement recorded through a low-cost motion capture device. The assessment of the correctness of the exercises, which includes the detection of multiple undesirable compensatory movements, shows a very high accuracy (the average performance = 97%). In addition, the proposed model shows a potential for providing the patients with real-time feedback on their performance (up to five times a second). A certain limitation of the model occurs for the compensatory movements characterized by an absence of translational motion of the centre of mass (17% of misclassifications). In this situation, additional features are required to properly assess the quality of the therapeutic exercise. © 2018 [International Journal of Artificial Intelligence].","<b>Volcanic Eruption Forecasts From Accelerating Rates of Drumbeat Long-Period Earthquakes<\/b><br><br>Accelerating rates of quasiperiodic “drumbeat” long-period earthquakes (LPs) are commonly reported before eruptions at andesite and dacite volcanoes, and promise insights into the nature of fundamental preeruptive processes and improved eruption forecasts. Here we apply a new Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo gamma point process methodology to investigate an exceptionally well-developed sequence of drumbeat LPs preceding a recent large vulcanian explosion at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador. For more than 24 hr, LP rates increased according to the inverse power law trend predicted by material failure theory, and with a retrospectively forecast failure time that agrees with the eruption onset within error. LPs resulted from repeated activation of a single characteristic source driven by accelerating loading, rather than a distributed failure process, showing that similar precursory trends can emerge from quite different underlying physics. Nevertheless, such sequences have clear potential for improving forecasts of eruptions at Tungurahua and analogous volcanoes. ©2018. American Geophysical Union.

The images were obtained under perspective projection with a camera installed on board at the front part of a tractor. Different approaches have addressed the problem based on crop row determination and then assuming that inter-row plants are weeds. Nevertheless, an important challenge is the identification of weeds intermixed within the crop rows. This issue is addressed on this paper by applying a minimum criterion distance based on the Mahalanobis distance derived from a Bayesian classification approach, this makes the main contribution. The identification of both intra- and inter-row weeds is useful for more accurate weed quantification for site-specific treatments. Image quality is affected by uncontrolled lighting conditions in outdoor agricultural environments. Also, different plant densities appear due to different growth stages affecting the crop/weed identification process. The proposed method was designed to deal with the above undesired situations, consisting of three phases: (i) segmentation, (ii) training and (iii) testing. The three phases are executed on-line for each image, where training is specific of each single image, requiring no prior training, as it is usual in common machine learning-based approaches, mainly supervised. This makes the second research contribution. The performance of the proposed approach was quantitatively compared against three existing strategies, achieving an accuracy of 91.8%, pixel-wise determined against ground-truth images manually built, with processing times ≤280 ms, which can be useful for real-time applications. © 2017 IAgrE","<b>Telerehabilitation platform for hip surgery recovery<\/b><br><br>The enhancement of ubiquitous and pervasive computing brings new perspectives in terms of medical rehabilitations.

To obtain the final product, the development process has been distributed in several stages. Objective To create a probabilistic model to evaluate and diagnose students based on a set of characteristics, which must be learned automatically through a generalization of the AutoClass model allowing the existence of hidden variables, each of them affecting a set different from observable variables (students’ answers to questions raised by an automatic learning system). Materials and methods. Our study will be carried out to define another form of structural learning based on the search of structures through evolutionary metaheuristic models. Results This model will allow the authorities of the UTEQ to identify inconveniences and setbacks in the teaching-learning process.

Due to its rarity, aspects about its natural history, ecology and distribution patterns are not well known, therefore, research is needed to generate knowledge about this carnivore and a first step is studying suitable habitat areas. We performed Ecological Niche Models and applied future climate change scenarios (2.6 and 8.5 RCP) to determine the potential distribution of this mammal in Colombia and Ecuador, with current and future climate change conditions; furthermore, we analysed its distribution along several land covers. We found that N. olivacea is likely to be found in areas where no records have been reported previously; likewise, climate change conditions would increase suitable distribution areas. Concerning land cover, 73.4% of N. olivacea potential distribution was located outside Protected Areas (PA), 46.1% in Forests and 40.3% in Agricultural Lands. These findings highlight the need to further research understudied species, furthering our understanding about distribution trends and responses to changing climatic conditions, as well as informig future PA designing. These are essential tools for supporting wildlife conservation plans, being applicable for rare species whose biology and ecology remain unknown. © Medrano-Vizcaino P, Gutierrez-Salazar P.","<b>Genetic structuring in a Neotropical palm analyzed through an Andean orogenesis-scenario<\/b><br><br>Andean orogenesis has driven the development of very high plant diversity in theNeotropics through its impact on landscape evolution and climate. The analysis ofthe intraspecific patterns of genetic structure in plants would permit inferring theeffects of Andean uplift on the evolution and diversification of Neotropical flora. Inthis study, using microsatellite markers and Bayesian clustering analyses, we reportthe presence of four genetic clusters for the palm Oenocarpus bataua var. batauawhich are located within four biogeographic regions in northwestern South America:(a) Chocó rain forest, (b) Amotape-Huancabamba Zone, (c) northwestern Amazonianrain forest, and (d) southwestern Amazonian rain forest. We hypothesize that theseclusters developed following three genetic diversification events mainly promoted byAndean orogenic events. Additionally, the distinct current climate dynamics amongnorthwestern and southwestern Amazonia may maintain the genetic diversificationdetected in the western Amazon basin. Genetic exchange was identified betweenthe clusters, including across the Andes region, discarding the possibility of any cluster to diversify as a distinct intraspecific variety. We identified a hot spot of geneticdiversity in the northern Peruvian Amazon around the locality of Iquitos. We alsodetected a decrease in diversity with distance from this area in westward and southward direction within the Amazon basin and the eastern Andean foothills. Additionally,we confirmed the existence and divergence of O. bataua var. bataua from var. oligocarpus in northern South America, possibly expanding the distributional range of thelatter variety beyond eastern Venezuela, to the central and eastern Andean cordilleras of Colombia. Based on our results, we suggest that Andean orogenesis is themain driver of genetic structuring and diversification in O. bataua within northwestern South America. © 2018 The Authors.","<b>On the use of natural user interfaces in physical rehabilitation: A web-based application for patients with hip prosthesis<\/b><br><br>This study aims to develop a telemedicine platform for self-motor rehabilitation and remote monitoring by health professionals, in order to enhance recovery in patients after hip replacement. The implementation of such a technology is justified by medical (improvement of the recovery process by the possibility to perform rehabilitation exercises more frequently), economic (reduction of the number of medical appointments and the time patients spend at the hospital), mobility (diminution of the transportation to and from the hospital) and ethics (healthcare democratization and increased empowerment of the patient) purposes. The Kinect camera is used as a Natural User Interface to capture the physical exercises performed at home by the patients. The quality of the movement is evaluated in real-time by an assessment module implemented according to a Hidden-Markov Model approach. The results show a high accuracy in the evaluation of the movements (92% of correct classification). Finally, the usability of the platform is tested through the System Usability Scale (SUS). The overall SUS score is 81 out of 100, which suggests a good usability of the Web application. Further work will focus on the development of additional functionalities and an evaluation of the impact of the platform on the recovery process. © 2018, Universidade Catolica Portuguesa.

To achieve this objective, new paradigms are necessary. The present work proposes an autonomic communication system, which uses a system of decision-making based on a Bayesian network, and a knowledge base based on an ontology, to take decisions of reconfiguration in the system. The main goal of the autonomic communication system is to adapt the communications platform to the characteristics of the context, in order to improve its performance. The ontology provides the knowledge about the performance factors and their relationships in the communication networks, to configure the structure of the Bayesian network. The Bayesian network is the stochastic reasoning mechanism used by the decision-making system. We present several tests on the NS2 simulator. In the tests carried out, we observe an improvement between 85% and 96% in the system performance, for scenarios where our approach of autonomic decision reconfigures the communication system. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

The adoption of policy aims triggers an institutional drift at three levels. At a normative level, bureaucratic centralism is adopted by the government. At the strategic level a sectorial policy fostering the statés control over the policy area is formulated. At an operational level, the government favors coercive conflict management to cope with protests against the extractive policy. The theoretical causal mechanism is confirmed after passing 19/20 empirical tests, which raises the posterior confidence up to 0.73 according to the Bayesian formalization. The findings show a way for institutional and policy change to tackle the resource curse, even though further research on other typical cases (such as Venezuela) and deviant cases (such as Mexico) should increase the external validity of the theory. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","<b>Combining reservoir computing and variational inference for efficient one-class learning on dynamical systems<\/b><br><br>Usually, time series acquired from some measurement in a dynamical system are the main source of information about its internal structure and complex behavior.

The main goals of this study were to investigate the phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic delimitation of the genera of the Milla complex and particularly of M. biflora. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference analyses were conducted using plastid and nuclear DNA sequence data and 60 morphological traits. We constructed independent data matrices that included 19 of the 20 species of the Milla complex and five outgroup species from the Brodiaea complex. Evolution of floral traits was also investigated. The phylogenetic trees showed incongruence among data matrices, but the total-evidence analysis supported the monophyly of Bessera and Petronymphe. Milla and Dandya were paraphyletic as traditionally circumscribed. The results suggest that genera of the Milla complex have evolved to show long floral tubes covering the ovary and erect flowers. The Milla s.s. clade included three main groups allied to (1) M. bryanii, (2) M. biflora and (3) M. oaxacana. Thus, our study supports the recognition of Bessera, Jaimehintonia, Petronymphe and Milla s.s. in the Milla complex that are defined by several synapomorphic characters, including connate filaments and T-shaped leaf vascular bundle for Bessera and four floral characters for Milla s.s.

In all size classes, fishes were the predominant prey group in the diet (Alimentary Index, %AI = 96.86) followed by cephalopods (%AI = 3.29) and crustaceans (%AI = 0.03). PERMANOVA analysis revealed significant variations in diet with body size: i) Class I YFT (≤50 cm in fork length, FL) fed mainly on laternfishes, family Myctophidae (%AI = 37.34), and jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas (%AI = 36.06), Class II YFT (50–60 cm, FL) consumed bullet and frigate tunas, Auxis spp., unidentifiable fish and jumbo squid (%AI = 47.75, %AI = 25.06 and%AI = 21.67, respectively), and Class III YFT (≥ 60 cm, FL) preyed almost exclusively on bullet and frigate tunas (%AI = 90.85). Mean ± SD muscle isotope values were 12.14 ± 1.95‰ for δ15N and −17.42 ± 0.27 for δ13C‰; mean (±SD) liver values were 11.30‰ for δ15N and −17.42 ± 0.27‰ for δ13C. Overall, liver and muscle samples showed significant size-related differences in δ15N and δ13C. Stable isotope Bayesian ellipses, SEAc, did not show trophic overlap among size classes. A significant positive linear correlation was observed between δ15N and δ13C measured in liver and muscle tissues with body size, suggesting an increase of prey size as tuna grew.

This approach captures a number of possible inflationary models, including those with non-canonical kinetic terms or scale-dependent non-gaussianities. We perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses using the latest cosmological publicly available measurements, which include Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from the Planck satellite. Within this parameterization, we discard scale invariance with a significance of about 10σ, and the running of the spectral index is constrained as αs=−0.60−0.10 +0.08×10−3 (68% CL errors). The limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio is r<0.005 at 95% CL from CMB data alone. We find no significant evidence for this alternative parameterization with present cosmological observations. The maximum amplitude of the equilateral non-gaussianity that we obtain, |fNL equil|<1, is much smaller than the current Planck mission errors, strengthening the case for future high-redshift, all-sky surveys, which could reach the required accuracy on equilateral non-gaussianities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","<b>A Bayesian approach to consequent parameter estimation in probabilistic fuzzy systems and its application to bearing fault classification<\/b><br><br>A bearing is an essential component in rotating machinery, one of its principal cause of failure, and its health condition is directly related to the safety and effective operation of such machinery. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that a probabilistic fuzzy system is applied to bearing fault classification. The type of probabilistic fuzzy classifier considered is a parsimonious fuzzy rule based model where each rule can diagnose a set of faults each one with its probability. For this kind of real world application, it is desirable to develop interpretable and accurate MIMO fuzzy systems, able to deal with the dimensionality and uncertainty present in data (vibration signals). For parameter estimation we adopt a two steps sequential state-of-the-art data-driven method. First, the antecedents of the rules are estimated using an iterative supervised clustering algorithm. Based on the antecedents the consequent parameters are then estimated. For this, a new method for consequent estimation is proposed. This is based on the observation that for defining a rule consequent not all training data within the region of applicability of that rule are equality relevant. Two criteria for selecting a relevant region in the feature space for consequent parameter estimation are proposed. Results show a statistically significant improvement on the performance of probabilistic fuzzy diagnosers trained with the proposed method, independently of the criterion used for defining the relevant region, when compared with the above mentioned state-of-the-art method. Moreover, the proposed consequent parameter estimation method practically has no overhead on the overall training of the diagnoser. Results show that an equilibrium can be found between the model level of detail and its accuracy. However, when accuracy is the sole comparison criterion, the proposed probabilistic fuzzy systems systematically matches the performance of other data-driven models like distance based methods (K-nearest neighbors), connectionists (probabilistic neural networks), or maximum margin classifiers (support vector machines). © 2017","<b>Multilocus molecular identification and phylogenetic analysis of Colletotrichum tamarilloi as the causal agent of Tamarillo (Solanum betaceum) anthracnose in the Ecuadorian highlands<\/b><br><br>Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp., is one of the most serious diseases affecting tamarillo (Solanum betaceum) production in the Ecuadorian highlands. The objective of this study was to characterise Colletotrichum isolates obtained from tamarillo to clarify its taxonomic and phylogenetic position. Based on phenotypic and morphologic characterisation, the isolates of this study were consistently grouped within the Colletotrichum acutatum complex. Multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis based on combined sequences of actin (ACT), β-tubulin (TUB2), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) sequences using Bayesian probabilities, indicated that 16 of 20 isolates from Imbabura, Cotopaxi, Tungurahua, Bolivar, Chimborazo, Azuay and Loja provinces, belonged to C. tamarilloi. This study represents the first reported case of anthracnose of S. betaceum caused by C. tamarilloi in the Ecuadorian highlands. Interestingly, pathogenicity tests and multilocus molecular analysis revealed a new infraspecific and more aggressive species formed by four isolates obtained from the Pichincha province. These findings probably provided interesting information related to mutant isolates and a possible description of a new pathogenic species affecting tamarillo fruits. © 2017, Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.","<b>2b-RAD genotyping for population genomic studies of Chagas disease vectors: Rhodnius ecuadoriensis in Ecuador<\/b><br><br>Background: Rhodnius ecuadoriensis is the main triatomine vector of Chagas disease, American trypanosomiasis, in Southern Ecuador and Northern Peru. Genomic approaches and next generation sequencing technologies have become powerful tools for investigating population diversity and structure which is a key consideration for vector control. Here we assess the effectiveness of three different 2b restriction site-associated DNA (2b-RAD) genotyping strategies in R. ecuadoriensis to provide sufficient genomic resolution to tease apart microevolutionary processes and undertake some pilot population genomic analyses. Methodology/Principal findings: The 2b-RAD protocol was carried out in-house at a non-specialized laboratory using 20 R. ecuadoriensis adults collected from the central coast and southern Andean region of Ecuador, from June 2006 to July 2013. 2b-RAD sequencing data was performed on an Illumina MiSeq instrument and analyzed with the STACKS de novo pipeline for loci assembly and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) discovery. Preliminary population genomic analyses (global AMOVA and Bayesian clustering) were implemented. Our results showed that the 2b-RAD genotyping protocol is effective for R. ecuadoriensis and likely for other triatomine species. However, only BcgI and CspCI restriction enzymes provided a number of markers suitable for population genomic analysis at the read depth we generated. Our preliminary genomic analyses detected a signal of genetic structuring across the study area. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings suggest that 2b-RAD genotyping is both a cost effective and methodologically simple approach for generating high resolution genomic data for Chagas disease vectors with the power to distinguish between different vector populations at epidemiologically relevant scales. As such, 2b-RAD represents a powerful tool in the hands of medical entomologists with limited access to specialized molecular biological equipment. © 2017 Hernandez-Castro et al.","<b>Climate services for health: predicting the evolution of the 2016 dengue season in Machala, Ecuador<\/b><br><br>Background El Niño and its effect on local meteorological conditions potentially influences interannual variability in dengue transmission in southern coastal Ecuador. El Oro province is a key dengue surveillance site, due to the high burden of dengue, seasonal transmission, co-circulation of all four dengue serotypes, and the recent introduction of chikungunya and Zika. In this study, we used climate forecasts to predict the evolution of the 2016 dengue season in the city of Machala, following one of the strongest El Niño events on record. Methods We incorporated precipitation, minimum temperature, and Niño3·4 index forecasts in a Bayesian hierarchical mixed model to predict dengue incidence. The model was initiated on Jan 1, 2016, producing monthly dengue forecasts until November, 2016. We accounted for misreporting of dengue due to the introduction of chikungunya in 2015, by using active surveillance data to correct reported dengue case data from passive surveillance records. We then evaluated the forecast retrospectively with available epidemiological information. Findings The predictions correctly forecast an early peak in dengue incidence in March, 2016, with a 90% chance of exceeding the mean dengue incidence for the previous 5 years. Accounting for the proportion of chikungunya cases that had been incorrectly recorded as dengue in 2015 improved the prediction of the magnitude of dengue incidence in 2016. Interpretation This dengue prediction framework, which uses seasonal climate and El Niño forecasts, allows a prediction to be made at the start of the year for the entire dengue season. Combining active surveillance data with routine dengue reports improved not only model fit and performance, but also the accuracy of benchmark estimates based on historical seasonal averages. This study advances the state-of-the-art of climate services for the health sector, by showing the potential value of incorporating climate information in the public health decision-making process in Ecuador.

The eight currently recognized species occur in the lowlands of South and Central America. Based on the largest taxon and character sampling to date, we analyze three mitochondrial and one nuclear gene using Bayesian methods to (1) infer the phylogeny of Polychrus under both concatenated-tree and speciestree methods; (2) identify lineages that could represent putative undescribed species; and (3) estimate divergence times. Our species tree places P. acutirostris as the sister taxon to all other species of Polychrus. While the phylogenetic position of P. gutturosus and P. peruvianus is poorly resolved, P. marmoratus and P. femoralis are strongly supported as sister to P. liogaster and P. jacquelinae, respectively. Recognition of P. auduboni and P. marmoratus sensu stricto as distinct species indicates that the populations of \"P. marmoratus\" from the Amazon and the Atlantic coast in Brazil represent separate species. Similarly, populations of P. femoralis from the Tumbes region might belong to a cryptic undescribed species. Relative divergence times and published age estimates suggest that the orogeny of the Andes did not play a significant role in the early evolution of Polychrus. © 2017 Torres-Carvajal et al.

Malaria, which has a cyclicality in its dynamics, is closely related to climatic, ecological and socio-economic phenomena. The main objective of this research has been to compare three different prediction species models, the so-called Maxent, logistic regression and multi criteria evaluation with fuzzy logic, in order to determine the model which best describes the ecological niche of the Anopheles spp species, which transmits malaria within Ecuador. After performing a detailed data collection and data processing, we applied the mentioned models and validated them with a statistical analysis in order to discover that the Maxent model has been the model that best defines the distribution of Anopheles spp within the territory. The determined sites, which are of high strategic value and important for the increasing national development, will now be able to initiate preventive countermeasures based on this study. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","<b>Up and down the blind alley: Population divergence with scant gene flow in an endangered tropical lineage of andean palms (ceroxylon quindiuense clade: Ceroxyloideae)<\/b><br><br>Given the geographical complexity of the Andes, species distributions hold interesting information regarding the history of isolation and gene flow across geographic barriers and ecological gradients. Moreover, current threats to the region's enormous plant diversity pose an additional challenge to the understanding of these patterns. We explored the geographic structure of genetic diversity within the Ceroxylon quindiuense species complex (wax palms) at a regional scale, using a model-based approach to disentangle the historical mechanisms by which these species have dispersed over a range encompassing 17 of latitude in the tropical Andes. A total of 10 microsatellite loci were cross-amplified in 8 populations of the 3 species comprising the C. quindiuense complex. Analyses performed include estimates of molecular diversity and genetic structure, testing for genetic bottlenecks and an evaluation of the colonization scenario under approximate Bayesian computation. We showed that there was a geographical diversity gradient reflecting the orogenetic pattern of the northern Andes and its end at the cordilleras facing the Caribbean Sea. A general pattern of diversity suggests that the cordilleras of Colombia have served as historical recipients of gene flow occurring only scantly along the northern Andes. We provided evidence of important isolation between the largest populations of this complex, suggesting that both historical constraints to dispersal but also current anthropogenic effects might explain the high levels of population structuring.

To understand how the reliabilities, sensitivities, and vulnerabilities of reservoir operations vary across hydrogeologic settings, a bottom-up approach was applied to investigate the reliability of two water resources systems in the future. To represent the uncertainty associated with future streamflow, global climate model projections were integrated with a formal Bayesian uncertainty analysis and groundwater-surface water hydrologic modeling. Finally, the effectiveness of variable rule curves for mitigating the effects of climate change was evaluated. Increasing air temperature appeared to reduce the reliability of meeting summer environmental flow targets in the future by 42 and 12% for the groundwater basin and surface water basin, respectively, but had negligible impacts on reservoir refilling and flood regulation. Variable rule curves mitigated the impact of climate change on summer flow target reliability without compromising flood risk reduction. Differences in subbasin sensitivity to changing climate were evident across the two hydrogeologic settings, and uncertainty associated with modeling groundwater resources and decision thresholds were identified, with implications for reliability assessments in other basins. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","<b>Bayesian Networks to predict reputation in Virtual Learning Communities<\/b><br><br>The aim of the paper is to present a Bayesian Network (BN) for predicting reputation of members of Virtual Learning Communities using direct interactions between them considering the theory of the rewards of behavioral Psychology.

In this study, we appraised results from taxonomy, genetics, phylogenetics, phylogeography and pollination ecology to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus Galvezia. Location: Peru, continental Ecuador and Galápagos. Methods: We sequenced the nuclear ribosomal ITS and two plastid regions, ndhF and ndhF-rpL32, to infer the origin of Galvezia and patterns of colonization to and across the Galápagos archipelago, based on Bayesian inference and statistical parsimony analyses. To investigate genetic diversity and differentiation within G. leucantha, we screened the genome of six populations and obtained 194 AFLP fingerprints. Autogamy tests and pollination network analyses were performed to evaluate the colonization potential and to investigate the structure of the pollinators’ assemblage of Galvezia. Results: Relationships of seven nucleotide-substitution haplotypes and 11 nucleotide-substitution ribotypes of Galvezia revealed monophyly for the Galapagos species. Dating estimates indicated divergence of the insular Galvezia lineage in the Middle-Upper Pleistocene (0.66–0.09 Ma). In addition, distribution of genotypes (seven haplotypes, eight ribotypes) across the three continental species showed geographical differentiation, while low differentiation and distribution of G. leucantha. AFLP genetic diversity is relatively high (HT = 0.109), but a low proportion of the total allelic variance is attributed to variation among subspecies/islands (Hb = 0.035, hierarchical AMOVA: 3.77% of total variance). The endemic bee (Xylocopa darwinii) accounted for 87.30% of the floral visits to G. leucantha. Main conclusions: We inferred a single origin for an insular lineage that colonized the Galápagos Islands from northern Peru in the Pleistocene. Recent colonization of the archipelago, Pleistocene land bridges between islands and active gene flow promoted by X. darwinii may account for the low-moderate genetic differentiation of G. leucantha subspecies. An unusual pollination shift from ornithophily (hummingbirds on the continent) to entomophily (Xylocopa in the Galápagos Islands) is supported. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","<b>Reliability, sensitivity, and uncertainty of reservoir performance under climate variability in basins with different hydrogeologic settings in Northwestern United States<\/b><br><br>This study investigated how reservoir performance varied across different hydrogeologic settings and under plausible future climate scenarios. Modelling was conducted for the Santiam River Basin, OR, USA, comparing the North Santiam Basin, with high permeability and extensive groundwater (GW) storage, and the South Santiam Basin, with low permeability, little GW storage, and rapid runoff response. The coupling of projections of future temperature and precipitation from global climate models, a surface water–GW hydrologic model, and a formal Bayesian uncertainty analysis produced synthetic hydrographs of reservoir inflows. Inflow hydrographs were summarized as median and extreme future flows for inputs to a reservoir operations model. The performance of reservoir operations was evaluated as the failure to meet flood management, spring and summer environmental flows, and hydropower generation objectives. Despite projected increases in winter flows and decreases in summer flows, results provided little evidence of a response in reservoir operation performance to a changing climate, with the exception of summer flow targets. Independent of climate impacts, historical prioritization of reservoir operations played an important role in the reliability of flood regulation, demonstrating the importance of reservoir operations relative to hydrologic responses to climate change in this basin. Results also highlight how hydrologic uncertainty is likely to complicate planning for climate change in basins with substantial GW interactions. © 2016 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.","<b>Climate change and the risk of spread of the fungus from the high mortality of Theobroma cocoa in Latin America<\/b><br><br>Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L. 1753) is a plant of great cultural, economic and ecological importance globally. By its structure and function maintains a wide variety of animal species. In Latin America, their crops are being affected by the disease called ‘frosty pod rot of cocoa’ caused by the fungus Moniliophthora roreri (Cif & Par) Evans. 2007, considered as the most destructive disease that attacks cocoa and kills it. The increase of temperature or precipitation because of warming global climate change could favor the fungus expansion to areas previously unaffected. We modeled the potential distribution for M. roreri and T. cocoa using MaxEnt and circulation model general HADCM3, A2a scenario with climatic variables for the present and the future (5, 35 and 65 years), in order to find sites suitable for monitoring to prevent the fungus spread, and to identify which variables determine the presence of M. roreri. The suitable areas for both species overlap from present to 2050, while they are different in 2080. M. roreri could extend from southern Ecuador to Venezuela, spread to westernmost Amazon, southwest Peruvian Amazon, and to the Peruvian-Bolivian border and the adjacent areas of Brazil. In both taxa the most influential variable seems to be precipitation of the wettest month. The Brazilian Amazon is the areas of South America with the largest plantations of T. cocoa, and therefore the most sensitive to the presence and proliferation of the fungus. For this reason we recommend to set up a monitoring system allowing early warning and control of incipient outbreaks that could eventually destroy Bolivian and Brazilian cocoa plantations. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

These strains were spread to United States in 2013 through an intercontinental transmission from China with further spreading across the world, evidencing the emergent nature of these strains. In the present study, an analysis of PEDV field sequences from Ecuador was conducted by comparing all the PEDV S gene sequences available in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic comparisons and Bayesian phylogeographic inference based on complete S gene sequences were also conducted to track the origin and putative route of PEDV. The sequence from the PED-outbreak in Ecuador was grouped into the clade II of PEDV genogroup 2a together with other sequences of isolates from Mexico, Canada, and United States. The phylogeographic study revealed the emergence of the Chinese PEDV strains, followed by spreading to US in 2013, from US to Korea, and later the introduction of PEDV to Canada, Mexico, and Ecuador directly from the US. The sources of imports of live swine in Ecuador in 2014 were mainly from Chile and US. Thus, this movement of pigs is suggested as the main way for introducing PEDV to Ecuador. © 2017 Maritza Barrera et al.","<b>Computation of the nonextensivity parameter in the fragment-asperity model for the Ecuadorian seismic catalog by a Bayesian approach<\/b><br><br>This article shows the application the fragment-asperity interaction theory to the earthquakes catalog of Ecuador. This catalog contains earthquakes generated by an oblique subduction, by the movement of a sliver plate and by several shallow faults. In this scenario, the nonextensive q parameter of the theory is calculated and it is compared with other regions. The q parameter for Ecuador is higher than for other seismic catalogs. We compute the parameter q of two types of seismicity originated in different physical processes: shallow earthquakes and intermediate-depth earthquakes. For the latter, the value of q is slightly higher than for the former. An essential contribution of this article is to show the calculation of the q parameter by an algorithm that solves the inverse problem from a Bayesian approach.","<b>Molecular phylogeny of 42 species of Culicoides (Diptera, Ceratopogonidae) from three continents<\/b><br><br>The genus Culicoides includes vectors of important animal diseases such as bluetongue and Schmallenberg virus (BTV and SBV). This genus includes 1300 species classified in 32 subgenera and 38 unclassified species. However, the phylogenetic relationships between different subgenera of Culicoides have never been studied. Phylogenetic analyses of 42 species belonging to 12 subgenera and 8 ungrouped species of genus Culicoides from Ecuador, France, Gabon, Madagascar and Tunisia were carried out using two molecular markers (28S rDNA D1 and D2 domains and COI mtDNA). Sequences were subjected to non-probabilistic (maximum parsimony) and probabilistic (Bayesian inference (BI)) approaches. The subgenera Monoculicoides, Culicoides, Haematomyidium, Hoffmania, Remmia and Avaritia (including the main vectors of bluetongue disease) were monophyletic, whereas the subgenus Oecacta was paraphyletic. Our study validates the subgenus Remmia (= Schultzei group) as a valid subgenus, outside of the subgenus Oecacta. In Europe, Culicoides obsoletus, Culicoides scoticus and Culicoides chiopterus should be part of the Obsoletus complex whereas Culicoides dewulfi should be excluded from this complex. Our study suggests that the current Culicoides classification needs to be revisited with modern tools. © 2017 D.

Ultimately, data from 37 animals (23 mothers with a calf and 14 unsexed adults) were included in the assessment. Transmissions were filtered and behavior states defined using a Bayesian state-space model. Mean tag longevity was 14.2 d (SD = 12.43; range: 1 to 70 d), and longevity was significantly longer in mothers (53%) than in unsexed individuals (t test = 2.43, p = 0.02). Based on the extent of their movements, two different habitat use patterns were recognized and referred to as short range (SR) and long range (LR). SR movements were associated mainly with slow, area-restricted movements (ARM) and short periods of fast, directed movement (FDM). LR movements were related mainly to FDM and, in some cases, with short ARM periods. We found significant differences in the proportion of time spent in each behavioral mode and in swim speed between mothers and unsexed individuals (p < 0.01, in all cases). Mothers displaying SR movements stayed in relatively small areas with back and forth movements up to 350 km along the coast; the 95% home range (kernel density) was estimated to be 61,105 km2 in whales from Panama and 26,331 km2 in whales from Ecuador. In mothers displaying LR movements, distribution range was seven times greater in Panama and up to 2.5 times greater in Ecuador. Since tag longevity was not significantly different between SR and LR movements in females (t test = 0.063, p > 0.05), a shift from the nursing to migration phase is a plausible explanation for this increased range. Information from unsexed animals is inconclusive because of the short tracking periods. Mothers were distributed closer to shore than other tagged unsexed individuals, but both types of whales swam into deeper waters mainly during migration. Our results confirm maternal-biased stratification in this population along the entire breeding range. These findings have important implications for coastal management, including reduction of risk posed by human activities such as bycatch, ship strikes, and whale watching.","<b>Trophic relationships in apex predators in an estuary system: A multiple-method approximation<\/b><br><br>The trophic level and ecological role of species in the ecosystem are determined by their feeding habits. While the trophic level and niche width are characteristic at population level, trophic overlap indicates the interaction between populations of a community. Three apex predators coexist in Uruguayan waters: Franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei), South American sea lion (SASL, Otaria flavescens) and South American fur seal (SAFS, Arctocephalus australis). The two otariids consume different main prey species and have different isotopic niche, whereas feeding habits of Franciscana dolphin in Uruguayan waters remain practically unknown. This study aimed to determine Franciscana diet composition by stomach content and stable isotope (δ13C and δ15N) analyses, and to assess trophic overlap in diet composition as well as in isotopic niche space among the three apex predators. Diet composition of each species was estimated by Bayesian mixing models with prior information on the diet of predators. Moreover, Bayesian ellipses were used to define the isotopic niche space and overlap among the three species. Diets among predators varied: diet of SAFS was composed mainly by a few pelagic prey species, diet of SASL was more diverse and included pelagic and benthic preys, and for Franciscana dolphin the diet was mainly composed by coastal prey species. The SAFS had the largest isotopic niche area compared to the Franciscana and the SASL. The isotopic niche of the SASL did not overlap with those of the other two species. Although the Franciscana and the SAFS overlap in isotopic space, they do not overlap in feeding areas; this is because particulate organic matter δ13C values increase from inner Rio de la Plata to the estuary and the Atlantic Coast. Here, the relevance of using different sources of information to reach strong conclusions about feeding habits of marine predators and about co-use of resources is shown, mainly in environments where variation in δ13C can be related to diverse reasons. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Divergence of cryptic species of Doryteuthis plei Blainville, 1823 (Loliginidae, Cephalopoda) in the Western Atlantic Ocean is associated with the formation of the Caribbean Sea<\/b><br><br>Although recent years have seen an increase in genetic analyses that identify new species of cephalopods and phylogeographic patterns, the loliginid squid of South America remain one of the least studied groups. The suggestion that Doryteuthis plei may represent distinct lineages within its extensive distribution along the western Atlantic coasts from Cape Hatteras, USA (36°N) to northern Argentina (35°S) is consistent with significant variation in a number of environmental variables along this range including in both temperature and salinity. In the present study D. plei samples were obtained from a large number of localities along the western Atlantic coasts to investigate the distribution of these possible species in a phylogeographic context. Phylogeographic analyses were performed using the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I gene and nuclear Rhodopsin gene. Divergence times were estimated using Bayesian strict clock dating with calibrations based on fossil records for divergence from the lineage containing Vampyroteuthis infernalis (162 mya), the probable origins of the North American loliginids (45 mya), and the European loliginids (20 mya) and fossil statolith from Doryteuthis opalescens (3 mya). Our results suggest a deep genetic divergence within Doryteuthis plei. The currently described specie consists of two genetically distinct clades (pair-wise genetic divergence of between 7.7 and 9.1%). One clade composed of individuals collected in northwestern Atlantic and Central Caribbean Atlantic waters and the other from southwestern Atlantic waters. The divergence time and sampling locations suggest the speciation process at approximately 16 Mya, which is in full agreement with the middle Miocene orogeny of the Caribbean plate, ending up with the formation of the Lesser Antilles and the adjacent subduction zone, coinciding with a particularly low global sea level, resulting in the practical absence of continental shelves at the area, and therefore an effective geographic barrier for D. plei. Furthermore, this study also provides evidence of previously undocumented sub-population structuring in the Gulf of Mexico. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Multilocus species delimitation in Mesoamerican Scaptotrigona stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini) supports the existence of cryptic species<\/b><br><br>Accelerating taxonomic knowledge and making accurate species identifications are critically important given the current biodiversity crisis, particularly in biodiversity hotspots such as Mesoamerica. Objective species delimitation that reduces investigator-driven bias is fundamental to the establishment of appropriate conservation strategies, above all in managed species. Previous morphological and molecular studies on three managed stingless bee species of the genus Scaptotrigona distributed in Mexico (S. mexicana, S. pectoralis and S. hellwegeri) suggested that both S. mexicana and S. hellwegeri are cryptic species complexes. Herein we tested species delimitation by analysing sequence information of five markers (two mitochondrial: cox1 and 16S, and three nuclear: ITS1, EF1-α, ArgK) within a Bayesian coalescent framework to test the putative species. We obtained two different hypotheses using a Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC) model: four (cox1) and six (16S) species. After the species validation step with the Bayesian species-delimitation analysis (BPP), we suggest that only S. mexicana is a complex of two species with different distribution (along the Pacific and the Atlantic coasts, respectively). We highly recommend avoiding colony exchange between geographical regions in order to conserve the genetic integrity of both taxa. © 2016 The Royal Entomological Society","<b>Comparison of the performance and energy consumption index of model-based controllers<\/b><br><br>This paper presents a comparison of the performance of different control algorithms in two types of systems; one exhibiting fast dynamics and the other slow dynamics.

Our idea was to represent each node of the Mesh as a Bayesian network through a set of arcs. Then new BNs are created using (union and difference) operations among sets. For this process, three types of BNs are identified, local optima (BNs with the best score in each neighborhood), global optima (BN with the best score among local optima), and frontier solutions (most and least different in structure BNs). Finally the clearing process is applied to select the most representative BNs in the Mesh (score and structure). For determining the global score, each BN is used as a Bayesian classifier and classification accuracy is obtained using cross validation over dataset.

One of the limitations that are reported in digital databases is the reliability of the records and the lack of information for certain days, weeks, or months. To complete the missing data, the Gibbs algorithm, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure, was used. A feature of precipitation series is that their distribution contains discrete and continuous components implying complicated dynamics. A model is proposed based on a discrete representation of a stochastic integro-difference equation. Given the difficulty of obtaining explicit analytical expressions for the predictive posterior distribution, approximations were obtained using a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm called the parallelized ensemble Kalman filter. The proposed method permits the completion of the missing data in the series where required and secondly allows the splitting of a large database into smaller ones for separate evaluation and eventual combination of the individual results. The objective is to reduce the dimension and computational cost in order to obtain models that are able to describe the reality in real time. It was shown that the obtained models are able to predict spatially and temporally the states of rainfall for at least three to four days quickly, efficiently and accurately. Three methods of statistical validation were used to evaluate the performance of the model and showed no significant discrepancies. Speedup and efficiency factors were calculated to compare the speed of calculation using the parallelized ensemble Kalman filter algorithm with the speed of the sequential version. The improvement in speed for four pthread executions was greatest. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2016.","<b>Potential role of predators on carbon dynamics of marine ecosystems as assessed by a Bayesian belief network<\/b><br><br>While the effects of climate change on top predators are well documented, the role of predation on ecosystem level carbon production is poorly developed, despite it being a logical consequence of trophic dynamics. Trophic cascade effects have shown predator mediated changes in primary production, but we predict that predators should lower the overall biomass capacity of any system with top down control. Through a simple Bayesian belief network model of a typical marine foodweb, we show that predator removal, as is common through activities such as fishing and shark finning, results in higher biomasses of lower trophic level fish and zooplankton, resulting in higher net carbon production by the system. In situations common throughout much of the ocean, where activities such as shark finning and over fishing reduce the highest tropic levels, the probability of net carbon production increasing in the model was ~ 60%, and unlike previous studies on simple food chains, trophic cascade effects were not present. While the results are preliminary, and sources of uncertainty in data and models are acknowledged, such results provide even more strength to the argument to protect open sea fish stocks, and particularly large predators such as sharks, cetaceans and game fish. © 2016 The Authors","<b>Autonomie decision making based on Bayesian networks and ontologies<\/b><br><br>In modern decision making systems, it is necessary to develop ways to optimize the decisions.

We used six orthologues from the nuclear WRKY gene family across 98 accessions to address relationships among species and biogeographical hypotheses. We found that the formerly recognized groups within Attalea are not monophyletic and therefore there is no support for multiple genera as previously thought. Species of Attalea-like palms from the Atlantic forest form a well-supported clade sister to the Attalea species from Amazonia, the Andean valleys and Mesoamerica. Dates for the main divergence events suggest a relationship with the development of the dry forests that now span eastern South America and the now-lost Pebas Lake region in the western Amazon. Attalea crassispatha possibly colonized Hispaniola by a long-distance dispersal event, not via the land bridge Great Antilles Avian Ridge (GAAR), before the Panama channel closed. The common ancestor of Attalea appears to have been an Atlantic forest clade c. 30 Mya. The early split between the Atlantic-forest clade and the two Amazonian-northern Andean clades was probably the result of climatic changes that caused an increase in aridity in South America. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London","<b>Present diversity of Galápagos leaf-toed geckos (Phyllodactylidae: Phyllodactylus) stems from three independent colonization events<\/b><br><br>We re-examined the biogeography of the leaf-toed geckos (Phyllodactylus) endemic to the Galápagos Islands by analyzing for the first time samples of P. gilberti, a species endemic to Wolf island, in a phylogenetic framework. Our aim was to test the three-colonizations scenario previously proposed for these lizards and estimate the age of each colonization event. To achieve this we estimated simultaneously a species tree and divergence times with Bayesian methods. Our results supported the three-colonizations scenario. Similar to a previous hypothesis, the species tree obtained here showed that most species of Phyllodactylus are nested in a single clade with an age between 5.49 and 13.8 Ma, whereas a second independent colonization corresponding to P. darwini from San Cristóbal island occurred 3.03 Ma ago. The species from Wolf island, P. gilberti, stems from a more recent colonization event (0.69 Ma). Thus, present diversity of Galápagos leaf-toed geckos stems from three independent, asynchronous colonization events.

Our data show that genetic diversity was generally lower in the southern part of the range and was especially low in populations closest to cities. We found significant population differentiation (FST = 0.14, DEST = 0.34) and evidence of a genetic bottleneck. Genetic variation did not show isolation by distance. Instead, results suggest genetic barriers around two main cities. Bayesian analysis identified two genetic groups, neither of which represents either of the two varieties previously recognized. Coalescent analysis indicates a relatively recent colonization pattern between the two genetic groups (< 3000 generations). Conservation efforts need to be taken to facilitate genetic exchange between the groups, especially between locations that seem to be genetically isolated. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London","<b>Genetic evidence of the presence of Octopus mimus in the artisanal fisheries of octopus in Santa Elena Peninsula, Ecuador<\/b><br><br>The geographic distribution of Octopus mimus Gould, 1852 is unclear, as most records are restricted to coastal localities of Peru and Chile, and some references have mentioned its presence off Central America. It is unknown whether this octopus is found off Ecuador as two previous unpublished records have suggested. The aim of the present study is to identify genetically the main octopus captured in a marine protected area known as Reserva de Produccion Faunistica Marino-Costera Puntilla de Santa Elena (REMACOPSE) off the Santa Elena peninsula, Ecuador. Samples collected from the local fishery were used to test the presence of this species based on the sequences of three mitochondrial markers and using a Bayesian approach. The phylogenetic analysis confirms that O. mimus inhabits the REMACOPSE. The results also indicate that the octopus specimens captured in the fishery from this marine protected area, are more closely related to O. mimus specimens from Central America than those from South America. The genetic identification of two groups of O. mimus could be associated with the different marine environmental conditions of the two biogeographic provinces. The finding in this study represents an important step for posterior research on the biology and fishery of octopus in Ecuador.","<b>Phylogenetic relationships in Mormodes (Orchidaceae, Cymbidieae, Catasetinae) inferred from nuclear and plastid DNA sequences and morphology<\/b><br><br>Interspecific phylogenetic relationships in the Neotropical orchid genus Mormodes were assessed by means of maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian inference (BI) analyses of non-coding nuclear ribosomal (nrITS) and plastid (trnL–trnF) DNA sequences and 24 morphological characters for 36 species of Mormodes and seven additional outgroup species of Catasetinae. The bootstrap (>50%) consensus trees of the MP analyses of each separate dataset differed in the degree of resolution and overall clade support, but there were no contradicting groups with strong bootstrap support. MP and BI combined analyses recovered similar relationships, with the notable exception of the BI analysis not resolving section Mormodes as monophyletic. However, sections Coryodes and Mormodes were strongly and weakly supported as monophyletic by the MP analysis, respectively, and each has diagnostic morphological characters and different geographical distribution. The geographic structure reflected by the recovered phylogenetic patterns suggests that it is possible to undertake taxonomic revision of regional clades, which eventually will lead to a thorough revision of the genus. © 2016 Magnolia Press.","<b>Genomic Bayesian prediction model for count data with genotype × environment interaction<\/b><br><br>Genomic tools allow the study of the whole genome, and facilitate the study of genotype-environment combinations and their relationship with phenotype. However, most genomic prediction models developed so far are appropriate for Gaussian phenotypes. For this reason, appropriate genomic prediction models are needed for count data, since the conventional regression models used on count data with a large sample size (nT) and a small number of parameters (p) cannot be used for genomic-enabled prediction where the number of parameters (p) is larger than the sample size (nT). Here, we propose a Bayesian mixed-negative binomial (BMNB) genomic regression model for counts that takes into account genotype by environment (G×E) interaction. We also provide all the full conditional distributions to implement a Gibbs sampler. We evaluated the proposed model using a simulated data set, and a real wheat data set from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and collaborators. Results indicate that our BMNB model provides a viable option for analyzing count data. © 2016 Montesinos-López et al.","<b>Comparative phylogeography reveals cryptic diversity and repeated patterns of cladogenesis for amphibians and reptiles in northwestern Ecuador<\/b><br><br>Comparative phylogeography allow us to understand how shared historical circumstances have shaped the formation of lineages, by examining a broad spectrum of co-distributed populations of different taxa. However, these types of studies are scarce in the Neotropics, a region that is characterized by high diversity, complex geology, and poorly understood biogeography. Here, we investigate the diversification patterns of five lineages of amphibians and reptiles, co-distributed across the Choco and Andes ecoregions in northwestern Ecuador. Mitochondrial DNA and occurrence records were used to determine the degree of geographic genetic divergence within species. Our results highlight congruent patterns of parapatric speciation and common geographical barriers for distantly related taxa. These comparisons indicate similar biological and demographic characteristics for the included clades, and reveal the existence of two new species of Pristimantis previously subsumed under P. walkeri, which we describe herein. Our data supports the hypothesis that widely distributed Chocoan taxa may generally experience their greatest opportunities for isolation and parapatric speciation across thermal elevational gradients. Finally, our study provides critical information to predict which unstudied lineages may harbor cryptic diversity, and how geology and climate are likely to have shaped their evolutionary history. © 2016 Arteaga et al.

Yet, the lack of a robust phylogenetic framework for Catasetinae has hampered deeper insights in origin and evolution of sexual systems. To investigate the origins of protandry and ESD in Catasetinae, we sequenced nuclear and chloroplast loci from 77 species, providing the most extensive data matrix of Catasetinae available so far with all major lineages represented. We used Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian methods to infer phylogenetic relationships and evolution of sexual systems. Irrespectively of the methods used, Catasetinae were monophyletic in molecular phylogenies, with all established generic lineages and their relationships resolved and highly supported. According to comparative reconstruction approaches, the last common ancestor of Catasetinae was inferred as having bisexual flowers (i.e., lacking protandry and ESD as well), and protandry originated once in core Catasetinae (comprising Catasetum, Clowesia, Cycnoches, Dressleria and Mormodes). In addition, three independent gains of ESD are reliably inferred, linked to corresponding loss of protandry within core Catasetinae. Thus, prior gain of protandry appears as the necessary prerequisite for gain of ESD in orchids. Our results contribute to a comprehensive evolutionary scenario for sexual systems in Catasetinae and more generally in orchids as well. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Serodiagnosis of bovine trypanosomosis caused by non-tsetse transmitted Trypanosoma (Duttonella) vivax parasites using the soluble form of a Trypanozoon variant surface glycoprotein antigen<\/b><br><br>Previous studies have shown that a 64-kDa antigen (p64) that was purified from the Venezuelan TeAp-N/D1 isolate of Trypanosoma (Trypanozoon) equiperdum corresponds to the soluble form of its predominant variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), and exhibited cross-reactivity with Trypanosoma (Duttonella) vivax. The course of experimental acute infections of bovines with T. vivax were followed by measuring whole anti-p64 antibodies and specific anti-p64 IgG and IgM antibodies in animal sera by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The value of p64 to diagnose bovine trypanosomosis was also examined using 350 sera from healthy and T. vivax-infected cows living in a trypanosomosis-endemic and enzootic stable area, and 48 sera obtained during a trypanosomosis outbreak. Serological assays showed that ~70-80% of the infected sera contained anti-p64 antibodies, based on the comparative immunodetection of the T. equiperdum clarified antigenic fraction used as a reference test. In the absence of a gold standard, Bayesian analysis for multiple testing estimated a sensitivity and specificity of 71.6% and 98.8%, respectively, for the indirect ELISA using p64 as antigen. An apparent prevalence of 37.7% for bovine trypanosomosis infection was also estimated with a Bayesian approach when the p64 ELISA test was used. Employing blood from acute infected cows, the indirect ELISA response against p64 was contrasted with the microhematocrit centrifuge method and analyses by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers targeting the inter-specific length variation of the internal transcribed spacer 1 region of the 18S ribosomal gene. The efficiency of p64 for the detection of anti-trypanosome antibodies in acute infected bovines was also corroborated serologically by comparing its response to that of the Indonesian Trypanosoma evansi Rode Trypanozoon antigen type (RoTat) 1.2 VSG, which possesses high specificity and sensitivity. As expected, PCR was the best method to detect parasites and diagnose bovine trypanosomosis; however, a substantial level of concordance (Cohen's κ = 0.667) was obtained when serological tests using p64 and RoTat 1.2 VSG were compared. Additionally, an agglutination assay was designed using p64 covalently coupled to carboxylate-modified latex microparticles, which was proven here to be suitable for a fast qualitative diagnosis of bovine trypanosomosis. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Analysis of the cosmopolitan buckthorn genera Frangula and Rhamnus s.l. supports the description of a new genus, Ventia<\/b><br><br>The taxonomy of the species-rich and widespread Rhamnus s.l. is partially unresolved.

Adults of these species inhabit the intestine of cormorants of the genus Nannopterum, whereas larval forms (metacercariae) are found in the eyes (vitreous humor) of freshwater fishes. Records of both species have been established across a wide geographic range in the Americas. Diplostomid adults and metacercariae were collected from a wide geographical range that spans from south-eastern Mexico, southwards to Central and South America. Even though the diplostomid has been largely reported in Mexico as Diplostomum (Austrodiplostomum) compactum, our specimens were identified morphologically as A. ostrowskiae. Sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase (cox 1) were obtained for 86 individuals, including 15 adults recovered from the intestine of Nannopterum brasilianus, in five localities, and 71 metacercariae from the eyes of ten fish species, in 13 localities. Sequences were used to evaluate the genetic diversity, and to test conspecificity of these specimens with the available sequence of A. ostrowskiae. Sequences were aligned with another 12 taxa representing five genera of Diplostomatidae, forming a dataset of 104 taxa with 478 nucleotides. The genetic divergence estimated among the 86 sequenced individuals, and that of A. ostrowskiae from the double-crested cormorant, Nannopterum auritus, in the USA, was very low, ranging from 0 to 0.8%. The maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian consensus trees showed that all sequences nested within a monophyletic lineage, with strong bootstrap and Bayesian posterior probability support values (100/1.0). In conclusion, a link between the metacercariae in fish and the adults in cormorants was established, indicating also that a single species is found in the distribution range comprising southern USA, southwards to Venezuela. Previous records of this species, particularly from Mexico, need to be corrected. © 2015 Cambridge University Press.","<b>An integrated evaluation of potential management processes on marine reserves in continental Ecuador based on a Bayesian belief network model<\/b><br><br>Evaluating potential effects of conservation and management actions in marine reserves requires an understanding not only of the biological processes in the reserve, and between the reserve and the surrounding ocean, but also of the effects of the wildlife on the wider political and economic processes. Such evaluations are made considerably more difficult in the absence of good ecological data from within reserves or consistent data between reserves and the wider marine environment, as is the case in much of mainland Ecuador. We present an approach to evaluate the effects of a wide range of possible management processes on the marine ecology of the Machalilla National Park, as well as that of the surrounding marine environments (including recently established reserves) and related socio-economic pressures. The approach is based on Bayesian belief networks, and as such can be used in the presence of sparse data from multiple and disparate sources. We show that currently there are no observable benefits of marine reserves to reef and fish community structure, and that high value (normally predatory) fish, which are sought by fishers and shark finners are frequently absent from reef systems. We demonstrate that there is broad similarity in ecological communities between most shallow marine systems, in or out of marine reserves, and predict there can be a strong effect from actions outside the reserve on what is present within it. We also show that establishing a stronger link between (responsible) ecotourism and the marine environment could reduce the need for income in other more destructive areas, such as fishing and particularly shark finning, and discuss ways that high value, low impact eco-tourism could be introduced. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","<b>Mimetic divergence and the speciation continuum in the mimic poison frog ranitomeya imitator<\/b><br><br>While divergent ecological adaptation can drive speciation, understanding the factors that facilitate or constrain this process remains a major goal in speciation research. Here, we study two mimetic transition zones in the poison frog Ranitomeya imitator, a species that has undergone a Müllerian mimetic radiation to establish four morphs in Peru. We find that mimetic morphs are strongly phenotypically differentiated, producing geographic clines with varying widths. However, distinct morphs show little neutral genetic divergence, and landscape genetic analyses implicate isolation by distance as the primary determinant of among-population genetic differentiation. Mate choice experiments suggest random mating at the transition zones, although certain allopatric populations show a preference for their own morph. We present evidence that this preference may be mediated by color pattern specifically. These results contrast with an earlier study of a third transition zone, in which a mimetic shift was associated with reproductive isolation. Overall, our results suggest that the three known mimetic transition zones in R. imitator reflect a speciation continuum, which we have characterized at the geographic, phenotypic, behavioral, and genetic levels. We discuss possible explanations for variable progress toward speciation, suggesting that multifarious selection on both mimetic color pattern and body size may be responsible for generating reproductive isolation. © 2015 by The University of Chicago.

First, classical learning algorithms, as PC or K2 are reviewed. But the problem with these general learning procedures comes from the presence of a high number of variables that measure different aspects of the same concept, as it can be the case of socio-economic indicators in a population. In this case, we have that all the variables have some degree of dependence among them, without a true causal structure. So, a new procedure is presented which makes a hierarchical clustering of the data while learning a joint probability distribution. It generalizes AutoClass EM clustering allowing more complex models. Hierarchical clustering is compared in the experiments with classical learning algorithms showing a similar performance when considering the estimation of a joint probability distribution for all the variables, but with a clear advantage: the simplicity and easiness of the interpretation of the model.

T. ventricosus and L. variegatus are associated with seagrass beds, while the other three species usually inhabit hardground substrates. Food preferences of these species are well documented and they are commonly accepted as being primarily herbivorous-omnivorous; nevertheless, few of them have previously been characterized isotopically. We used this approach for assessing the isotopic characterization of five echinoids. We established the trophic position of two groups of co-occurring species and quantified the contribution of food resources in the diet of Echinometra lucunter, considered the most common sea urchin in the Caribbean region. The species T. ventricosus and D. antillarum showed the highest values of δ15N. Sea urchins exhibited similar values of δ13C varying from -11.6 ± 0.63 to -10.4 ± 0.99%. The echinoid E. lucunter displayed the lowest values of carbon, from -15.40 ± 0.76%. Significant differences among species were found for δ15N and δ13C. Seaweed communities exhibited no differences among sites for overall δ15N (F= 1.300, df= 3, p= 0.301), but we found spatial differences for δ13C (F= 7.410, df= 3, p= 0.001). The ellipse-based metrics of niche width analysis found that the hardground biotope species (D. antillarum, E. lucunter, and E. viridis) did not overlap each other. Similar results were obtained for the co-occurring species of the seagrass biotope; however, the distance between these species was closer than that of the hardground biotope species. The Bayesian mixing models run for E. lucunter at all four localities found differences in food resources contribution. The algae D. menstrualis, C. crassa and B. triquetrum dominated in CGD; whereas C. nitens, Gracilaria spp., and D. caribaea represented the main contributor algae to the diet of E. lucunter at LQY. In Culebra Island, no dominance of any particular algae was detected in TMD, where six of the eight species exhibited a similar contribution. Similarities in δ15N between D. antillarum and T. ventricosus may hint towards a similar trophic level for these species, although T. ventricosus is widely accepted as an omnivore, while D. antillarum is considered a generalist herbivore. The lack of overlap among species in the two biotopes seems to indicate a resource partitioning strategy to avoid niche competition among co-occurring species. © 2016 Universidad de Costa Rica.

Knowing the probability of droughts might help to optimize a priori the planning and management of the water resources in general and of the Andean watersheds in particular. This study compares Markov chain- (MC) and Bayesian network- (BN) based models in drought forecasting using a recently developed drought index with respect to their capability to characterize different drought severity states. The copula functions were used to solve the BNs and the ranked probability skill score (RPSS) to evaluate the performance of the models. Monthly rainfall and streamflow data of the Chulco River basin, located in Southern Ecuador, were used to assess the performance of both approaches. Global evaluation results revealed that the MC-based models predict better wet and dry periods, and BN-based models generate slightly more accurately forecasts of the most severe droughts. However, evaluation of monthly results reveals that, for each month of the hydrological year, either the MC- or BN-based model provides better forecasts. The presented approach could be of assistance to water managers to ensure that timely decision-making on drought response is undertaken. © 2016 by the authors.","<b>Stable isotopes reveal long-Term fidelity to foraging grounds in the galapagos sea lion zalophus wollebaeki)<\/b><br><br>Most otariids have colony-specific foraging areas during the breeding season, when they behave as central place foragers. However, they may disperse over broad areas after the breeding season and individuals from different colonies may share foraging grounds at that time. Here, stable isotope ratios in the skull bone of adult Galapagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki) were used to assess the long-Term fidelity of both sexes to foraging grounds across the different regions of the Galapagos archipelago. Results indicated that the stable isotope ratios (δ13C and δ15N) of sea lion bone significantly differed among regions of the archipelago, without any significant difference between sexes and with a non significant interaction between sex and region. Moreover, standard ellipses, estimated by Bayesian inference and used as a measure of the isotopic resource use area at the population level, overlapped widely for the sea lions from the southern and central regions, whereas the overlap of the ellipses for sea lions from the central and western regions was small and nonexisting for those from the western and southern regions. These results suggest that males and females from the same region within the archipelago use similar foraging grounds and have similar diets. Furthermore, they indicate that the exchange of adults between regions is limited, thus revealing a certain degree of foraging philopatry at a regional scale within the archipelago. The constraints imposed on males by an expanded reproductive season (~ 6 months), resulting from the weak reproductive synchrony among females, and those imposed on females by a very long lactation period (at least one year but up to three years), may explain the limited mobility of adult Galapagos sea lions of both sexes across the archipelago. © 2016 Drago et al.

First, a hidden Markov model is used to diagnose four states that play distinct roles in the December-May rainy season. The estimated daily states fall into two wet states, one dry state, and one transitional dry-wet state, and show a systematic seasonal evolution together with intraseasonal and interannual variability. The first wet state represents regionwide wet conditions, while the second one represents north-south gradients. The former could be associated with the annual moisture offshore of the PAEP, thermally driven by the climatological maximum of sea surface temperatures in the Niño-1.2 region. The latter corresponds with the dynamically noisy component of the PAEP rainfall signal, associated with the annual displacement of the intertropical convergence zone. Then, a four-state NHMM is coupled with GCM information to simulate daily sequences at each station. Simulations of the GCM-NHMM approach represent daily rainfall characteristics at station level well. The best skills were found in reproducing the interannual variation of seasonal rainfall amount and mean intensity at the regional-averaged level with correlations equal to 0.60 and 0.64, respectively. At catchment level, the best skills appear over catchments south of 48S, where hydrologically relevant characteristics are well simulated. It is thus shown that the GCM-NHMM approach provides the potential to produce precipitation information relevant for hydrological prediction in this climate-sensitive region. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","<b>Trophic ecology of sea urchins in coral-rocky reef systems, Ecuador<\/b><br><br>Sea urchins are important grazers and influence reef development in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP). Diadema mexicanum and Eucidaris thouarsii are the most important sea urchins on the Ecuadorian coastal reefs. This study provided a trophic scenario for these two species of echinoids in the coral-rocky reef bottoms of the Ecuadorian coast, using stable isotopes. We evaluated the relative proportion of algal resources assimilated, and trophic niche of the two sea urchins in the most southern coral-rocky reefs of the ETP in two sites with different disturbance level. Bayesian models were used to estimate the contribution of algal sources, niche breadth, and trophic overlap between the two species. The sea urchins behaved as opportunistic feeders, although they showed differential resource assimilation. Eucidaris thouarsii is the dominant species in disturbed environments; likewise, their niche amplitude was broader than that of D. mexicanum when conditions were not optimal. However, there was no niche overlap between the species. The Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR) indicated that both sea urchins shared limiting resources in the disturbed area, mainly Dictyota spp. (contributions of up to 85% for D. mexicanum and up to 75% for E. thouarsii). The Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R (SIBER) analysis results indicated less interspecific competition in the undisturbed site. Our results suggested a trophic niche partitioning between sympatric sea urchin species in coastal areas of the ETP, but the limitation of resources could lead to trophic overlap and stronger habitat degradation. © 2016 Cabanillas-Terán et al.","<b>Multi-criteria decision making: The best choice for the modeling of chemicals against hyper-pigmentation?<\/b><br><br>Classifier ensembles appeared to be powerful alternative for handling a difficult problem. It is rapidly growing and enjoying many attentions from pattern recognition and machine learning communities. In the present report, the potential of multi-criteria decision making via multiclassifier approaches is assessed by applying them in the modeling of chemicals against hyper-pigmentation. TOMOCOMD-CARDD atom-based quadratic indices are used as descriptors to parameterize the molecular structures. Support vector machine, artificial neural network, Bayesian network, binary logistic regression, instance-based learning and tree classification applied on two collected datasets are explored as standalone classifiers. Prediction sets (PSs) are used to assess the performance of multiclassifier systems (MCSs). A strategy exploiting the principal component analysis together with pairwise diversity measures is designed to select the most diverse base classifiers to combine. Various trainable and nontrainable systems are developed that aggregate, at the abstract and continuous levels, the outputs of base classifiers. The obtained results are rather encouraging since the MCSs generally enhance the performance of the base classifiers; e.g. the best MCS obtains global accuracy of 95.51%, 88.89% in the PS for the data I and II in regard to 94.12% and 85.93% of best individual classifier, respectively. Our results suggest that the MCSs could be the best choice till the moment to obtain suitable QSAR models for the prediction of depigmenting agents. Finally, we consider these approaches will aid improving the virtual screening procedures and increasing the practicality of data mining of chemical datasets for the discovery of novel lead compounds. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.","<b>How to describe species richness patterns for bryophyte conservation?<\/b><br><br>A large amount of data for inconspicuous taxa is stored in natural history collections; however, this information is often neglected for biodiversity patterns studies. Here, we evaluate the performance of direct interpolation of museum collections data, equivalent to the traditional approach used in bryophyte conservation planning, and stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs) to produce reliable reconstructions of species richness patterns, given that differences between these methods have been insufficiently evaluated for inconspicuous taxa. Our objective was to contrast if species distribution models produce better inferences of diversity richness than simply selecting areas with the higher species numbers. As model species, we selected Iberian species of the genus Grimmia (Bryophyta), and we used four well-collected areas to compare and validate the following models: 1) four Maxent richness models, each generated without the data from one of the four areas, and a reference model created using all of the data and 2) four richness models obtained through direct spatial interpolation, each generated without the data from one area, and a reference model created with all of the data. The correlations between the partial and reference Maxent models were higher in all cases (0.45 to 0.99), whereas the correlations between the spatial interpolation models were negative and weak (-0.3 to -0.06). Our results demonstrate for the first time that S-SDMs offer a useful tool for identifying detailed richness patterns for inconspicuous taxa such as bryophytes and improving incomplete distributions by assessing the potential richness of under-surveyed areas, filling major gaps in the available data. In addition, the proposed strategy would enhance the value of the vast number of specimens housed in biological collections. © 2015 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","<b>Phylogeny of Neotropical Cercosaura (Squamata: Gymnophthalmidae) lizards<\/b><br><br>Among Neotropical lizards, the geographically widespread gymnophthalmid Cercosaura as currently defined includes lowland and highland taxa from Panama to Argentina, with some species occurring in the northern Andes. In this study we analyze three mitochondrial (12S, 16S, ND4) and one nuclear (c-mos) gene using Bayesian methods to clarify the phylogenetic relationships among most species of Cercosaura based on a well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis that also includes a large sample of other taxa within Cercosaurini. The phylogenetic tree obtained in this paper shows that Cercosaura as currently defined is not monophyletic. Two species from the northern Andes (C. dicra and C. vertebralis) are nested within Pholidobolus, which has been formerly recognized as a major radiation along the Andes of Ecuador and Colombia. Therefore, Cercosaura has probably not diversified in the northern Andes, although the phylogenetic position of C. hypnoides from the Andes of Colombia remains unknown. Tree topology and genetic distances support both recognition of C. ocellata bassleri as a distinct species, C. bassleri, and recognition of C. argula and C. oshaughnessyi as two different species. In the interest of promoting clarity and precision regarding the names of clades of gymnophthalmid lizards, we propose a phylogenetic definition of Cercosaura. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Distribution and Potential Indicators of Hospitalized Cases of Neurocysticercosis and Epilepsy in Ecuador from 1996 to 2008<\/b><br><br>Background: Epilepsy is one of the most common signs of Neurocysticercosis (NCC). In this study, spatial and temporal variations in the incidence of hospitalized cases (IHC) of epilepsy and NCC in Ecuadorian municipalities were analyzed. Additionally, potential socio-economic and landscape indicators were evaluated in order to understand in part the macro-epidemiology of the Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis complex. Methodology: Data on the number of hospitalized epilepsy and NCC cases by municipality of residence were obtained from morbidity-hospital systems in Ecuador. SatScan software was used to determine whether variations in the IHC of epilepsy and NCC in space and time. In addition, several socio-economic and landscape variables at municipality level were used to study factors intervening in the macro-epidemiology of these diseases. Negative Binomial regression models through stepwise selection and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) were used to explain the variations in the IHC of epilepsy and NCC. Principal findings: Different clusters were identified through space and time. Traditional endemic zones for NCC and epilepsy, recognized in other studies were confirmed in our study. However, for both disorders more recent clusters were identified. Among municipalities, an increasing tendency for IHC of epilepsy, and a decreasing tendency for the IHC of NCC were observed over time. In contrast, within municipalities a positive linear relationship between both disorders was found. An increase in the implementation of systems for eliminating excrements would help to reduce the IHC of epilepsy by 1.00% (IC95%; 0.2%–1.8%) and by 5.12% (IC95%; 3.63%-6.59%) for the IHC of NCC. The presence of pig production was related to IHC of NCC. Conclusion/Significance: Both disorders were related to the lack of an efficient system for eliminating excrements. Given the appearance of recent epilepsy clusters, these locations should be studied in depth to discriminate epilepsies due to NCC from epilepsies due to other causes. Field studies are needed to evaluate the true prevalence of cysticercosis in humans and pigs in different zones of the country in order to better implement and manage prevention and/or control campaigns. © 2015 Ron-Garrido et al.","<b>Conservation status assessment of Paraphlebia damselflies in Mexico<\/b><br><br>We assessed the conservation status of the three Mexican Paraphlebia damselflies based on the criterion B of the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN): P. hyalina, P. quinta, and P. zoe. According to this List, P. hyalina has not been evaluated, P. quinta appears as least concern, and P. zoe appears as Vulnerable. Geographical records were taken from literature, enquiries to specialists and field visits. We also projected the future potential geographical range area. We generated species distribution models (SDM) for P. quinta and P. zoe (as there were not enough records for P. hyalina) as a surrogate of the extension of occurrence (EOO) and also calculated the area of occupancy. Future distributions were projected for years 2020, 2050, and, 2080 based on predicted changes in climatic conditions. Species distribution models predicted current EOO areas for P. quinta and P. zoe as 18 860 and 16 440 km2, respectively, and around 50% of their distribution coincides with agricultural, pasture or urban sites. Our SDM results indicate that IUCN-based conservation status of the three species should be changed as follows: P. quinta and P. zoe moved to endangered category, and P. hyalina to data-deficient category based on the reduced EOO areas and the historical loss of habitat. For P. quinta, future climatic projections suggest an initial reduction (2020) followed by an expansion (2050 and 2080) in suitable areas, whereas for P. zoe there will be a decrease in predicted area for the three time periods. Preserving areas that provide shade, high humidity and perching sites seems to be a key for Paraphlebia species survival. © 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.","<b>Bayesian belief network models to analyse and predict ecological water quality in rivers<\/b><br><br>Economic growth is often based on the intensification of crop production, energy consumption and urbanization. In many cases, this leads to the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Modelling water resources and the related identification of key drivers of change are essential to improve and protect water quality in river basins. This study evaluates the potential of Bayesian belief network models to predict the ecological water quality in a typical multifunctional and tropical river basin. Field data, expert knowledge and literature data were used to develop a set of Bayesian belief network models. The developed models were evaluated based on weighted Cohen's Kappa (κw), percentage of correctly classified instances (CCI) and spherical payoff. On top, a sensitivity analysis and practical simulation tests of the two most reliable models were performed. Cross-validation based on κw (Model 1: 0.44±0.08; Model 2: 0.44±0.11) and CCI (Model 1: 36.3±2.3; Model 2: 41.6±2.3) indicated that the performance was reliable and stable. Model 1 comprised of input variables main land use, elevation, sediment type, chlorophyll, flow velocity, dissolved oxygen, and chemical oxygen demand; whereas Model 2 did not include dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand. Although the predictive performance of Model 2 was slightly higher than that of Model 1, simulation outcomes of Model 1 were more coherent. Additionally, more management options could be evaluated with Model 1. As the model's ability to simulate management outcomes is of utmost importance in model selection, Model 1 is recommended as a tool to support decision-making in river management. Model predictions and sensitivity analysis indicated that flow velocity is the major variable determining ecological water quality and suggested that construction of additional dams and water abstraction within the basin would have an adverse effect on water quality. Although a case study in a single river basin is presented, the modelling approach can be of general use on any other river basin. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Palm diversification in two geologically contrasting regions of western Amazonia<\/b><br><br>Aim: The subduction of the Nazca Plate and the eastward propagation of the Andean orogenic wedge in western Amazonia caused the formation of arches or ridges that have influenced the modern configuration of the upper Amazon drainage and the diversification of biota. We used a lineage of 15 palm species (Astrocaryum sect. Huicungo, Arecaceae) to test two biogeographical hypotheses for lowland plants: (1) that vicariance resulted from tectonically mediated geographical barriers (population contraction), and (2) that recurrent dispersal events (population expansion) produced geographical isolation and subsequent speciation. Location: Rain forests of South America. Methods: A total of 78 palm individuals were collected in the field, from which five chloroplast and two nuclear DNA fragments were sequenced. We reconstructed a Bayesian dated phylogeny and inferred the demographic history. We used a Bayesian phylogeographical spatial diffusion approach to propose a model of colonization. Results: We found a phylogeographical break at c. 5° S between two main clades with crown ages of c. 6.7 and 7.3 Ma located in the Fitzcarrald Arch (FA) and the subsiding northern Amazonian foreland basin (NAFB), respectively. These diversification times were close to the emergence of the FA in the late Miocene, and the coeval development of the transcontinental modern drainage and sedimentation plain of the NAFB. As expected for the recurrent-dispersal hypothesis, lineage delimitations were spatially inconsistent with the location of rivers or ridges, and we found some evidence of past ancestral population expansion supported particularly by the chloroplast sequences. Main conclusions: Our results support the biogeographical scenario whereby recurrent dispersal into western Amazonia produced spatial isolation of populations, followed by speciation within two areas of contrasting geological activity: tectonic uplift in the FA versus subsidence in the NAFB. We did not test and cannot rule out ecological speciation within western Amazonia or at finer spatial scales. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","<b>Genetic structure of the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) in the Old World reveals a strong differentiation between eastern and western populations<\/b><br><br>Background and Aims Date palms (Phoenix dactylifera, Arecaceae) are of great economic and ecological value to the oasis agriculture of arid and semi-arid areas. However, despite the availability of a large date palm germplasm spreading from the Atlantic shores to Southern Asia, improvement of the species is being hampered by a lack of information on global genetic diversity and population structure. In order to contribute to the varietal improvement of date palms and to provide new insights on the influence of geographic origins and human activity on the genetic structure of the date palm, this study analysed the diversity of the species. Methods Genetic diversity levels and population genetic structure were investigated through the genotyping of a collection of 295 date palm accessions ranging from Mauritania to Pakistan using a set of 18 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and a plastid minisatellite. Key Results Using a Bayesian clustering approach, the date palm genotypes can be structured into two different gene pools: the first, termed the Eastern pool, consists of accessions from Asia and Djibouti, whilst the second, termed the Western pool, consists of accessions from Africa. These results confirm the existence of two ancient gene pools that have contributed to the current date palm diversity. The presence of admixed genotypes is also noted, which points at gene flows between eastern and western origins, mostly from east to west, following a human-mediated diffusion of the species. Conclusions This study assesses the distribution and level of genetic diversity of accessible date palm resources, provides new insights on the geographic origins and genetic history of the cultivated component of this species, and confirms the existence of at least two domestication origins. Furthermore, the strong genetic structure clearly established here is a prerequisite for any breeding programme exploiting the effective polymorphism related to each gene pool. © 2015 The Author.

Here, we examine historical demographic trends for six species of milksnake with representatives in both the temperate and tropical Americas to determine if species share responses to climate change as a taxon or by area (i.e., temperate versus tropical environments). Using a multilocus dataset, we test for the demographic signature of population expansion and decline using non-genealogical summary statistics, as well as coalescent-based methods. In addition, we determine whether range sizes are correlated with effective population sizes for milksnakes. Results indicate that there are no identifiable trends with respect to demographic response based on location, and that species responded to changing climates independently, with tropical taxa showing greater instability. There is also no correlation between range size and effective population size, with the largest population size belonging to the species with the smallest geographic distribution. Our study highlights the importance of not generalizing the demographic histories of taxa by region and further illustrates that the New World tropics may not have been a stable refuge during the Pleistocene. © 2015 Ruane et al.

Despite its cultural and commercial significance, limited information exists with regards to the degree of genetic variation and ecological history of P. serotina in Ecuador. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the degree of genetic diversity and population structure of Ecuadorian P. serotina, as a preliminary step towards understanding the distribution history of this species in Ecuador and establishing germplasm conservation programs. P. serotina samples (217, representing 8 provinces from the Ecuadorian highlands) were characterized using 8 heterologous SSR markers derived from related Prunus species. Expected heterozygosity across samples (He=0.71) reveals a moderate level of genetic diversity for Ecuadorian P. serotina. Nevertheless, simple allele-count analysis indicates that Ecuadorian capuli has a narrower degree of allelic richness relative to collections from the species' center of origin in North America. Furthermore, pairwise F statistics (0.0069≤Fst≤0.0319) and Nei genetic distance estimates (0.02≤Ds≤0.09) indicate minimal population differentiation within Ecuadorian capuli. However, Bayesian population structure analysis suggests a subtle genetic contrast between germplasm from the Northern and Southern highlands. Certainly, it is of interest to analyze whether this underlying genetic differentiation between the Northern- and Southern-Highland groups is also manifested in morphological, agronomic or other phenotypic characters that could indicate adaptive differences to divergent agro-ecosystems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","<b>Feeding patterns of age-0 bluefin tuna in the Western Mediterranean inferred from stomach-content and isotope analyses<\/b><br><br>Knowing how migratory pelagic predators use food web resources during early life stages is essential for understanding population dynamics and recruitment. Feeding habits of ∼3 to 4 mo old Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT) Thunnus thynnus from 2 Mediterranean nearshore areas (Cartagena and Cambrils, Spain) showing distinct oceanographic features were investigated using stomach-content (SCA) and stable-isotope (SIA) analyses. SCA showed diet variability between areas and years; further correspondence analysis revealed that epipelagic fishes (primarily anchovy and sardine) constitute the staple diet of age-0 ABFT in Cambrils, whereas mesopelagic fishes (especially myctophids) and squid were consumed in significant amounts by ABFT in Cartagena. δ13C values differed significantly between tissues (white muscle and liver), areas and years (2009 and 2010), while δ15N values were not significantly different. In all cases, mean δ13C values were significantly higher in muscle than in liver, while differences in δ13C between locations and years were also observed in some instances. Estimations of trophic niche width using the antilogarithm of Shannon's entropy, exp(H), and from stable isotope Bayesian ellipses, SEAc, indicated that niche width was generally larger in samples from Cambrils than in those from Cartagena. Moreover, SEAc analysis suggested that trophic niches were broader in 2010 than in 2009. Our results indicate a low degree of feeding specialisation and suggest that, like older classes, age-0 ABFT rely on a wide prey range, easily adapting their foraging behaviour to prey availability and distribution in the habitat. This research assesses the potential of using stable isotope techniques combined with SCA for the characterization of spatio-temporal variability in the diet of juvenile top predators. © Inter-Research 2015.","<b>Sexual foraging segregation in South American sea lions increases during the pre-breeding period in the Río de la Plata plume<\/b><br><br>Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in skin and bone of South American sea lions from Brazil and Uruguay were analysed to test the hypothesis that trophic overlap between the sexes is lower during the pre-breeding season than throughout the rest of the year. The isotopic values of skin and bone were used to infer the trophic relationships between the sexes during the pre-breeding period and year round, respectively. Prey species were also analysed to establish a baseline necessary for interpreting the stable isotope ratios of skin and bone. Standard ellipse areas, estimated using Bayesian inference in the SIBER routine of the SIAR package in R, suggested that males and females used a wide diversity of foraging strategies throughout the year and that no differences existed between the sexes. However, the diversity of foraging strategies was largely reduced during the pre-breeding period, with all the individuals of each sex adopting similar strategies, but with the two sexes differing considerably in stable isotope values and the ellipse areas of males and females not overlapping at all. Nevertheless, the results revealed a general increase in the consumption of pelagic prey by both sexes during the pre-breeding period. The progressive crowding of individuals in the areas surrounding the breeding rookeries during the pre-breeding period could lead to an increase in the local population density, which could explain the above reported changes. © Inter-Research 2015 · www.int-res.com.","<b>Ecological and geographical analysis of the distribution of the Mountain Tapir (Tapirus pinchaque) in Ecuador: Importance of protected areas in future scenarios of global warming<\/b><br><br>In Ecuador, Tapirus pinchaque is considered to be critically endangered. Although the species has been registered in several localities, its geographic distribution remains unclear, and the effects of climate change and current land uses on this species are largely unknown. We modeled the ecological niche of T. pinchaque using MaxEnt, in order to assess its potential adaptation to present and future climate change scenarios. We evaluated the effects of habitat loss due by current land use, the ecosystem availability and importance of Ecuadorian System of Protected Areas into the models. The model of environmental suitability estimated an extent of occurrence for species of 21,729 km2 in all of Ecuador, mainly occurring along the corridor of the eastern Ecuadorian Andes. A total of 10 Andean ecosystems encompassed ~98% of the area defined by the model, with herbaceous paramo, northeastern Andean montane evergreen forest and northeastern Andes upper montane evergreen forest being the most representative. When considering the effect of habitat loss, a significant reduction in model area (~17%) occurred, and the effect of climate change represented a net reduction up to 37.86%. However, the synergistic effect of both climate change and habitat loss, given current land use practices, could represent a greater risk in the short-term, leading to a net reduction of 19.90 to 44.65% in T. pinchaque's potential distribution. Even under such a scenarios, several Protected Areas harbor a portion (~36 to 48%) of the potential distribution defined by the models. However, the central and southern populations are highly threatened by habitat loss and climate change. Based on these results and due to the restricted home range of T. pinchaque, its preference for upland forests and paramos, and its small estimated population size in the Andes, we suggest to maintaining its current status as Critically Endangered in Ecuador. © 2015 Ortega-Andrade et al.","<b>Ecuador Paraiso Escondido Virus, a new flavivirus isolated from new world sand flies in Ecuador, Is the first representative of a novel clade in the genus Flavivirus<\/b><br><br>A new flavivirus, Ecuador Paraiso Escondido virus (EPEV), named after the village where it was discovered, was isolated from sand flies (Psathyromyia abonnenci, formerly Lutzomyia abonnenci) that are unique to the New World. This represents the first sand fly-borne flavivirus identified in the New World. EPEV exhibited a typical flavivirus genome organization. Nevertheless, the maximum pairwise amino acid sequence identity with currently recognized flaviviruses was 52.8%. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete coding sequence showed that EPEV represents a distinct clade which diverged from a lineage that was ancestral to the nonvectored flaviviruses Entebbe bat virus, Yokose virus, and Sokoluk virus and also the Aedes-associated mosquito-borne flaviviruses, which include yellow fever virus, Sepik virus, Saboya virus, and others. EPEV replicated in C6/36 mosquito cells, yielding high infectious titers, but failed to reproduce either in vertebrate cell lines (Vero, BHK, SW13, and XTC cells) or in suckling mouse brains. This surprising result, which appears to eliminate an association with vertebrate hosts in the life cycle of EPEV, is discussed in the context of the evolutionary origins of EPEV in the New World. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.","<b>A predictive model for human activity recognition by observing actions and context<\/b><br><br>This paper presents a novel model to estimate human activities — a human activity is defined by a set of human actions. The proposed approach is based on the usage of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Bayesian inference through the continuous monitoring of human actions and its surrounding environment. In the current work human activities are inferred considering not only visual analysis but also additional resources; external sources of information, such as context information, are incorporated to contribute to the activity estimation. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the way the information is encoded, so that it can be later associated according to a predefined semantic structure. Hence, a pattern representing a given activity can be defined by a set of actions, plus contextual information or other kind of information that could be relevant to describe the activity. Experimental results with real data are provided showing the validity of the proposed approach. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","<b>Competition influence in the segregation of the trophic niche of otariids: A case study using isotopic bayesian mixing models in Galapagos pinnipeds<\/b><br><br>RATIONALE The feeding success of predators is associated with the competition level for resources, and, thus, sympatric species are exposed to a potential trophic overlap. Isotopic Bayesian mixing models should provide a better understanding of the contribution of preys to the diet of predators and the feeding behavior of a species over time. METHODS The carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures from pup hair samples of 93 Galapagos sea lions and 48 Galapagos fur seals collected between 2003 and 2009 in different regions (east and west) of the archipelago were analyzed. A PDZ Europa ANCA-GSL elemental analyzer interfaced with a PDZ Europa 20-20 continuous flow gas source mass spectrometer was employed. Bayesian models, SIAR and SIBER, were used to estimate the contribution of prey to the diet of predators, the niche breadth, and the trophic overlap level between the populations. RESULTS Statistical differences in the isotopic values of both predators were observed over the time. The mixing model determined that Galapagos fur seals had a primarily teutophagous diet, whereas the Galapagos sea lions fed exclusively on fish in both regions of the archipelago. The SIBER analysis showed differences in the trophic niche between the two sea lion populations, with the western rookery of the Galapagos sea lion being the population with the largest trophic niche area. CONCLUSIONS A trophic niche partitioning between Galapagos fur seals and Galapagos sea lions in the west of the archipelago is suggested by our results. At intraspecific level, the western population of the Galapagos sea lion (ZwW) showed higher trophic breadth than the eastern population, a strategy adopted by the ZwW to decrease the interspecific competition levels in the western region.

This study was conducted (i) to establish the potential acute toxicity and the antinociceptive activity of some preparations of Cyrtopodium macrobulbon, in order to demonstrate its preclinical efficacy for treating symptoms of \"mal de orin\"; and (ii) to determine the chemical composition and quality control parameters of this medicinal orchid. Materials and methods The antinociceptive effect was assessed using the acetic acid-induced writhing and the hot-plate tests. Investigation of the acute toxicity was accomplished by the Lorke method. The organic extract (OE) was subjected to conventional phytochemical study using chromatographic conventional procedures. The volatile components profile of the species was accomplished via GC-MS analysis of HS-SPME-adsorbed compounds. Furthermore, an HPLC method to quantify ephemeranthol B (10) was developed and validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines. Microscopic anatomy studies were performed using light and scanning electron microscopies. Finally, a potential distribution map was generated using the MaxEnt modeling method. Results AE and OE were not toxic to mice since the LD50 was higher than 5000 mg/kg. OE was only active in the acetic acid-induced writhing assay at the doses of 100 and 316 mg/kg. Conventional phytochemical analysis of OE led to the isolation and characterization of n-hexacosyl-trans-p-coumarate (1), n-octacosyl-trans-p- coumarate (2), n-triacontyl-trans-p-coumarate (3), 4-methoxy-benzyl alcohol (4), 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (5), 1,5,7-trimethoxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene-2,6-diol (6), confusarin (7), gigantol (8), batatasin III (9), and ephemeranthol B (10). The major volatile components identified by HS-SPME analysis were 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone, eucalyptol (11), and isobornyl formate. An HPLC analytical method for the quantification of compound 10 in the plant was developed and fully validated for selectivity, accuracy, and precision. The microscopic studies revealed that the epidermal tissue displayed a layer of enlarged, crenate and cell thin-walled cells with a thickened cuticle; these cells are described for first time for this species. The potential distribution map generated revealed that this species is widespread in Mexico from Sinaloa to Merida states. Conclusions The results of the pharmacological studies tend to support the traditional use of Cyrtopodium macrobulbon for \"mal de orin\"; the presence of compounds 8, 9, and 11 with known antinociceptive activity might be related with the pharmacological effect demonstrated. The HPLC and microscopic analyses developed in this work will be valuable tools for quality control purposes for this plant. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","<b>Different meal, same flavor: Cospeciation and host switching of haemosporidian parasites in some non-passerine birds<\/b><br><br>Background: Previous studies have shown that haemosporidian parasites (Haemoproteus (Parahaemoproteus) and Plasmodium) infecting passerine birds have an evolutionary history of host switching with little cospeciation, in particular at low taxonomic levels (e.g., below the family level), which is suggested as the main speciation mechanism of this group of parasites. Recent studies have characterized diverse clades of haemosporidian parasites (H. (Haemoproteus) and H. (Parahaemoproteus)) infecting non-passerine birds (e.g., Columbiformes, Pelecaniiformes). Here, we explore the cospeciation history of H. (Haemoproteus) and H. (Parahaemoproteus) parasites with their non-passerine hosts. Methods. We sequenced the mtDNA cyt b gene of both haemosporidian parasites and their avian non-passerine hosts. We built Bayesian phylogenetic hypotheses and created concensus phylograms that were subsequently used to conduct cospeciation analyses. We used both a global cospeciation test, PACo, and an event-cost algorithm implemented in CoRe-PA. Results: The global test suggests that H. (Haemoproteus) and H. (Parahaemoproteus) parasites have a diversification history dominated by cospeciation events particularly at the family level. Host-parasite links from the PACo analysis show that host switching events are common within families (i.e., among genera and among species within genera), and occasionally across different orders (e.g., Columbiformes to Pelecaniiformes). Event-cost analyses show that haemosporidian coevolutionary history is dominated by host switching and some codivergence, but with duplication events also present. Genetic lineages unique to raptor species (e.g., FALC11) commonly switch between Falconiformes and Strigiformes. Conclusions: Our results corroborate previous findings that have detected a global cospeciation signal at the family taxonomic level, and they also support a history of frequent switching closer to the tips of the host phylogeny, which seems to be the main diversification mechanism of haemosporidians. Such dynamic host-parasite associations are relevant to the epidemiology of emerging diseases because low parasite host specificity is a prerequisite for the emergence of novel diseases. The evidence on host distributions suggests that haemosporidian parasites have the potential to rapidly develop novel host-associations. This pattern has also been recorded in fish-monogenean interactions, suggesting a general diversification mechanism for parasites when host choice is not restricted by ecological barriers. © 2014 Santiago-Alarcon et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","<b>Data driven modeling for monitoring and control of industrial fed-batch cultivations<\/b><br><br>A systematic methodology for development of a set of discrete-time sequence models for batch control based on historical and online operating data is presented and investigated experimentally. The modeling is based on the two independent characteristic time dimensions of batch processing, being time within the batch and the batch number. The model set is parsimoniously parametrized as a set of local, interdependent models which are estimated from data for as few as half a dozen batches. On the basis of state space models transformed from the acquired input-output model set, the asymptotic convergence of iterative learning control is combined with the closed-loop performance of model predictive control to form an optimal controller aiming to ensure reliable and reproducible operation of the batch process. This learning model predictive controller may also be used for optimizing control through optimization of the bioreactor operations model.

Bayesian and parsimony analyses of separate and combined datasets were largely congruent with each other and showed that the Neotropical Cyanaeorchis does not belongs in the predominantly Old World subtribe Eulophiinae, where it has previously been placed. Instead, it is strongly supported as a sister to Grobya in Catasetinae. Because Catasetinae are Neotropical and there are no unequivocal morphological similarities between Cyanaeorchis and other genera in the subtribe, this relationship reflects a geographical rather than morphological similarity and suggest habitat-driven local diversification. Specimens from central Brazil formerly identified as Cyanaeorchis minor are shown to be a distinct species, described here as C. praetermissa. Niche modeling indicates that C. praetermissa and C. minor have different distributions and ecological niches, whereas a third species, C. arundinae has broader climatic tolerances and a distribution that encompasses those of the other two species. The distribution of the genus is also predicted to include Bolivia, the states of Rio de Janeiro, Espirito Santo and several areas in northeastern Brazil, from where no collections are currently known. © 2014 Magnolia Press.","<b>Electrical energy conversion system design with single-phase inverter and H5 transformerless topology<\/b><br><br>This paper presents the design of an electrical energy conversion system (EECS) for the use of solar energy and its conditioning for injection of energy to the commercial power grid.

Our aim was to (1) test the multiple-colonization hypothesis against the single-colonization scenario proposed for most terrestrial organisms in the archipelago, (2) estimate the age of colonization of Phyllodactylus, and (3) evaluate the roles of dispersal and vicariance in the evolution of these lizards. Location: Galápagos archipelago, Ecuador. Methods: Phylogenetic relationships were evaluated with maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, including the estimation of divergence times and species trees. Previous biogeographical hypotheses were evaluated with tree-topology tests. Results: Our results support a multiple-colonization scenario: all but one species of Phyllodactylus in the Galápagos Islands belonged to a single radiation. The founders of this radiation colonized the archipelago 13.2 Ma when the islands currently above water had not yet emerged. Ten million years later, the ancestors of Phyllodactylus darwini colonized San Cristóbal. Main conclusions: As with other Galápagos organisms, the Pacific coast of South America seems to have been the source for the founders that led to the oldest radiation of leaf-toed geckos. Unlike most Galápagos endemics, however, P. darwini might have originated in the Andes. Our phylogenetic hypotheses and recent palaeogeographical data support both dispersal and vicariance as mechanisms leading to the radiation of leaf-toed geckos in the Galápagos Islands. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","<b>Integration of conflict into integrative taxonomy: Fitting hybridization in species delimitation of Mesocarabus (Coleoptera: Carabidae)<\/b><br><br>In species differentiation, characters may not diverge synchronously, and there are also processes that shuffle character states in lineages descendant from a common ancestor. Species are thus expected to show some degree of incongruence among characters; therefore, taxonomic delimitation can benefit from integrative approaches and objective strategies that account for character conflict. We illustrate the potential of exploiting conflict for species delimitation in a study case of ground beetles of the subgenus Carabus (Mesocarabus), where traditional taxonomy does not accurately delimit species. The molecular phylogenies of four mitochondrial and three nuclear genes, cladistic analysis of the aedeagus, ecological niche divergence and morphometry of pronotal shape in more than 500 specimens of Mesocarabus show that these characters are not fully congruent. For these data, a three-step operational strategy is proposed for species delimitation by (i) delineating candidate species based on the integration of incongruence among conclusive lines of evidence, (ii) corroborating candidate species with inconclusive lines of evidence and (iii) refining a final species proposal based on an integrated characterization of candidate species based on the evolutionary analysis of incongruence. This procedure provided a general understanding of the reticulate process of hybridization and introgression acting on Mesocarabus and generated the hypothesis of seven Mesocarabus species, including two putative hybrid lineages.

Projected changes in climate will likely exacerbate this situation. Using species distribution models, we assess possible future changes in the diversity and climatic niche size of an unprecedented number of species for the region. We modeled a broad range of taxa (11,012 species of birds and vascular plants), including both endemic and widespread species and provide a comprehensive estimation of climate change impacts on the Andes. We find that if no dispersal is assumed, by 2050s, more than 50% of the species studied are projected to undergo reductions of at least 45% in their climatic niche, whilst 10% of species could be extinct. Even assuming unlimited dispersal, most of the Andean endemics (comprising ~5% of our dataset) would become severely threatened (>50% climatic niche loss). While some areas appear to be climatically stable (e.g. Pichincha and Imbabura in Ecuador; and Nariño, Cauca, Valle del Cauca and Putumayo in Colombia) and hence depict little diversity loss and/or potential species gains, major negative impacts were also observed. Tropical high Andean grasslands (páramos and punas) and evergreen montane forests, two key ecosystems for the provision of environmental services in the region, are projected to experience negative changes in species richness and high rates of species turnover. Adapting to these impacts would require a landscape-network based approach to conservation, including protected areas, their buffer zones and corridors. A central aspect of such network is the implementation of an integrated landscape management approach based on sustainable management and restoration practices covering wider areas than currently contemplated. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.","<b>Prevalence of bovine tuberculosis in slaughtered cattle identified by nested-PCR in abattoirs from two dairy areas of Ecuador<\/b><br><br>Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic granulomatous disease that primarily affects lung tissue and lymph nodes (LN) in cattle, with economic impact on their productivity. Furthermore, it is potential zoonoses that may cause public health hazard. In this study, we evaluated the presence of bTB in two abattoirs: Cayambe and Pelileo countries located in the Ecuadorian provinces of Pichincha and Tungurahua, respectively. In total, 578 cattle were sampled (Cayambe 271 and Pelileo 307): 1,156 LN and 578 lung tissue samples were collected to apply in vitro culture and nested-PCR, respectively. The results determined a total apparent prevalence of 4.33 %, with 4.06 % at Cayambe's abattoir and 4.56 % at Pelileo's abattoir. Additionally, the Bayesian analysis showed a total true prevalence of 2.51 %, with 89.7 % of sensitivity and 97.6 % of specificity. The risk factors were evaluated by the use of simple logistic regressions with and without the random effect of places of origin. Associations of the origin of cattle in the selected slaughterhouses were found. The results showed an efficient method for the detection of bTB, which could identify a large number of infected animals, and the usefulness of lung tissue samples for early diagnosis of the disease was demonstrated in this study. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","<b>Population genetics of the Federally Threatened Miccosukee gooseberry (Ribes echinellum), an endemic North American species<\/b><br><br>Ribes echinellum (Coville) Rehder (Miccosukee gooseberry; Grossulariaceae) is a Federally Threatened species known from only two localities: Jefferson County (Florida, FL) and McCormick County (South Carolina, SC). This perennial shrub, ca. 1 m tall, is deciduous, and reproduces both vegetatively (clonal growth) and sexually (seed production). Recent surveys of the FL population revealed a dramatic decline in plant numbers. To assist in conservation and management of this species in FL and SC populations, microsatellite genetic markers were used to identify genotypes and assess the genetic structure of R. echinellum. We genotyped seven microsatellite loci in 102 individuals: 74 collected in FL and 28 in SC. Unbiased heterozygosity was between 0.28 and 0.53. All seven loci were polymorphic, showing a range of 1.52-2.13 effective number of alleles per locus (mean = 1.75). The two populations of R. echinellum show low genetic diversity, especially in SC. Clonality was not widespread, but was higher in the SC population. Both populations show signatures of bottlenecks but isolation by distance was not evident. We found significant deviation from HW equilibrium, with higher number of heterozygotes than expected. However when HW test was done for the combined populations as two separate groups, only FL showed a significant HW test and for SC the test was non-significant. Bayesian analysis and FST values suggest high genetic divergence between the populations. These results are important for developing a recovery plan and an ex situ and reintroduction conservation programs. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).","<b>Hybridization rate and climate change: Are endangered species at risk?<\/b><br><br>Many species are altering their geographic range due to climate change creating new sympatric populations of otherwise allopatric populations. We investigated whether climate change will affect the distribution and thus the pattern of hybridization between two pairs of closely related damselfly species [Ischnura damula and I. demorsa, and I. denticollis and I. gemina (this, an endangered species)]. Thus, we estimated the strength of pre and postmating reproductive barriers between both pairs of species, and we predicted future potential distribution under four different Global Circulation Models and a realistic emissions scenario of climate change by using maximum entropy modelling technique. Our results showed that reproductive isolation (RI) is complete in I. damula × I. demorsa individuals: F1 (first generation) hybrids are produced but do not reach sexual maturation. However, RI in I. denticollis × I. gemina hybrids is high but incomplete and unidirectional: only I. gemina females produced F1 hybrids which mate with males and females of I. denticollis and between them producing BC1 (backcrosses) and F2 (second generation) viable hybrids. Maximum entropy models revealed a northern and westward shift and a general reduction of the potential geographic ranges. Based on the pattern of hybridization, for I. damula and I. demorsa there is a current threat as well as a rapid displacement and/or extinction of I. gemina by I. denticollis. However, the current pattern of extinction may not continue due to the contraction in ranges of the four species. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","<b>Epidemiology of cutaneous leishmaniasis in central Amazonia: A comparison of sex-biased incidence among rural settlers and field biologists<\/b><br><br>Objective: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is more frequently reported in men than in women; this may be due to male-biased exposure to CL vectors, female-biased resistance against the disease or both. We sought to determine whether gender-specific exposure to vector habitats explains male-biased CL incidence in two human populations of central Amazonia. Methods: We compared the CL incidence in one population of field researchers (N = 166), with similar exposure for males and females, and one population of rural settlers (N = 646), where exposure is overall male-biased. We used a combination of questionnaires and clinical data to quantify CL cases, and modelled disease incidence in a Bayesian framework. Results: There was a moderately higher incidence of CL among men than among women in both populations, but male bias decreased as exposure time increased. Disease incidence was overall higher among field researchers, suggesting that they are an important but understudied CL risk group. Conclusion: Our comparison of two contrasting populations provided epidemiological evidence that CL incidence can be male-biased even when exposure is comparable in both sexes. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","<b>Maximizing species conservation in continental Ecuador: A case of systematic conservation planning for biodiverse regions<\/b><br><br>Ecuador has the largest number of species by area worldwide, but also a low representation of species within its protected areas. Here, we applied systematic conservation planning to identify potential areas for conservation in continental Ecuador, with the aim of increasing the representation of terrestrial species diversity in the protected area network. We selected 809 terrestrial species (amphibians, birds, mammals, and plants), for which distributions were estimated via species distribution models (SDMs), using Maxent. For each species we established conservation goals based on conservation priorities, and estimated new potential protected areas using Marxan conservation planning software. For each selected area, we determined their conservation priority and feasibility of establishment, two important aspects in the decision-making processes. We found that according to our conservation goals, the current protected area network contains large conservation gaps. Potential areas for conservation almost double the surface area of currently protected areas. Most of the newly proposed areas are located in the Coast, a region with large conservation gaps and irreversible changes in land use. The most feasible areas for conservation were found in the Amazon and Andes regions, which encompass more undisturbed habitats, and already harbor most of the current reserves. Our study allows defining a viable strategy for preserving Ecuador's biodiversity, by combining SDMs, GIS-based decision-support software, and priority and feasibility assessments of the selected areas. This approach is useful for complementing protected area networks in countries with great biodiversity, insufficient biological information, and limited resources for conservation. © 2014 The Authors.","<b>A comprehensive multilocus assessment of sparrow (Aves: Passerellidae) relationships<\/b><br><br>The New World sparrows (Emberizidae) are among the best known of songbird groups and have long-been recognized as one of the prominent components of the New World nine-primaried oscine assemblage. Despite receiving much attention from taxonomists over the years, and only recently using molecular methods, was a \"core\" sparrow clade established allowing the reconstruction of a phylogenetic hypothesis that includes the full sampling of sparrow species diversity. In this paper, we use mitochondrial DNA gene sequences from all 129 putative species of sparrow and four additional (nuclear) loci for a subset of these taxa to resolve both generic and species level relationships. Hypotheses derived from our mitochondrial (2184 base pairs) and nuclear (5705 base pairs) DNA data sets were generally in agreement with respect to clade constituency but differed somewhat with respect to among-clade relationships. Sparrow diversity is defined predominantly by eight well-supported clades that indicate a lack of monophyly for at least three currently recognized genera. Ammodramus is polyphyletic and requires the naming of two additional genera. Spizella is also polyphyletic with Tree Sparrow ( Spizella arborea) as a taxonomic \"outlier\". Pselliophorus is embedded within a larger Atlapetes assemblage and should be merged with that group. This new hypothesis of sparrow relationships will form the basis for future comparative analyses of variation within songbirds. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Novel data on the ecology of Cochranella mache (Anura: Centrolenidae) and the importance of protected areas for this critically endangered glassfrog in the Neotropics<\/b><br><br>We studied a population of the endangered glassfrog, Cochranella mache, at Bilsa Biological Station, northwestern Ecuador, from 2008 and 2009. We present information on annual abundance patterns, behavioral ecology, habitat use and a species distribution model performed with MaxEnt. We evaluate the importance of the National System of Protected Areas (SNAP) in Colombia and Ecuador, under scenarios of climate change and habitat loss. We predicted a restricted environmental suitability area from 48,509 Km2 to 65,147 Km2 along western Ecuador and adjacent Colombia; ��8% of the potential distribution occurs within SNAP. We examined four aspects of C. mache ecology: (1) ecological data suggests a strong correlation between relative abundance and rainfall, with a high probability to observe frogs through rainy months (February-May); (2) habitat use and the species distribution model suggest that this canopy dweller is restricted to small streams and rivulets in primary and old secondary forest in evergreen lowland and piedmont forest of western Ecuador, with predictions of suitability areas in adjacent southern Colombia; (3) the SNAP of Colombia and Ecuador harbor a minimum portion of the predicted model of distribution (,10%); and (4) synergetic effects of habitat loss and climate change reduces in about 95% the suitability areas for this endangered frog along its distributional range in Protected Areas. The resulting model allows the recognition of areas to undertake conservation efforts and plan future field surveys, as well as forecasting regions with high probability of C. mache occurrence in western Ecuador and southern Colombia. Further research is required to assess population tendencies, habitat fragmentation and target survey zones to accelerate the discovery of unknown populations in unexplored areas with high probability of suitability. We recommend that Cochranella mache must be re-categorized as \"Critically Endangered\" species in national and global status, according with criteria and sub-criteria A4, B1ab(i,ii,iii,iv),E.

It is known in three locations where it is sympatric with other Phaedranassa species. Phaedranassa viridiflora is the only species of the genus with yellow flowers. We analyzed 13 microsatellite loci to elucidate the genetic structure of the populations of P. viridiflora. Our results provided the first evidence of natural hybridization in the genus (between P. viridiflora and P. dubia in the Pululahua crater of northern Ecuador). The central and southern populations did not show hybridization. Genetic diversity was the highest in the Pululahua population. Central and southern populations have a higher proportion of clones than Pululahua. Bayesian and cluster analysis suggest that the yellow flower type evolved at least three times along the Ecuadorean Andes. In contrast to other Phaedranassa species, Phaedranassa viridiflora shows lower genetic diversity, which is likely related to a vegetative reproductive strategy. © 2013 The New York Botanical Garden (outside the USA).","<b>Wild populations of Triatoma infestans are highly connected to intra-peridomestic conspecific populations in the Bolivian Andes<\/b><br><br>Triatoma infestans, the major vector of Chagas disease south of the Amazon in South America, has a large distribution of wild populations, contrary to what has previously been stated. These populations have been suspected of being the source of reinfestation of human habitats and could impede the full success of vector control campaigns. This study examined gene flow between intra-peridomestic populations and wild populations collected in the surround areas in three Andean localities in Bolivia. The populations were defined according to temporal, ecological, and spatial criteria. After DNA extraction from the legs of each insect, the samples were analyzed using seven microsatellite markers. First, the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) detected an absence of differentiation between wild and intra-peridomestic populations, although strong structuring was observed between the populations within each environment. Then for some populations, the Bayesian method of assignment to inferred populations showed very similar assignment patterns of the members of wild or intra-peridomestic populations in each locality. Finally, the detection of the first-generation migrants within the different populations provided evidence of insect displacement from the wild to the intra-peridomestic environment. This result indicates that, after control campaigns in the Andes, controlling this new paradigm of vector transmission risk stemming from the invasion of human habitats by wild populations of T. infestans requires long-term maintenance of public monitoring to keep the risk at a minimal level. Since wild populations of T. infestans have also been detected elsewhere in Argentina, Paraguay, and Chile, there is an urgent need to take these populations into account in future monitoring of Chagas disease transmission. © 2013 Brenière et al.","<b>Bias in diet determination: Incorporating traditional methods in Bayesian mixing models<\/b><br><br>There are not \"universal methods\" to determine diet composition of predators. Most traditional methods are biased because of their reliance on differential digestibility and the recovery of hard items. By relying on assimilated food, stable isotope and Bayesian mixing models (SIMMs) resolve many biases of traditional methods. SIMMs can incorporate prior information (i.e. proportional diet composition) that may improve the precision in the estimated dietary composition. However few studies have assessed the performance of traditional methods and SIMMs with and without informative priors to study the predators' diets. Here we compare the diet compositions of the South American fur seal and sea lions obtained by scats analysis and by SIMMs-UP (uninformative priors) and assess whether informative priors (SIMMs-IP) from the scat analysis improved the estimated diet composition compared to SIMMs-UP. According to the SIMM-UP, while pelagic species dominated the fur seal's diet the sea lion's did not have a clear dominance of any prey. In contrast, SIMM-IP's diets compositions were dominated by the same preys as in scat analyses. When prior information influenced SIMMs' estimates, incorporating informative priors improved the precision in the estimated diet composition at the risk of inducing biases in the estimates. If preys isotopic data allow discriminating preys' contributions to diets, informative priors should lead to more precise but unbiased estimated diet composition. Just as estimates of diet composition obtained from traditional methods are critically interpreted because of their biases, care must be exercised when interpreting diet composition obtained by SIMMs-IP. The best approach to obtain a near-complete view of predators' diet composition should involve the simultaneous consideration of different sources of partial evidence (traditional methods, SIMM-UP and SIMM-IP) in the light of natural history of the predator species so as to reliably ascertain and weight the information yielded by each method. © 2013 Franco-Trecu et al.","<b>Nonintrusive, self-organizing, and probabilistic classification and identification of plugged-in electric loads<\/b><br><br>Electricity consumption for plugged-in electric loads (PELs) accounts for more use than any other single end-use service in residential and commercial buildings. PELs possess potentials to be efficiently managed for many purposes. However, few existing load identification methods are designed for PELs to handle challenges such as the diversity within each type of PELs and similarity between different types of PELs with similar front-end power supply units. Existing methods provide only absolute decisions which are not reliable when handling these challenges. This paper presents a simple yet efficient and practical hybrid supervised self-organizing map (SSOM)/Bayesian identifier for PELs. The proposed identifier can classify PELs into clusters by inherent similarities due to similar front-end power supply topologies, extract and utilize statistical information, and provide the probability of the unknown load belonging to a specific type of load.

However, and despite important advances, there is no consensus about the taxonomic status of phenotypically divergent T. dimidiata populations, which in most recent papers are regarded as subspecies.Methodology and Findings:A total of 126 cyt b sequences (621 bp long) were produced for specimens from across the species range. Forty-seven selected specimens representing the main cyt b clades observed (after a preliminary phylogenetic analysis) were also sequenced for an ND4 fragment (554 bp long) and concatenated with their respective cyt b sequences to produce a combined data set totalling 1175 bp/individual. Bayesian and Maximum-Likelihood phylogenetic analyses of both data sets (cyt b, and cyt b+ND4) disclosed four strongly divergent (all pairwise Kimura 2-parameter distances >0.08), monophyletic groups: Group I occurs from Southern Mexico through Central America into Colombia, with Ecuadorian specimens resembling Nicaraguan material; Group II includes samples from Western-Southwestern Mexico; Group III comprises specimens from the Yucatán peninsula; and Group IV consists of sylvatic samples from Belize. The closely-related, yet formally recognized species T. hegneri from the island of Cozumel falls within the divergence range of the T. dimidiata populations studied.Conclusions:We propose that Groups I-IV, as well as T. hegneri, should be regarded as separate species. In the Petén of Guatemala, representatives of Groups I, II, and III occur in sympatry; the absence of haplotypes with intermediate genetic distances, as shown by multimodal mismatch distribution plots, clearly indicates that reproductive barriers actively promote within-group cohesion. Some sylvatic specimens from Belize belong to a different species - likely the basal lineage of the T. dimidiata complex, originated ∼8.25 Mya. The evidence presented here strongly supports the proposition that T. dimidiata is a complex of five cryptic species (Groups I-IV plus T. hegneri) that play different roles as vectors of Chagas disease in the region. © 2013 Monteiro et al.","<b>Hepatozoon parasites (Apicomplexa: Adeleorina) in bats<\/b><br><br>We provide the first evidence of Hepatozoon parasites infecting bats.

These commercially important species occur in tropical and temperate coastal waters around the world. The taxonomy of the family has been revised a number of times in recent years, focusing in particular on genera such as Doryteuthis, Sepioteuthis, Alloteuthis, and Uroteuthis, which are represented by populations in the New World, Oceania, Europe/Africa, and Asia. However, no detailed phylogenetic analysis is available for the loliginids of the southern Atlantic, in particular the genus Doryteuthis. The present molecular study analyzed 81 loliginid taxa from around the world. The partial sequencing of the mitochondrial 16S and Cytochrome Oxidase I genes, and the nuclear rhodopsin gene revealed a number of important patterns, recovering the monophyletic status of the majority of the genera and revealing possible cryptic species in Doryteuthis plei D. pealei, Uroteuthis duvauceli and Sepioteuthis lessoniana. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Evolutionary history of Andean Pholidobolus and Macropholidus (Squamata: Gymnophthalmidae) lizards<\/b><br><br>Andean Pholidobolus and Macropholidus lizards contain seven and two species, respectively, as currently recognized.

Methods: We used maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches to reconstruct a three-gene phylogeny of Graphidaceae and a Bayesian molecular clock approach to estimate divergence dates for major clades, as well as Bayesian ancestral ecogeography state analysis.Key results: The new genus Redonographa represents a new subfamily, Redonographoideae, sister to subfamily Graphidoideae. Redonographa is exclusively saxicolous and restricted to the American Pacific coast from California to central Chile, including Galapagos. It contains four species: Redonographa chilensis comb. nov., R. saxiseda comb. nov., R. saxorum comb. nov., and R. galapagoensis sp. nov. The genus Gymnographopsis, with a similar ecogeography but differing in excipular carbonization and chemistry, is also included in Redonographoideae, with the species G. chilena from Chile and G. latispora from South Africa. Molecular clock analysis indicates that Redonographoideae diverged from Graphidoideae about 132 million years ago (Ma) in the Early Cretaceous.Conclusions: The divergence date for subfamilies Redonographoideae and Graphidoideae coincides with the early breakup of Gondwana and ancient origin of the Atacama Desert. However, the common ancestor of Redonographoideae plus Graphidoideae was reconstructed to be tropical-epiphytic. Thus, even if Redonographoideae is subtropical-saxicolous, the hypothesis that Graphidoideae evolved from a subtropical-saxicolous ancestor is not supported. © 2013 Botanical Society of America.","<b>Bayesian modelling to estimate the test characteristics of coprology, coproantigen ELISA and a novel real-time PCR for the diagnosis of taeniasis<\/b><br><br>Objective: To estimate and compare the performances of coprology, copro-Ag ELISA and real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (copro-PCR) for detection of Taenia solium tapeworm carriers. Methods: The three diagnostic tests were applied on 817 stool samples collected in two Zambian communities where taeniasis is endemic. A Bayesian approach was used to allow estimation of the test characteristics. Two (0.2%; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0-0.8), 67 (8.2%; 95% CI: 6.4-10.3) and 10 (1.2%; 95% CI: 0.5-2.2) samples were positive using coprology, copro-Ag ELISA and copro-PCR, respectively. Results: Specificities of 99.9%, 92.0% and 99.0% were determined for coprology, copro-Ag ELISA and copro-PCR, respectively. Sensitivities of 52.5%, 84.5% and 82.7% were determined for coprology, copro-Ag ELISA and copro-PCR, respectively. Conclusions: We urge for additional studies exploring possible cross-reactions of the copro-Ag ELISA and for the use of more sensitive tests, such as copro-PCR, for the detection of tapeworm carriers, which is a key factor in controlling the parasite in endemic areas. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","<b>Amazon diversification and cross-Andean dispersal of the widespread Neotropical tree species Jacaranda copaia (Bignoniaceae)<\/b><br><br>Aim: The phylogeographical history of Neotropical species can be difficult to reconstruct because of superimposed Neogene and Quaternary histories, and because of taxonomic uncertainty. We analysed range-wide genetic diversity in a widespread pioneer tree species, Jacaranda copaia (Aubl.) D. Don, to characterize phylogeographical structure, date the evolutionary relationships among lineages, and evaluate the role of dispersal and vicariance in establishing the present geographical range. Location: Guiana Shield; central, southern and western Amazon Basin; Chocó region; Central America. Methods: We analysed nine nuclear simple sequence repeat loci (nuSSR), eight chloroplast SSRs (cpSSR), and two cpDNA intergenic sequences in 341 adult trees. Genetic differentiation at nuSSRs was inferred using Bayesian clustering. Dating of chloroplast lineage divergence was obtained using a range of published mutation rates and Bayesian coalescence analyses. Population divergence dating was performed using an isolation-with-migration model for eight loci (one cp sequence and seven nuSSRs). Results: Nuclear SSR variation identified three geographically overlapping clusters (nu-1, nu-2, nu-3). Twelve cpDNA haplotypes were clustered into two haplogroups (cp-1, cp-2) with the central Amazon harbouring the highest diversity. Molecular dating analysis suggests that cpDNA haplotype diversification started around the end of the Pliocene (2.61 Ma on average), whereas population divergence was more recent and occurred during the mid-Quaternary (point estimates between 357 and 436 ka). Main conclusions: The genetic variation of J. copaia in the Neotropics was shaped mainly by Pleistocene events. Chloroplast diversity did not display the expected cis/trans Andean disjunction, indicating recent dispersal. Nuclear variation revealed that separate regions share a recent history, with a centre of diversity in the central Amazon Basin. The geographical pattern of diversity is congruent with the distribution of the two subspecies, J. copaia copaia and J. copaia spectabilis, and evidence of nuSSR admixture between the two taxa supports their classification as subspecies. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","<b>Phylogeography of a species complex of lowland Neotropical rain forest trees (Carapa, Meliaceae)<\/b><br><br>Aim Many tropical tree species have poorly delimited taxonomic boundaries and contain undescribed or cryptic species. We examined the genetic structure of a species complex in the tree genus Carapa in the Neotropics in order to evaluate age, geographic patterns of diversity and evolutionary relationships, and to quantify levels of introgression among currently recognized species. Location Lowland moist forests in the Guiana Shield, the Central and Western Amazon Basin, Chocó and Central America. Methods Genetic structure was analysed using seven nuclear simple sequence repeats (nuSSR), five chloroplast SSRs (cpSSR), and two chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) intergenic sequences (trnH-psbA and trnC-ycf6). Bayesian clustering analysis of the SSR data was used to infer population genetic structure and to assign 324 samples to their most likely genetic cluster. Bayesian coalescence analyses were performed on the two cpDNA markers to estimate evolutionary relationships and divergence times. Results Two genetic clusters (nu_guianensis and nu_surinamensis) were detected, which correspond to the Neotropical species C. guianensis (sensu latu) and C. surinamensis. Fourteen cpDNA haplotypes clustered into six haplogroups distributed between the two nuclear genetic clusters. Divergence between the haplogroups was initiated in the Miocene, with some haplotype structure evolving as recently as the Pleistocene. The absence of complete lineage sorting between the nuclear and chloroplast genomes and the presence of hybrid individuals suggest that interspecific reproductive barriers are incomplete. NuSSR diversity was highest in C. guianensis and, within C. guianensis, cpDNA diversity was highest in the Central and Western Amazon Basin. Regional genetic differentiation was strong but did not conform to an isolation-by-distance process or exhibit a phylogeographical signal. Main conclusions The biogeographical history of Neotropical Carapa appears to have been influenced by events that took place during the Neogene. Our results point to an Amazonian centre of origin and diversification of Neotropical Carapa, with subsequent migration to the Pacific coast of South America and Central America. Gene flow apparently occurs among species, and introgression events are supported by inconsistencies between chloroplast and nuclear lineage sorting. The absence of phylogeographical structure may be a result of the ineffectiveness of geographical barriers among populations and of reproductive isolation mechanisms among incipient and cryptic species in this species complex. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","<b>Cryptic species and phylogeographical structure in the tree Cedrela odorata L. throughout the Neotropics<\/b><br><br>Aim: The origins of much Neotropical biodiversity remain a topic of debate, with both palaeogeographical and more recent climatic drivers playing a role in diversification both among and within species. Here we use a combination of molecular data to assess genetic variation within and among species in the Neotropical tree genus Cedrela, with a focus on Cedrela odorata, to test hypotheses on the drivers of diversification, to place known ecotypic variation in context and to detect intraspecific phylogeographical structure. Location: Central and South America, Cuba, Cayman Islands, Trinidad and Guadeloupe. Methods: Samples were collected from the field, existing collections and herbaria from across the geographical range, including a total of 528 individuals from 72 sites. A phylogenetic framework was constructed using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence data (intergenic spacers plus flanking 18S and 26S regions), and genetic structure was analysed using a combination of chloroplast DNA sequences (trnC-ycf6, trnH-psbA) and chloroplast and nuclear microsatellite (single sequence repeat, SSR) loci. Phylogenetic reconstruction was undertaken using a combination of Bayesian and parsimony-based approaches; divergence times were estimated for major nodes. Geographical structure in chloroplast SSR data was analysed using SAMOVA, while that in nuclear SSR data was assessed using a combination of Bayesian clustering and principal coordinates analysis. Results: ITS sequence data supported phylogenetic distinctiveness of four morphologically cryptic species within C. odorata. Chloroplast sequence and microsatellite data showed geographical structuring both among and within species, suggesting the influence of climatic and geographical drivers. Intraspecific genetic divergence was also present in nuclear microsatellite data, suggesting contemporary gene flow limitation across sea and mountain barriers. Main conclusions: The data support diversification of the genus Cedrela in South America with subsequent recolonization into Central America prior to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. At least four morphologically cryptic taxa were evident within C. odorata and within-species phylogeographical divergence across the Andes and within Central America was present, the latter suggestive of Pleistocene climatic influence. Previously recognized ecotypes in Central America should be elevated to species level.

In this study, the phylogenetic relationships of the Neotropical members of the genus and selected groups of African Habenaria were investigated using DNA sequences from the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the plastid matK gene sampled from 151 taxa of Habenaria from the Neotropics (ca. 51% of the total) as well as 20 species of Habenaria and Bonatea from the Old World. Bayesian and parsimony trees were congruent with each other, and in all analyses, the Neotropical species formed a highly supported group. African species of Habenaria in sections Dolichostachyae, Podandria, Diphyllae, Ceratopetalae and Bilabrellae, and the Neotropical clade formed a highly supported \" core Habenaria clade\" , which includes the type species of the genus from the New World. The topology of the trees indicates an African origin for the Neotropical clade and the low sequence divergence among the Neotropical species suggests a recent radiation of the genus in the New World. Species of Bonatea and Habenaria sections Chlorinae and Multipartitae formed a well-supported clade that was sister to the \" core Habenaria clade\" The Neotropical clade consists of at least 21 well-supported subgroups, but all Neotropical sections of the current sectional classification are paraphyletic or polyphyletic and will need extensive revision and recircumscription. Most of the Neotropical subgroups formed morphologically uniform assemblage of species, but some cases of morphological divergence within subgroups and convergence between subgroups indicated that morphology alone can be misleading for inferring relationships within the genus. The genera Bertauxia, Kusibabella and Habenella, segregated from New World Habenaria, are not monophyletic and a revision of the sectional classification rather than a generic division seems most appropriate. Our results do not support an extensive generic fragmentation of Habenaria as previously suggested and will provide a framework for revising the infrageneric classification and investigating the patterns of morphological evolution and geographical distribution of the genus in the New World. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Comment on 'A qualitative approach to Bayes' theorem' by Medow and Lucey<\/b><br><br>empty","<b>Rhodnius barretti, a new species of triatominae (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) from western Amazonia<\/b><br><br>Rhodnius barretti, a new triatomine species, is described based on adult specimens collected in rainforest environments within the Napo ecoregion of western Amazonia (Colombia and Ecuador). R. barretti resembles Rhodnius robustus s.l., but mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences reveal that it is a strongly divergent member of the “robustus lineage”, i.e., basal to the clade encompassing Rhodnius nasutus, Rhodnius neglectus, Rhodnius prolixus and five members of the R. robustus species complex. Morphometric analyses also reveal consistent divergence from R. robustus s.l., including head and, as previously shown, wing shape and the length ratios of some anatomical structures. R. barretti occurs, often at high densities, in Attalea butyracea and Oenocarpus bataua palms. It is strikingly aggressive and adults may invade houses flying from peridomestic palms. R. barretti must therefore be regarded as a potential Trypanosoma cruzi vector in the Napo ecoregion, where Chagas disease is endemic. © 2013 Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

We review the influence of geological events such as the Pebas system, the Andean uplift and the land connections between South and Central/North America, on the historical assembly of Neotropical palms. We present a case study of the palm genus Astrocaryum (40 species) as a model for evaluating colonization and diversification patterns of lowland Neotropical taxa. We conducted a Bayesian dated phylogenetic analysis based on four low-copy nuclear DNA regions and a biogeographical analysis using the dispersal, extinction and cladogenesis model. Cladogenesis of Western Amazonian Astrocaryum spp. (c.6Mya) post-dated the drainage of the aquatic Pebas system, supporting the constraining role of Pebas on in situ diversification and colonization. The ancestral distribution of Astrocaryum spp. in the Guiana Shield supported the hypothesis of an old formation that acted as a source area from which species colonized adjacent regions, but an earliest branching position for Guianan species was not confidently recovered. A twofold increase in diversification rate was found in a clade, the ancestor of which occupied the Guiana Shield (c.13Mya, a time of climatic change and Andean uplift). © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.","<b>Modeling macroeconomic effects and expert judgments in operational risk: A Bayesian approach<\/b><br><br>In this paper we discuss operational risk modeling and consider a general Bayesian context incorporating information on market risk profile, expert opinion and operational losses, taking into account the general macroeconomic environment as well.

It generalizes under more realistic conditions a study realized by Lambrigger, Shevchenko and Wüthrich, and analyses the influence of macroeconomic effects on operational risk.

Factorial correspondence analysis, analysis of molecular variance, genetic distances, average number of migrants per population and Wright's F statistics were performed. Population structure was assessed by a Bayesian model, assuming an unknown number of K genetically distinct groups. The correspondence analysis showed that the populations of Guabalá and Guaymí cluster with Mexican creole cattle and Texas Longhorn. Lower genetic differentiation of Panamanian creole with Mexican and Texas Longhorn was also observed. The analyses of genetic distances have also shown similar results to those obtained by Amova and by the factorial correspondence analysis, and the less distance was observed between north populations and Panamanian ones, in comparison with southern populations. Bayesian clustering permitted the assignment of individuals to their respective groups, based on their genetic similarity, and provided information on the number of cluster from which they originate. There is a close historical, genetic, and geographic relationship of Panamanian, Mexican, and Texas Longhorn populations due to the migration of precursors from the Caribbean islands to Panama and Mexico.","<b>Gene flow networks among american aedes aegypti populations<\/b><br><br>The mosquito Aedes aegypti, the dengue virus vector, has spread throughout the tropics in historical times. While this suggests man-mediated dispersal, estimating contemporary connectivity among populations has remained elusive. Here, we use a large mtDNA dataset and a Bayesian coalescent framework to test a set of hypotheses about gene flow among American Ae. aegypti populations. We assessed gene flow patterns at the continental and subregional (Amazon basin) scales. For the Americas, our data favor a stepping-stone model in which gene flow is higher among adjacent populations but in which, at the same time, North American and southeastern Brazilian populations are directly connected, likely via sea trade. Within Amazonia, the model with highest support suggests extensive gene flow among major cities; Manaus, located at the center of the subregional transport network, emerges as a potentially important connecting hub. Our results suggest substantial connectivity across Ae. aegypti populations in the Americas. As long-distance active dispersal has not been observed in this species, our data support man-mediated dispersal as a major determinant of the genetic structure of American Ae. aegypti populations. The inferred topology of interpopulation connectivity can inform network models of Ae. aegypti and dengue spread. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","<b>Use of ring recoveries to predict habitat suitability in small passerines<\/b><br><br>Aim Abundance of small passerines may be distributed over large wintering areas according to geographical patterns that are difficult to detect. This may prevent the identification and conservation of the most suitable sectors, or the detection of local and regional features affecting the species during winter. In this paper, we explore the usefulness of ring recoveries to predict bird distribution in wintering grounds by using Maxent, one of the presence-only techniques available for modelling species distributions. We test whether suitability indices obtained in 2.5×2.5km UTM squares from ring recoveries were positively correlated with the actual abundance of robins (Erithacus rubecula) and blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) inside the squares. Location Spain. Methods We used 686 and 1139 localities across the country in which blackcap and robin ring recoveries were recorded by the Spanish Office of Migratory Species to generate the suitability maps. In addition, we sampled bird abundance inside 70 control squares independent of ring recovery localities along a belt crossing mountains, highlands and lowlands of the Iberian Peninsula during January from 2006 to 2011. Results Suitability indices predicted by Maxent were positively correlated with robin (r=0.42, n=70, P<0.001) and blackcap (r=0.52, n=70, P<0.001) abundances in the 70 control squares along the belt crossing the Iberian Peninsula. Main conclusions These results suggest that the use of distribution models with ring recoveries may be used to describe the habitat suitability of the winter ranges of small, common passerines. This also means that the huge number of ring recoveries stored in national and transnational data banks could be used to explore the factors shaping bird ranges and to forecast the geographical distribution of suitable wintering areas of migratory birds in large, poorly known regions. This may be useful in biogeography and conservation. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","<b>A spatio-temporal absorbing state model for disease and syndromic surveillance<\/b><br><br>Reliable surveillance models are an important tool in public health because they aid in mitigating disease outbreaks, identify where and when disease outbreaks occur, and predict future occurrences. Although many statistical models have been devised for surveillance purposes, none are able to simultaneously achieve the important practical goals of good sensitivity and specificity, proper use of covariate information, inclusion of spatio-temporal dynamics, and transparent support to decision-makers. In an effort to achieve these goals, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal conditional autoregressive hidden Markov model with an absorbing state.

Those predictions are evaluated subsequently using expert opinion. The established methodology of combining all SDMs is refined to assess species diversity within five defined vegetation types. Potential species diversity is thus predicted for each vegetation type respectively. The primary aim of the new methodology is to define, in more detail, areas of species richness for conservation planning. Methodology: Using Maxent, SDMs based on a suite of 14 environmental predictors were generated for 185 West Central African Leguminosae species, each categorised according to one of five vegetation types: Afromontane, coastal, non-flooded forest, open formations, or riverine forest. The relative contribution of each environmental variable was compared between different vegetation types using a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis followed by a post-hoc Kruskal-Wallis Paired Comparison contrast. Legume species diversity patterns were explored initially using the typical method of stacking all SDMs. Subsequently, five different ensemble models were generated by partitioning SDMs according to vegetation category. Ecological modelers worked with legume specialists to improve data integrity and integrate expert opinion in the interpretation of individual species models and potential species richness predictions for different vegetation types. Results/Conclusions: Of the 14 environmental predictors used, five showed no difference in their relative contribution to the different vegetation models. Of the nine discriminating variables, the majority were related to temperature variation. The set of variables that played a major role in the Afromontane species diversity model differed significantly from the sets of variables of greatest relative important in other vegetation categories. The traditional approach of stacking all SDMs indicated overall centers of diversity in the region but the maps indicating potential species richness by vegetation type offered more detailed information on which conservation efforts can be focused. © 2012 de la Estrella et al.","<b>Molecular phylogenetics of stream treefrogs of the Hyloscirtus larinopygion group (Anura: Hylidae), and description of two new species from Ecuador<\/b><br><br>We review the systematics of frogs of the Hyloscirtus larinopygion group. A new phylogenetic tree inferred from mitochondrial DNA (partial sequences of 12S rRNA, valine-tRNA, and 16S rRNA genes; ∼2.3 kb) of eleven species of the H. larinopygion group is provided, based on maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses. Our phylogeny confirms the close relationship of members of the H. larinopygion group with Andean relatives of the H. armatus group, which also occurs in the Andes. Hyloscirtus tapichalaca is placed as sister species to the rest of the H. larinopygion group, in which two clades (A+B) are evident. Although ingroup relationships are well supported, the monophyly of the H. larinopygion group and placement of H. tapichalaca require additional testing. Genetic divergences among species of the H. larinopygion group are shallow compared to those observed in many other anurans, with genetic distance among sister species (H. princecharlesi and H. ptychodactylus) as low as 1.31%. However, this pattern is concordant with radiations in other highland Andean lineages of anurans that show marked morphological or behavioral differentiation, but low divergence in mitochondrial markers. Divergence-time analyses (using BEAST) indicate that the Hyloscirtus clade is a relatively ancient lineage that appeared in the Eocene, at a minimum age of 51.2 million years ago (MYA), while the H. larinopygion group originated in the Middle-Late Eocene at a minimum age of 40.9 MYA. Our results might suggest a rapid radiation of Hyloscirtus starting in the Miocene into the Pliocene, from at least 14.2 MYA to the most recent divergence between sister taxa at ∼2.6 MYA. We also describe two sympatric new species of Hyloscirtus from northwestern Ecuador: H. criptico sp. nov. and H. princecharlesi sp. nov. We diagnose them by their phylogenetic position (they are not sister to each other), genetic divergence, and a unique combination of color patterns, and other morphological features. Additionally, we describe the suctorial tadpoles and the extreme ontogenic color changes in H. larinopygion, H. lindae, H. pantostictus, H. princecharlesi, H. psarolaimus, and H. tigrinus. Furthermore, we describe the osteology of H. criptico, H. lindae, H. pacha, H. pantostictus, H. princecharlesi, H. psarolaimus, H. ptychodactylus, and H. staufferorum. We describe vocalizations of H. lindae, H. pacha, H. pantostictus, H. pasarolaimus, H. staufferorum, and H. tapichalaca. Hyloscirtus tigrinus is recorded for the first time in Ecuador and its range is extended 62.4 km (airline distance), from its southernmost locality record in Departamento de Nariño, Colombia. Most species of the H. larinopygion group are currently severely threatened by extinction, after surviving the catastrophic extinctions in the 1980s and 1990s that led to the disappearance of many other sympatric anurans that bred in swiftly flowing water and had lotic water tadpoles in the Andean highlands. Research and conservation actions are urgently needed for these species. In order to better call attention to these conservation issues, we name one of the new species in honor of Prince Charles of Wa l e s, who is contributing significantly to the growth of awareness in the battle against tropical deforestation, climate change, and the catastrophic extinction of rainforest amphibians.

Phaedranassa tunguraguae is an IUCN endangered plant species endemic to a single valley in the Ecuadorian Andes. We estimate the levels of genetic differentiation across the geographic distribution of P. tunguraguae using 12 microsatellite loci. We discuss factors that might influence the genetic structure of this species. Genetic distance was used to evaluate relationship among populations and geographic patterns. Bayesian methods were used to investigate population structure, migration, evidence of recent bottlenecks, and time of divergence. The 7 populations form 2 genetic clusters. These clusters show highly significant differentiation between them, along with isolation by distance. Allele richness decreases from the most diverse westernmost population to the least diverse easternmost population. The species overall shows an excess of homozygotes, with highest levels of inbreeding in the easternmost population. We found evidence of recent bottleneck events. Migration rates were in general low but were higher between populations within each of the clusters. Time of divergence between populations was related to historical volcanic activity in the area. Based on our results, we propose 2 management units for P. tunguraguae. © The American Genetic Association. 2012.

Because Marmorkrebs are parthenogenetic, they could establish a population from only a single individual, and thus pose a risk for becoming established in Japan, as they have in other countries. There are two major reasons to be concerned about the possibility of Marmorkrebs establishing viable populations in Japan. First, Japan's only endemic crayfish, Cambaroides japonicus (De Haan, 1841), lives throughout Hokkaido and is endangered. Introduced Marmorkrebs are potential competitors that could further threaten C. japonicus. Second, Marmorkrebs live in rice paddies in Madagascar and consume rice. Marmorkrebs populations could reduce rice yields in Japan.Results: We created five models in MaxEnt of the potential distribution of Marmorkrebs in Japan. All models showed eastern Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu contain suitable habitats for Marmorkrebs. Hokkaido, the main habitat for C. japonicus, contained much less suitable habitat in most models, but is where the only Marmorkrebs in Japan to date was found.Conclusions: Marmorkrebs appear to be capable of establishing populations in Japan if introduced. They appear to pose minimal threat to C. japonicus, but may negatively affect rice production. © 2012 Faulkes et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","<b>Bayesian methodology for the analysis of spatial-temporal surveillance data<\/b><br><br>Early and accurate detection of outbreaks is one of the most important objectives of syndromic surveillance systems.

Location One of the highest mountain forest regions of the world, located in the Eastern Cordillera of the Ecuadorian Andes. Methods We compared genetic diversity and structure of adult trees with those of seedlings (n= 118 in both cases) in nine forest stands spanning an altitudinal gradient from 3500 to 4100m a.s.l. using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). Genetic diversity was calculated as percentage of polymorphic bands (P) and Nei's expected heterozygosity (He); genetic differentiation was assessed using analysis of molecular variance, Φ ST statistics and Bayesian cluster analysis. Results Estimates of genetic diversity at the population level were significantly lower in seedlings than in adults. Genetic diversity (He-value) was, in both cases, negatively correlated to altitude and positively correlated to population size in the seedlings. Genetic differentiation of the seedlings was approximately as high (φ ST= 0.298) as that of the adults (φ ST= 0.307), and geographical differentiation was clearly reflected in both AFLP profiles, with mountain ridges acting as barriers to gene flow. Main conclusions Our study provides evidence of a historic upslope migration of P. incana in central Ecuador. In addition, it highlights the detrimental effects of unexpectedly strong genetic isolation, both recent and historical, particularly for our wind-pollinated species where the distance between forest stands was less than 25km. We therefore additionally propose that in habitats with pronounced high-mountain landscape structures, gene flow may be hampered to such an extent that species have a more pronounced sensitivity to habitat fragmentation, even among populations of wind-pollinated trees. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","<b>Origin and population history of a recent colonizer, the yellow warbler in Galápagos and Cocos Islands<\/b><br><br>The faunas associated with oceanic islands provide exceptional examples with which to examine the dispersal abilities of different taxa and test the relative contribution of selective and neutral processes in evolution. We examine the patterns of recent differentiation and the relative roles of gene flow and selection in genetic and morphological variation in the yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia aureola) from the Galápagos and Cocos Islands. Our analyses suggest aureola diverged from Central American lineages colonizing the Galápagos and Cocos Islands recently, likely less than 300000years ago. Within the Galápagos, patterns of genetic variation in microsatellite and mitochondrial markers suggest early stages of diversification. No intra-island patterns of morphological variation were found, even across steep ecological gradients, suggesting that either (i) high levels of gene flow may be homogenizing the effects of selection, (ii) populations may not have had enough time to accumulate the differences in morphological traits, or (iii) yellow warblers show lower levels of 'evolvability' than some other Galápagos species. By examining genetic data and morphological variation, our results provide new insight into the microevolutionary processes driving the patterns of variation. © 2012 The Authors.

Our results indicate that this species is only distantly related to both Spiranthes and Cyclopogon, the genera in which it has been included by previous taxonomists. Instead it is recovered as sister to a clade formed by Eurystyles and Lankesterella, with strong support from the Bayesian analysis. The new, monotypic genus Quechua is proposed to accommodate former S. glabrescens, which differs from both Eurystyles and Lankesterella in habit as well as in vegetative and reproductive characters.

A previous molecular phylogenetic analysis based on plastid DNA supported the monophyly of Chloraeinae and Gavilea, but showed that Chloraea is non-monophyletic and that the sole species of Bipinnula analysed is sister to Geoblasta. However, that analysis included only 18 of the 73 species belonging to this subtribe. Here, the phylogenetic relationships of Chloraeinae were assessed by analysing aproximately 7500bp of nucleotide sequences from nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and plastid DNA (rbcL, matK, trnL-trnF, rpoB-trnC) for 42 species representing all four currently accepted genera of Chloraeinae and appropriate outgroups. Nuclear and plastid data were analysed separately and in combination using two different methods, namely parsimony and Bayesian inference. Our analyses support the monophyly of Chloraeinae and their inclusion in an expanded concept of Cranichideae, but none of the genera of Chloraeinae that includes more than one species is monophyletic. Gavilea and Bipinnula are paraphyletic, with Chloraea chica nested in Gavilea and Geoblasta penicillata in Bipinnula. As currently delimited, Chloraea is polyphyletic. The taxonomic changes proposed recently are for the most part not justifiable on phylogenetic grounds, except for recognition of the monotypic genus Correorchis. The lack of resolution for the relationships among species of 'core'Chloraea suggests a relatively recent diversification of this group. The current generic classification is in need or revision, but additional study is advisable before carrying out further taxonomic changes. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.","<b>An alignment-free approach for eukaryotic ITS2 annotation and phylogenetic inference<\/b><br><br>The ITS2 gene class shows a high sequence divergence among its members that have complicated its annotation and its use for reconstructing phylogenies at a higher taxonomical level (beyond species and genus). Several alignment strategies have been implemented to improve the ITS2 annotation quality and its use for phylogenetic inferences. Although, alignment based methods have been exploited to the top of its complexity to tackle both issues, no alignment-free approaches have been able to successfully address both topics. By contrast, the use of simple alignment-free classifiers, like the topological indices (TIs) containing information about the sequence and structure of ITS2, may reveal to be a useful approach for the gene prediction and for assessing the phylogenetic relationships of the ITS2 class in eukaryotes. Thus, we used the TI2BioP (Topological Indices to BioPolymers) methodology [1,2], freely available at http://ti2biop.sourceforge.net/ to calculate two different TIs. One class was derived from the ITS2 artificial 2D structures generated from DNA strings and the other from the secondary structure inferred from RNA folding algorithms. Two alignment-free models based on Artificial Neural Networks were developed for the ITS2 class prediction using the two classes of TIs referred above. Both models showed similar performances on the training and the test sets reaching values above 95% in the overall classification. Due to the importance of the ITS2 region for fungi identification, a novel ITS2 genomic sequence was isolated from Petrakia sp. This sequence and the test set were used to comparatively evaluate the conventional classification models based on multiple sequence alignments like Hidden Markov based approaches, revealing the success of our models to identify novel ITS2 members. The isolated sequence was assessed using traditional and alignment-free based techniques applied to phylogenetic inference to complement the taxonomy of the Petrakia sp. fungal isolate. © 2011 Agüero-Chapin et al.","<b>Field evaluation of urine antigen detection for diagnosis of Taenia solium cysticercosis<\/b><br><br>(Neuro)cysticercosis is an important zoonotic disease caused by infection with Taenia solium metacestode larvae. Existing immunodiagnostic techniques detect antibodies and circulating antigens (Ag) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Blood/CSF collection is an invasive procedure associated with blood-borne infections and is often not well accepted by communities. Detection of circulating Ag in urine has been suggested as an alternative, however this has been evaluated in clinical settings only. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the performance of a urine Ag-ELISA under field conditions. Paired serum and urine samples were obtained from participants in endemic areas of Ecuador (n= 748) and Zambia (n= 690) and were subjected to a monoclonal antibody-based Ag-ELISA. Calculation of positive and negative agreement indices (AI) showed better agreement in the negative direction both for Ecuadorian and Zambian samples (AI of 93.1 and 86.8, respectively). Using a Bayesian approach to determine the test characteristics, similar sensitivities were obtained for serum and urine Ag detection, whereas a decreased specificity was determined for the urine Ag-ELISA with a lower specificity (78.6%) for Zambian samples than for Ecuadorian samples (88.4%). This study indicates a higher specificity for the serum test under field conditions and promotes further research to improve the urine test. © 2011 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.","<b>Molecular phylogenetics, floral convergence and systematics of Dichromanthus and Stenorrhynchos (Orchidaceae: Spiranthinae)<\/b><br><br>Contrasting generic concepts of Dichromanthus and Stenorrhynchos held recently by taxonomists were assessed by means of parsimony and Bayesian cladistics analyses of 40 species/22 genera of Spiranthinae and over 2400 base pairs of non-coding nuclear and plastid DNA. Floral structure of relevant taxa was compared using fresh, pickled and herbarium specimens. Our results indicate that a broad concept of Dichromanthus corresponds to a strongly supported monophyletic group sharing several ecogeographical attributes and at least one putative floral synapomorphy (nectary formed by a narrow channel at the base of the labellum). Dichromanthus s.l. occupies a derived position within the Spiranthes clade, with Deiregyne being strongly supported as its sister genus. Stenorrhynchos, as delimited by most previous taxonomists, is shown to be polyphyletic; monophyly requires a narrower delimitation and this narrow concept is strongly supported as belonging in the Stenorrhynchos clade, which also includes members of the genera Eltroplectris, Mesadenella, Pteroglossa and Sacoila. The scant published information on natural pollination and inferences made from flower colouration and morphology suggest convergence in floral characteristics between species of Dichromanthus, Stenorrhynchos and probably other distantly related genera as a result of independent adaptation to pollination by hummingbirds. Bee-pollinated D. michuacanus is recovered in a derived position relative to hummingbird-pollinated Dichromanthus spp., suggesting a secondary reversal in this trait. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London.","<b>Conservation of Galápagos land iguanas: Genetic monitoring and predictions of a long-term program on the island of Santa Cruz<\/b><br><br>The distribution of the Galápagos land iguanas Conolophus subcristatus has been strongly affected by human activities in the last century. Previously widespread throughout the whole archipelago, today they inhabit only few islands, with populations often small and isolated. In this study, we analyzed the population genetic structure of land iguanas from Santa Cruz Island to investigate the genetic implications of a semi-captive conservation program that started in middle 1970s and is still ongoing. Nine microsatellites were used to measure the level of genetic variability and to detect potential evidence of inbreeding and genetic sub-structure. Furthermore, we used approximate Bayesian computation, together with software packages for coalescent-based simulations, to test a priori hypotheses in different demographic scenarios. Despite the abrupt reduction in size of the original population, no evidence of inbreeding was found, and the levels of genetic variability were similar to those of undisturbed populations of the archipelago. Nevertheless, the source and the repatriated populations started differentiating (FST=0.016) and genetic sub-structure was found. Following our results and the simulation of possible future scenarios, we suggest the genetic measures that should be adopted to avoid further genetic variability depletion and preserve this vulnerable endemic species. © 2011 The Authors.

Atelopus monophyly has been suggested but intergeneric, interspecific and intraspecific relationships are poorly understood. One reason is that morphological characters of harlequin frogs are often difficult to interpret, making species delimitations difficult. Molecular analyses (DNA barcoding, phylogeny) may be helpful but sampling is hampered as most of the more than 100 Atelopus species have undergone severe population declines and many are possibly extinct. We processed mitochondrial DNA (12S and 16S rRNA) of 28 available ingroup samples from a large portion of the genus' geographic range (Bayesian Inference, Maximum Likelihood). Our samples constitute a monophyletic unit, which is sister to other bufonid genera studied including the Andean genus Osornophryne. In contrast to previous morphological studies, our results suggest that Osornophryne is neither sister to Atelopus nor nested within it. Within Atelopus, we note two major clades with well supported subclades, one Amazonian-Guianan Clade (Flavescens-spumarius Clade plus Tricolor Clade) and an Andean-Chocó-Central American Clade (Varius Clade plus all other Atelopus). The first mentioned includes all species that possess a middle ear (i.e. stapes) except for A. seminiferus lacking it (like all remaining Atelopus). Previously proposed species groups based on frog-like versus toad-like overall appearance (i.e. Longirostris and Ignescens Groups) or phalangeal reduction in the thumb (i.e. Flavescens Group) are not monophyletic in our phylogeny, thus characters used to define them are not considered synapomorphies. We show that genetic divergence can be high between species belonging to different clades, in spite of their phenetic similarity (e.g. A. pulcher, Atelopus sp. 2). On the other hand, within the same clade, colour can vary tremendously, while genetic divergence is low (e.g. A. flavescens and allies). These observations demonstrate that Atelopus taxonomy is complicated and that an integrative approach is required before 'splitting' or 'lumping' nominal species. © 2011 The Natural History Museum.","<b>A comparative study of nonlinear machine learning for the \"in silico\" depiction of tyrosinase inhibitory activity from molecular structure<\/b><br><br>In the preset report, for the first time, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), Bayesian networks (BNs), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) are applied and compared on two \"in-house\" datasets to describe the tyrosinase inhibitory activity from the molecular structure. The data set Data I is used for the identification of tyrosinase inhibitors (TIs) including 701 active and 728 inactive compounds. Data II consists of active chemicals for potency estimation of TIs. The 2D TOMOCOMD-CARDD atom-based quadratic indices are used as molecular descriptors. The derived models show rather encouraging results with the areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AURC) curve in the test set above 0.943 and 0.846 for the Data I and Data II, respectively. Multiple comparison tests are carried out to compare the performance of the models and reveal the improvement of machine learning (ML) techniques with respect to statistical ones (see Chemometr. Intell. Lab. Syst. 2010, 104, 249). In some cases, these ameliorations are statistically significant. The tests also demostrate that k-NN, despite being a rather simple approach, presents the best behavior in both data. The obtained results suggest that the ML-based models could help to improve the virtual screening procedures and the confluence of these different techniques can increase the practicality of data mining procedures of chemical databases for the discovery of novel TIs as possible depigmenting agents.

Thus, the Topological Indices to BioPolymers (TI2BioP) methodology (Agüero-Chapin et al., 2010) inspired in both the TOPS-MODE and the MARCH-INSIDE methodologies allows the calculation of simple topological indices (TIs) as alignment-free classifiers. These indices were derived from the clustering of the amino acids into four classes of hydrophobicity and polarity revealing higher sequence-order information beyond the amino acid composition level. The predictability power of such TIs was evaluated for the first time on the RNase III family, due to the high diversity of its members (primary sequence and domain organization). Three non-linear models were developed for RNase III class prediction: Decision Tree Model (DTM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)-model and Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The first two are alignment-free approaches, using TIs as input predictors. Their performances were compared with a non-classical HMM, modified according to our amino acid clustering strategy. The alignment-free models showed similar performances on the training and the test sets reaching values above 90% in the overall classification. The non-classical HMM showed the highest rate in the classification with values above 95% in training and 100% in test. Although the higher accuracy of the HMM, the DTM showed simplicity for the RNase III classification with low computational cost. Such simplicity was evaluated in respect to HMM and ANN models for the functional annotation of a new bacterial RNase III class member, isolated and annotated by our group. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","<b>Focusing Conservation Efforts for the Critically Endangered Brown-headed Spider Monkey (Ateles fusciceps) Using Remote Sensing, Modeling, and Playback Survey Methods<\/b><br><br>Brown-headed spider monkeys (Ateles fusciceps), endemic to the Choco-Darien forests and lower Andean forests of NW Ecuador, are considered critically endangered. Unfortunately, scientific data regarding the actual status of populations is lacking. We combined satellite image analysis, species-specific habitat assessment, and a field survey technique using playback to focus conservation efforts for this species. First, we identified remaining forest via a LANDSAT mosaic and then applied species-specific criteria to delineate remaining forest with potential to hold populations. By combining this with the historical distribution from ecological niche modeling and predicted hunting intensity we generated a species-specific landscape map. Within our study area, forest capable of sustaining Ateles fusciceps covers 5872 km2, of which 2172 km2 (40%) is protected. Unprotected forest considered suitable for Ateles fusciceps extends to 3700 km2 but within this only 989 km2 (23%) is under low hunting pressure and likely to maintain healthy populations of Ateles fusciceps. To overcome problems of sampling at low primate density and in difficult mountain terrain we developed a field survey technique to determine presence and estimate abundance using acoustic sampling. For sites under low hunting pressure density of primates varied with altitude. Densities decreased from 7.49 individuals/km2 at 332 masl to 0.9 individuals/km2 at 1570 masl. Based on combining data sets in a gap analysis, we recommend conservation action focus on unprotected lowland forest to the south and west of the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve where hunting pressure is low and population densities of Ateles fusciceps are greatest. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","<b>Phylogeny and divergence times of Bactridinae (Arecaceae, Palmae) based on plastid and nuclear DNA sequences<\/b><br><br>Bactridinae include about 150 species of spiny Neotropical palms in five genera that are ecologically important in several vegetation types such as open woodland (Acrocomia), lowland rainforest (Astrocaryum, Bactris), and montane forest (Aiphanes). The subtribe also includes the only exclusively lianescent palm genus in the Neotropics (Desmoncus). We present a fully resolved molecular phylogeny of 41 species of Bactridinae, representing all genera as well as most of the currently accepted infrageneric taxa (subgenera, sections etc.) and recently proposed informal groups. Analyses are based on five plastid DNA regions (matK, trnQ-rps16, rps16 intron, trnD-trnT, trnL-trnF) and three nuclear markers (PRK, RPB2, ITS). A combined dataset was analysed with likelihood and parsimony methods. The results show that all accepted taxa at and above the generic level are monophyletic with high support. Astrocaryum alatum and A. mexicanum, recently segregated into a genus of their own (Hexopetion), form a strongly supported monophyletic group sister to the remaining Astrocaryum species. Desmoncus and Acrocomia are resolved as sister genera, and together they are sister to the remaining Bactridinae. This finding contrasts with that of two previous studies reporting Acrocomia to be sister to the rest of the subtribe. Aiphanes is resolved as sister to Bactris and Astrocaryum. Species-level relationships recovered within Astrocaryum and Bactris disagree to a large extent with previous morphology-based infrageneric classifications, suggesting that those characters are homoplasious, particularly within Bactris. A Bayesian dating analysis using the relaxed-clock model indicates that most genera of Bactridinae diverged during a relatively short period around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, which might explain the difficulties in resolving the phylogenetic backbone of the group. The mostly Andean genus Aiphanes shows an initial radiation of early lineages in the Oligocene (around 25 Ma ago) corresponding to an early uplift phase of the cordillera. These taxa are nowadays restricted to the mountain forests of Colombia and Ecuador. The main diversification of Andean Aiphanes began in the Miocene (around 11 Ma ago). This study provides the first substantial insight into Bactridinae phylogeny and sets the stage for more comprehensively sampled species-level studies analysing drivers of diversity of Neotropical palms, speciation patterns, character evolution, or biogeography.","<b>Change in the foraging strategy of female South American sea lions (Carnivora: Pinnipedia) after parturition<\/b><br><br>This study tests the hypothesis that female South American sea lions shift from off-shore, pelagic prey to coastal, benthic prey after parturition in order to reduce the foraging trip duration and hence the time pups remain unattended on the beach during early lactation. The δ13C and δ15N values of the serum and blood cells of 26 South American sea lion suckling pups from northern Patagonia were used to track the dietary changes of their mothers from late pregnancy to early lactation, after correction for differential isotopic fractionation between tissues. Primary producers and potential prey species were also analysed to establish a baseline for interpreting the stable isotope concentration of serum and blood cells. Isotopic ratios revealed a generalized increase in the consumption of coastal-benthic prey after parturition. Such a generalized post-partum shift will allow females to spend more time on land and look after their pups. The effects of this foraging strategy on the nutritional quality of the female's diet are discussed.","<b>Genetic differentiation in the nearly extinct harlequin frogs (Bufonidae: Atelopus), with emphasis on the Andean Atelopus ignescens and A. bomolochos species complexes<\/b><br><br>The evolutionary relationships of Andean harlequin frogs were studied, with emphasis on the Atelopus ignescens and A. bomolochos species complexes. Sampling included 53 individuals belonging to eight taxa and several unidentified species, for which a mitochondrial fragment (16S, tRNA-Leu, ND1, and tRNA-Ile; 1294 bp) was amplified. Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analyses were used to obtain hypotheses of relationships. The resulting phylogeny indicates that the species complexes are non-monophyletic. Additionally, analyses support the presence of four or five undescribed species. Most of these populations and newly discovered lineages have not been recorded in several years and are presumed extinct, the exception being two populations of probably new taxa from mid-elevations in southeastern Ecuador found during recent field surveys. Although sampling is limited, geographic isolation is the most plausible cause of differentiation among populations and taxa.

Serological tests are the most appropriate diagnostic tools to understand the transmission dynamics of the parasite, but the performances of these methods in such a setting are not known. A south Ecuadorian human population living in an endemic area was tested using three common serological tests. Because none of them is a gold standard, a Bayesian Latent Class analysis was used to estimate the test characteristics. Two definitions of a case were considered to differentiate between prevalence of current infection and prior exposure to the parasite. Differences between the performances of the same test in function of the definition of a case were observed. This study shows that test results and prior information should be interpreted carefully in a Bayesian analysis framework, particularly when the latter is based on clinical studies.

Uncovering how populations of a species differ genetically and ecologically is important for understanding evolutionary processes. Here we combine population genetic methods (microsatellites) with phylogenetic information (mtDNA) to define genetic population clusters of the wide-spread Neotropical tngara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus). We measure gene flow and migration within and between population clusters and compare genetic diversity between population clusters. By applying ecological niche modeling we determine whether the two most divergent genetic groups of the tngara frog (1) inhabit different habitats, and (2) are separated geographically by unsuitable habitat across a gap in the distribution. Results. Most population structure is captured by dividing all sample localities into two allopatric genetic lineages. The Northern genetic lineage (NW Costa Rica) is genetically homogenous while the Southern lineage (SW Costa Rica and Panama) is sub-divided into three population clusters by both microsatellite and mtDNA analyses. Gene flow is higher within the Northern lineage than within the Southern lineage, perhaps due to increased landscape heterogeneity in the South. Niche modeling reveals differences in suitable habitat between the Northern and Southern lineages: the Northern lineage inhabits dry/pine-oak forests, while the Southern lineage is confined to tropical moist forests. Both lineages seem to have had little movement across the distribution gap, which persisted during the last glacial maximum. The lack of movement was more pronounced for the Southern lineage than for the Northern lineage. Conclusions. This study confirms the finding of previous studies that tngara frogs diverged into two allopatric genetic lineages north and south of the gap in the distribution in central Costa Rica several million years ago. The allopatric distribution is attributed to unsuitable habitat and probably other unknown ecological factors present across the distribution gap. Niche conservatism possibly contributes to preventing movements across the gap and gene flow between both groups. Genetic and ecological data indicate that there is the potential for ecological divergence in allopatry between lineages. In this context we discuss whether the Northern and Southern lineages should be recognized as separate species, and we conclude that further studies of pre- and post-zygotic isolation are needed for a final assessment. Identified population clusters should motivate future behavioral and ecological research regarding within-species biodiversity and speciation mechanisms. © 2010 Pröhl et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","<b>Growth pattern of the sea urchin, Loxechinus albus (Molina, 1782) in southern Chile: Evaluation of growth models<\/b><br><br>The growth pattern of Loxechinus albus in southern Chile was studied using size-at-age data obtained by reading growth bands on the genital plates. The scatter plots of sizes-at-age for samples collected in three different locations indicated that growth is linear between ages 2 and 10. Five different growth models, including linear, asymptotic and non-asymptotic functions, were fitted to the data, and model selection was conducted based on the Akaike information criteria (AIC) and the Bayesian information criteria (BIC). The AIC identified the Tanaka model as the most suitable for two of the three sites. However, the BIC led to the selection of the linear model for all zones. Our results show that the growth pattern of L. albus is different from the predominantly asymptotic pattern that has been reported for other sea urchin species. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","<b>Molecular systematics and evolution of the Cyanocorax jays<\/b><br><br>Phylogenetic relationships were studied in the genus Cyanocorax (Aves: Corvidae) and related genera, Psilorhinus and Calocitta, a diverse group of New World jays distributed from the southern United States south to Argentina. Although the ecology and behavior of some species in the group have been studied extensively, lack of a molecular phylogeny has precluded rigorous interpretations in an evolutionary framework. Given the diverse combinations of plumage coloration, size, and morphology, the taxonomy of the group has been inconsistent and understanding of biogeographic patterns problematic. Moreover, plumage similarity between two geographically disjuct species, the Tufted jay (Cyanocorax dickeyi) from western Mexico and the White-tailed jay (C. mystacalis) from western Ecuador and Peru, has puzzled ornithologists for decades. Here, a phylogeny of all species in the three genera is presented, based on study of two mitochondrial and three nuclear genes. Phylogenetic trees revealed the non-monophyly of Cyanocorax, and the division of the whole assemblage in two groups: \"Clade A\" containing Psilorhinus morio, both species in Calocitta, Cyanocorax violaceus, C. caeruleus, C. cristatellus, and C. cyanomelas, and \"Clade B\" consisting of the remaining species in Cyanocorax. Relationships among species in Clade A were ambiguous and, in general, not well resolved. Within Clade B, analyses revealed the monophyly of the \"Cissilopha\" jays and showed no evidence for a sister relationship between C. mystacalis and C. dickeyi. The phylogenetic complexity of lineages in the group suggests several complications for the understanding biogeographic patterns, as well as for proposing a taxonomy that is consistent with morphological variation. Although multiple taxonomic arrangements are possible, recommendations are for recognizing only one genus, Cyanocorax, with Psilorhinus and Calocitta as synonyms. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.","<b>DNA from the past informs ex situ conservation for the future: An \"extinct\" species of Galápagos tortoise identified in captivity<\/b><br><br>Background: Although not unusual to find captive relicts of species lost in the wild, rarely are presumed extinct species rediscovered outside of their native range. A recent study detected living descendents of an extinct Galápagos tortoise species (Chelonoidis elephantopus) once endemic to Floreana Island on the neighboring island of Isabela. This finding adds to the growing cryptic diversity detected among these species in the wild. There also exists a large number of Galápagos tortoises in captivity of ambiguous origin. The recently accumulated population-level haplotypic and genotypic data now available for C. elephantopus add a critical reference population to the existing database of 11 extant species for investigating the origin of captive individuals of unknown ancestry. Methodology/Findings:We reanalyzed mitochondrial DNA control region haplotypes and microsatellite genotypes of 156 captive individuals using an expanded reference database that included all extant Galápagos tortoise species as well as the extinct species from Floreana. Nine individuals (six females and three males) exhibited strong signatures of Floreana ancestry and a high probability of assignment to C. elephantopus as detected by Bayesian assignment and clustering analyses of empirical and simulated data. One male with high assignment probability to C. elephantopus based on microsatellite genotypic data also possessed a \"Floreana-like\" mitochondrial DNA haplotype. Significance: Historical DNA analysis of museum specimens has provided critical spatial and temporal components to ecological, evolutionary, taxonomic and conservation-related research, but rarely has it informed ex situ species recovery efforts. Here, the availability of population-level genotypic data from the extinct C. elephantopus enabled the identification of nine Galápagos tortoise individuals of substantial conservation value that were previously misassigned to extant species of varying conservation status. As all captive individuals of C. elephantopus ancestry currently reside at a centralized breeding facility on Santa Cruz, these findings permit breeding efforts to commence in support of the reestablishment of this extinct species to its native range. © 2010 Russello et al.","<b>Progressive colonization and restricted gene flow shape island-dependent population structure in Galpagos marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus)<\/b><br><br>Background. Marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) inhabit the coastlines of large and small islands throughout the Galpagos archipelago, providing a rich system to study the spatial and temporal factors influencing the phylogeographic distribution and population structure of a species. Here, we analyze the microevolution of marine iguanas using the complete mitochondrial control region (CR) as well as 13 microsatellite loci representing more than 1200 individuals from 13 islands. Results. CR data show that marine iguanas occupy three general clades: one that is widely distributed across the northern archipelago, and likely spread from east to west by way of the South Equatorial current, a second that is found mostly on the older eastern and central islands, and a third that is limited to the younger northern and western islands. Generally, the CR haplotype distribution pattern supports the colonization of the archipelago from the older, eastern islands to the younger, western islands. However, there are also signatures of recurrent, historical gene flow between islands after population establishment. Bayesian cluster analysis of microsatellite genotypes indicates the existence of twenty distinct genetic clusters generally following a one-cluster-per-island pattern. However, two well-differentiated clusters were found on the easternmost island of San Cristábal, while nine distinct and highly intermixed clusters were found on youngest, westernmost islands of Isabela and Fernandina. High mtDNA and microsatellite genetic diversity were observed for populations on Isabela and Fernandina that may be the result of a recent population expansion and founder events from multiple sources. Conclusions. While a past genetic study based on pure FSTanalysis suggested that marine iguana populations display high levels of nuclear (but not mitochondrial) gene flow due to male-biased dispersal, the results of our sex-biased dispersal tests and the finding of strong genetic differentiation between islands do not support this view. Therefore, our study is a nice example of how recently developed analytical tools such as Bayesian clustering analysis and DNA sequence-based demographic analyses can overcome potential biases introduced by simply relying on F STestimates from markers with different inheritance patterns. © 2009 Steinfartz et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","<b>Phylogenetic systematics of lizards of the genus Stenocercus (Squamata: Iguania) from the northern Andes<\/b><br><br>The genus Stenocercus is composed of 61 species that occur mainly in the Andes and adjacent lowland areas (0-4 000 m) from northern Colombia and Venezuela to central Argentina. In this study, I performed parsimony and Bayesian analyses to infer the phylogenetic relationships among the 20 species of Stenocercus that occur in the northern Andes (Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela); I analyzed morphological, molecular, and combined datasets. These analyses resulted in similar topologies, which indicate that species of Stenocercus from the northern Andes are nested within 2 major clades. One of these clades contains 6 species occurring between southern Ecuador and southern Colombia, whereas the other clade includes 13 species that occur from southern Ecuador to northern Colombia and Venezuela. The results also suggest that the recent uplift of the northern Andes has had a major impact on the evolution of Stenocercus.","<b>High concentration of basidiolichens in a single family of agaricoid mushrooms (Basidiomycota: Agaricales: Hygrophoraceae)<\/b><br><br>The Agaricales is the largest and most diverse order of mushroom-forming Basidiomycota, with over 100 natural groups recognized in recent Fungal Tree of Life studies. Most agarics are either saprotrophic or ectomycorrhizal fungi, but the family Hygrophoraceae is in part characterized by a unique and remarkable diversity of lichenized forms. The most familiar of these is the chlorolichen genus Lichenomphalia, whose phylogenetic position in the Agaricales has been established. Recent limited evidence suggested that Hygrophoraceae also contains cyanolichens in the genus Dictyonema, which indicates a remarkable concentration and diversity of lichen-formers in a single family of agarics. To demonstrate the relationships of lichen-formers to other fungi in the family, we assembled ribosomal sequences from 52 species representing recognized groups within the Hygrophoraceae, among them new sequences representing Acantholichen and most species and forms of Dictyonema. The molecular data were evaluated using parsimony, likelihood, Bayesian, and distance analyses, including coding of ambiguous regions by means of INAASE and ARC, all of which indicate that Dictyonema and Acantholichen form a monophyletic clade derived from the primarily bryophilous genus Arrhenia and sister to the enigmatic Athelia pyriformis, a species unrelated to the Atheliales for which we are proposing a new genus name Eonema. The chlorolichen genus Lichenomphalia may be polyphyletic. Fungi in the Dictyonema-Acantholichen clade are typically tropical, entirely lichenized, and associate with cyanobacterial photobionts. Our data indicate a transition from agaricoid-omphalinoid basidiomes observed in Arrhenia to stereoid-corticioid forms in Dictyonema, and also support a previous suggestion of a connection between loss of clamp connections and lichenization. The diverse basidiome and thallus morphologies and nutritional ecologies of these fungi indicate a remarkable evolutionary flexibility that appears to have developed in part as a consequence of symbiosis. © 2009 The British Mycological Society.","<b>The phylogenetic position of the Galápagos Cormorant<\/b><br><br>The endangered Galápagos Cormorant, Phalacrocorax harrisi, is unique among the species of the Phalacrocoracidae in being flightless and sequentially polyandrous. It has had a vexed taxonomic history, variously being lumped with all the species in Phalacrocorax, being accorded its own genus, Nannopterum, or being included in Leucocarbo or Compsohalieus. Different authorities have similarly suggested a number of different species as being its closest relative. Here we use novel mitochondrial DNA sequence data to show that the Galápagos Cormorant is related to the sister pair of the mainland Americas, the Double-crested Cormorant, P. auritus, and the Neotropic Cormorant, P. brasilianus. This trio of species has high statistical support (Bayesian posterior probability of 1.00; NJ bootstrap 98%; MP bootstrap 91%). The Galápagos Cormorant is thus a relatively recent offshoot of the mainland form, which has subsequently evolved flightlessness. Until the phylogeny of the cormorants is more clearly resolved, we recommend the continued use of Phalacrocorax for all species. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Here we present the first detailed assessment of its distribution, ecology and conservation. We first used a maximum entropy model (Maxent model) to create a predicted distribution for this species based on very limited species occurrence data. We used this model to guide field surveys for the species between April and October 2006. We found a positive relationship between model values and species presence, indicating that the model was a useful tool to predict species occurrence and guide exploration. In the sites where the metaltail was found we gathered data on its habitat requirements, food resources and behaviour. Our results indicate that Violet-throated Metaltail is restricted to the Western Cordillera of the Andes Mountains in Azuay and Cañar provinces of Ecuador, with an area of extent of less than 2,000 km2. Deep river canyons to the north and south, lack of suitable habitat, and potential interspecific competition in the east may limit the bird's distribution. The species occurred in three distinct habitats, including Polylepis woodland, the upper edge of the montane forest, and in shrubby paramo, but we found no difference in relative abundance among these habitats. The metaltail seems to tolerate moderate human intervention in its habitats as long as some native brushy cover is maintained. We found that Brachyotum sp., Berberis sp., and Barnadesia sp. were important nectar resources. The 'Endangered' status of this species is supported due to its restricted distribution in fragmented habitats which are under increasing human pressures. © 2009 BirdLife International.","<b>Phylogenetic relationships of Cranichidinae and Prescottiinae (Orchidaceae, Cranichideae) inferred from plastid and nuclear DNA sequences<\/b><br><br>Background and AimsPhylogenetic relationships of subtribes Cranichidinae and Prescottiinae, two diverse groups of neotropical terrestrial orchids, are not satisfactorily understood. A previous molecular phylogenetic study supported monophyly for Cranichidinae, but Prescottiinae consisted of two clades not sister to one another. However, that analysis included only 11 species and eight genera of these subtribes. Here, plastid and nuclear DNA sequences are analysed for an enlarged sample of genera and species of Cranichidinae and Prescottiinae with the aim of clarifying their relationships, evaluating the phylogenetic position of the monospecific genera Exalaria, Ocampoa and Pseudocranichis and examining the value of various structural traits as taxonomic markers.MethodsApprox. 6000 bp of nucleotide sequences from nuclear ribosomal (ITS) and plastid DNA (rbcL, matK-trnK and trnL-trnF) were analysed with cladistic parsimony and Bayesian inference for 45 species/14 genera of Cranichidinae and Prescottiinae (plus suitable outgroups). The utility of flower orientation, thickenings of velamen cell walls, hamular viscidium and pseudolabellum to mark clades recovered by the molecular analysis was assessed by tracing these characters on the molecular trees.Key ResultsSpiranthinae, Cranichidinae, paraphyletic Prescottia (with Pseudocranichis embedded), and a group of mainly Andean 'prescottioid' genera (the 'Stenoptera clade') were strongly supported. Relationships among these clades were unresolved by parsimony but the Bayesian tree provided moderately strong support for the resolution (Spiranthinae-(Stenoptera clade-(Prescottia/Pseudocranichis- Cranichidinae))). Three of the four structural characters mark clades on the molecular trees, but the possession of a pseudolabellum is variable in the polyphyletic Ponthieva.ConclusionsNo evidence was found for monophyly of Prescottiinae and the reinstatement of Cranichidinae s.l. (including the genera of 'Prescottiinae') is favoured. Cranichidinae s.l. are diagnosed by non-resupinate flowers. Lack of support from parsimony for relationships among the major clades of core spiranthids is suggestive of a rapid morphological radiation or a slow rate of molecular evolution.","<b>Phylogenetic systematics of Glassfrogs (Amphibia: Centrolenidae) and their sister taxon Allophryne ruthveni<\/b><br><br>Based on a molecular phytogeny, a new phylogenetic taxonomy that is compatible with both the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) and the PhyloCode is proposed for Glassfrogs and their sister taxon, Allophryne ruthveni. The arrangement presented herein emphasizes the recognition of clades having (i) significant statistical support and congruence among phylogenetic estimation methods (i.e., parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference criteria), (ii) congruence among genetic markers, and (iii) morphological and/or behavioral distinctiveness. Also, when previously recognized groups are recovered as monophyletic or nearly monophyletic, we propose taxa that minimize the number of name changes required to make these groups monophyletic, preserving the names and contents of previous classifications (i.e., nomenclatural stability). The evolutionary proximity of Centrolenidae and Allophrynidae is recognized by combining these families into an unraked taxon, Allocentroleniae - a proposal that maintains the traditional names and species contents of Centrolenidae and Allophrynidae. We arrange centrolenid diversity in two subfamilies: Centroleninae and Hyalinobatrachinae. Within Centroleninae, the diagnosis and species content of the genera Centrolene, Cochranella, and Nymphargus are modified; Teratohyla is resurrected and modified, and Chimerella, Espadamna, Rulyrana, Sachatamia, and Vitreorana are proposed as new genera. The other subfamily, Hyalinobatrachinae, contains the new genus Celsiella and a modified Hyalinobatrachium that fully corresponds to the former fleischmanni Group. Additionally, the genus Ikakogi is described. Ikakogi could not be assigned with confidence to either subfamily and it is placed as incertae sedis in Centrolenidae. The data at hand suggest that Ikakogi tayrona is a lineage as old as the subfamilies Hyalinobatrachinae and Centroleninae. The revised taxonomy differs markedly from previous arrangements, which were based on phenetics and few morphological characters. Most of the genera defined herein are confined to distinct biogeographic regions, highlighting the importance of geography in the speciation of Glassfrogs. The principal limitation of this proposal is that it is based on an incomplete sampling of taxa (54% of the recognized Glassfrogs). Although diagnoses are based on phenotypic traits, there are several cases (16% of all species) in which the allocation of species is ambiguous because of morphological homoplasy and the lack of molecular data. Finally, in an attempt to facilitate species identification, comparison, and generic placement, we provide photographs for most (∼ 96%) of the recognized centrolenid species. © 2009 Magnolia Press.","<b>Genetic structure within and between island populations of the flightless cormorant (Phalacrocorax harrisi)<\/b><br><br>We assessed colony- and island-level genetic differentiation for the flightless cormorant (Phalacrocorax harrisi), an endangered Galápagos endemic that has one of the most limited geographical distributions of any seabird, consisting of only two adjacent islands. We screened 223 individuals from both islands and nine colonies at five microsatellite loci, recovering 23 alleles. We found highly significant genetic differentiation throughout the flightless cormorant's range on Fernandina and Isabela Islands (global F ST = 0.097; P < 0.0003) both between islands (supported by Bayesian analyses, FSTand RST values) and within islands (supported only by FST and RST values). An overall pattern of isolation-by-distance was evident throughout the sampled range (r = 0.4169, one-sided P ≤ 0.02) and partial Mantel tests of this relationship confirmed that ocean is a dispersal barrier (r = 0.500, one-sided P ≤ 0.003), especially across the 5-km gap between the two islands. The degree of detected genetic differentiation among colonies is surprising, given the flightless cormorant's limited range, and suggests a role for low vagility, behavioural philopatry, or both to limit dispersal where physical barriers are absent. We argue that this population should be managed as at least two genetic populations to better preserve the species-level genetic diversity, but, for demographic reasons, advocate the continued conservation of all breeding colonies. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","<b>Modeling gene sequence changes over time in type 3 dengue viruses from Ecuador<\/b><br><br>Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae.

Little is known about the evolutionary rates, viral spread and population dynamics of this genotype in the Latin American region. In order to gain insight into these matters, we used a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, to analyze envelope (E) gene sequences of the DENV-3 genotype III of strains included in a monophyletic cluster composed by Ecuadorian as well as strains from Cuba, Puerto Rico and Peru. The results of these studies revealed that the expansion population growth model was the best fit to the data. The most common recent ancestor (MRCA) was placed around 1989, in agreement with the first reports of the emergence of this new DENV-3 type. A mean rate 1.033 × 10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year was obtained. This rate is comparatively higher than the ones obtained for DENV-2 and DENV-4 in the same region. Faster population growth and greater population dispersal may have contributed to the vigorous initial transmission dynamics of this genotype in the Latin American region. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using a novel method of ancestral area reconstruction and relaxed Bayesian clock analyses, we reconstructed the biogeography of the poison frog clade (Dendrobatidae). We rejected an Amazonian center-of-origin in favor of a complex connectivity model expanding over the Neotropics. We inferred 14 dispersals into and 18 out of Amazonia to adjacent regions; the Andes were the major source of dispersals into Amazonia. We found three episodes of lineage dispersal with two interleaved periods of vicariant events between South and Central America. During the late Miocene, Amazonian, and Central American-Chocoan lineages significantly increased their diversity compared to the Andean and Guianan-Venezuelan- Brazilian Shield counterparts. Significant percentage of dendrobatid diversity in Amazonia and Chocó resulted from repeated immigrations, with radiations at <10.0 million years ago (MYA), rather than in situ diversification. In contrast, the Andes, Venezuelan Highlands, and Guiana Shield have undergone extended in situ diversification at near constant rate since the Oligocene. The effects of Miocene paleogeographic events on Neotropical diversification dynamics provided the framework under which Quaternary patterns of endemism evolved.","<b>Historical biogeography and speciation in the Neotropical highlands: Molecular phylogenetics of the jay genus Cyanolyca<\/b><br><br>Phylogenetic relationships were studied in the genus Cyanolyca, an assemblage of jays distributed from Mexico south to Bolivia. Given its fragmented distribution along the humid forests of the Neotropics, the genus Cyanolyca is a model group for exploring hypotheses on biogeography and speciation. Phylogenetic analyses were based on two mitochondrial and three nuclear loci; taxon sampling includes all species in the genus and most subspecies. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses produced trees that were congruent and highly robust at both terminal and deep nodes of the phylogeny. Cyanolyca comprises two major clades: one contains the Mesoamerican \"dwarf\" jays, and the other consists of two main groups-C. cucullata + C. pulchra and the \"core\" South American species. Prior hypotheses of relationships were explored statistically using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Dispersal-Vicariance analysis revealed the importance of the Northern Andes as a major center for biological diversification, and the effects of dispersal across the Panamanian Land Bridge in the composition of South American and Mesoamerican avifaunas. Phylogenetic patterns are highly congruent with an allopatric mode of speciation. Implications of these results are discussed in the context of the biogeography of Neotropical montane forests. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The genus Algansea is one of the most representative freshwater fish groups in central Mexico due to its wide geographic distribution and unusual level of endemicity. Despite the small number of species, this genus has had an unsettled taxonomic history due to high levels of intraspecific morphological variation. Moreover, several phylogenetic hypotheses among congeners have been proposed but have had the following shortcomings: the use of homoplasious morphological characters, the use of character codification and polarisation methods that lacked objectivity, and incomplete taxonomic sampling. In this study, a phylogenetic analysis among species of Algansea is presented. This analysis is based upon two molecular markers, the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b and the first intron of the ribosomal protein S7 gene. Results. Bayesian analysis based on a combined matrix (cytochrome b and first intron S7) showed that Algansea is a monophyletic group and that Agosia chrysogaster is the sister group. Divergence times dated the origin of the genus around 16.6 MYA, with subsequent cladogenetic events occurring between 6.4 and 2.8 MYA. When mapped onto the molecular phylogenetic hypothesis, the character states of three morphological characters did not support previous hypotheses on the evolution of morphological traits in the genus Algansea, whereas the character states of the remaining six characters partially corroborated those hypotheses. Conclusion. Monophyly of the genus Algansea was corroborated in this study. Tree topology shows the genus consists of three main lineages: Central-Eastern, Western, and Southern clades. However, the relationships among these clades remained unresolved. Congruence found between the available geological and climatic history and the divergence times made it possible to infer the biogeographical history of Algansea, which suggested that vicariance events were responsible for the evolutionary history of the genus. Interestingly, this pattern was shared with other members of the freshwater fish fauna of central Mexico. In addition, molecular data also show that some morphological traits alleged to represent synapomorphies in previous studies were actually homoplasies. Others traits were corroborated as synapomorphies, particularly in those species of a subgroup corresponding with the Central-Eastern clade within Algansea; this corroboration is interpreted as a result of evolutionary adaptations. © 2009 Pérez-Rodríguez et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","<b>Non-parametric bootstrapping of partitioned datasets<\/b><br><br>Non-parametric bootstrapping is one of the most commonly used methods for branch support assessment. Unlike Bayesian posterior probability values, which are influenced by a priori data partitioning, non-parametric bootstrapping is usually applied to unpartitioned (combined) datasets. The resulting bootstrap support values are misleading in that they do not measure how well clades are supported by all the partitions, unless all partitions are equal in size (i.e., number of characters). Since most empirical studies include data partitions that are heterogeneous in size, our current bootstrapping approach for partitioned datasets (i.e., bootstrapping the combined dataset) is not adequate. Here I propose a simple modification to non-parametric bootstrapping that takes a priori data partitioning into account by obtaining bootstrap replicates for each partition separately and combining them in such a way that the size (i.e., number of characters) of each partition is taken into account. With this \"corrected\" bootstrap support value, characters from smaller partitions will have greater influence on final bootstrap values, and those in larger partitions relatively less influence than they would for unpartitioned data.","<b>Population genetics of Galápagos land iguana (genus Conolophus) remnant populations<\/b><br><br>The Galápagos land iguanas (genus Conolophus) have faced significant anthropogenic disturbances since the 17th century, leading to severe reduction of some populations and the extinction of others. Conservation activities, including the repatriation of captive-bred animals to depleted areas, have been ongoing since the late 1970s, but genetic information has not been extensively incorporated. Here we use nine species-specific microsatellite loci of 703 land iguanas from the six islands where the species occur today to characterize the genetic diversity within, and the levels of genetic differentiation among, current populations as well as test previous hypotheses about accidental translocations associated with early conservation efforts. Our analyses indicate that (i) five populations of iguanas represent distinct conservation units (one of them being the recently discovered rosada form) and could warrant species status, (ii) some individuals from North Seymour previously assumed to be from the natural Baltra population appear related to both Isabela and Santa Cruz populations, and (iii) the five different management units exhibit considerably different levels of intrapopulation genetic diversity, with the Plaza Sur and Santa Fe populations particularly low. Although the initial captive breeding programmes, coupled with intensive efforts to eradicate introduced species, saved several land iguana populations from extinction, our molecular results provide objective data for improving continuing in situ species survival plans and population management for this spectacular and emblematic reptile. © 2008 The Authors.","<b>Bayesian clinical reasoning: Does intuitive estimation of likelihood ratios on an ordinal scale outperform estimation of sensitivities and specificities?<\/b><br><br>Rationale: Bedside use of Bayes' theorem for estimating probabilities of diseases is cumbersome. An alternative approach based on five categories of powers of tests from 'useless' to 'very strong' has been proposed. The performance of clinicians using it was assessed. Methods: Fifty clinicians attending a course of tropical medicine estimated powers of tests and post-test probabilities using the classical vs. the categorical Bayesian approach. The estimation of post-test probability was assessed for real and dummy diseases in order to avoid the bias of previous knowledge. Accuracy of answers was measured by the difference with reference values obtained from an expert system (Kabisa). Results: Clinicians estimated positive likelihood ratios (LRs) a median of -1.07 log10 lower than Kabisa [interquartile range (IQR): -1.47; -0.80] when derived classically and -0.17 (IQR: -0.42; +0.04) when estimated categorically (P < 0.001). For negative LRs the median was +0.39 log 10 higher (IQR: +0.71; +0.08) when derived classically and -0.18 log10 lower (IQR: +0.03; -0.36) when estimated categorically (P < 0.001). Twenty (40%) disclosed not being able to calculate post-test probabilities using sensitivities and specificities. Regardless the approach post-test probabilities were overestimated both for real and dummy diseases [respectively +1.23 log10 (IQR: +0,67; +2.08) and +2.03 log 10 (IQR: +0.49; +2.42)] (P = 0277), but the range was wider for the latter (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Participants were more accurate in estimating powers with a categorical approach than with sensitivities and specificities. Post-test probabilities were overestimated with both approaches. Knowledge of the disease did not influence the estimation of post-test probabilities. A categorical approach might be an interesting instructional tool, but the effect of training with this approach needs assessment. © 2008 The Authors.","<b>Geographic and genetic population differentiation of the Amazonian chocolate tree (Theobroma cacao L)<\/b><br><br>Numerous collecting expeditions of Theobroma cacao L. germplasm have been undertaken in Latin-America. However, most of this germplasm has not contributed to cacao improvement because its relationship to cultivated selections was poorly understood. Germplasm labeling errors have impeded breeding and confounded the interpretation of diversity anaylses. To improve the understanding of the origin, classification, and population differentiation within the species, 1241 accessions covering a large geographic sampling were genotyped with 106 microsatellite markers. After discarding mislabeled samples, 10 genetic clusters, as opposed to the two genetic groups traditionally recognized within T. cacao, were found by applying Bayesian statistics. This leads us to propose a new classification of the cacao germplasm that will enhance its management. The results also provide new insights into the diversification of Amazon species in general, with the pattern of differentiation of the populations studied supporting the palaeoarches hypothesis of species diversification. The origin of the traditional cacao cultivars is also enlightened in this study.","<b>Phylogenetic relationships of glassfrogs (Centrolenidae) based on mitochondrial and nuclear genes<\/b><br><br>Glassfrogs (family Centrolenidae) represent an exceptionally diverse group among Neotropical anurans, but their evolutionary relationships never have been assessed from a molecular perspective. Mitochondrial and nuclear markers were used to develop a novel hypothesis of centrolenid phylogeny. Ingroup sampling included 100 terminals, with 78 (53%) of the named species in the family, representing most of the phenotypic diversity described for the group. Thirty-five species representing taxa traditionally associated with glassfrogs were used as outgroups. Gene sampling consisted of complete or partial sequences of three mitochondrial (12S, 16S, ND1) and three nuclear markers (c-myc exon 2, RAG1, POMC) for a total of ∼4362 bp. Phylogenies were estimated using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses for individual genes and combined datasets. The separate analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear datasets allowed us to clarify the relationships within glassfrogs; also, we corroborate the sister-group relationship between Allophryne ruthveni and glassfrogs. The new phylogeny differs significantly from all previous morphology-based hypotheses of relationships, and shows that hypotheses based on few traits are likely to misrepresent evolutionary history. Traits previously hypothesized as unambiguous synapomorphies are shown to be homoplastic, and all genera in the current taxonomy (Centrolene, Cochranella, Hyalinobatrachium, Nymphargus) are found to be poly- or paraphyletic. The new topology implies a South American origin of glassfrogs and reveals allopatric speciation as the most important speciation mechanism. The phylogeny profoundly affects the traditional interpretations of glassfrog taxonomy, character evolution, and biogeography-topics that now require more extensive evaluation in future studies. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

An 800-bp mitochondrial DNA fragment, including a portion of COII, full tRNA-Lys, ATP8, and partial ATP6, was sequenced and analyzed for 96 individuals of the species and related taxa, resulting in a detailed framework of genetic differentiation in the northern half of the distribution of the complex. Phylogenetic analyses based on maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian optimality criteria found deep divergence between South American and Mesoamerican isolates, and seven differentiated populations corresponding to clear geographic breaks across the highlands of Mesoamerica. These distinct populations coincide with geographic structure found in previous analyses of morphological and molecular data for Chlorospingus ophthalmicus, as well as in previous phylogeographic studies of other taxa in the region. Species status for these populations is discussed under the evolutionary and biological species concepts. © 2008 The Authors.","<b>Molecular evolution of southern North American Cyprinidae (Actinopterygii), with the description of the new genus Tampichthys from central Mexico<\/b><br><br>Most of the recognized species of the genus Dionda inhabit drainages of the Gulf of Mexico from central Mexico to central Texas, USA, and have been considered a monophyletic group based on morphological, osteological, and allozyme investigations. Phylogenetic relationships of 15 species of Dionda and 34 species from closely related genera were inferred from one mitochondrial (cytb) and three nuclear gene sequences (S7, Rhodopsin, Rag1) totaling 4487 nucleotides. Separate analyses of all four genes yield congruent phylogenies; however the 15 putative species of Dionda evaluated were never recovered as a monophyletic group when species from nine related genera were included in the analyses. Among the ingroup taxa, one well-supported and highly divergent clade is consistently recognized and consists of six recognized and three undescribed northern species currently recognized in the genus Dionda. These nine species inhabit present or past tributaries of the Rio Grande basin of northern Mexico and southern USA, and were recovered as a basal clade in all analyses. Another large, also strongly supported clade, consisting of seven genera, include five southern recognized species currently in the genus Dionda, forming the sister group to the Codoma clade. These five species comprise the \"Southern Dionda clade\" and inhabit headwaters of the Pánuco-Tamesí drainage and some adjacent coastal rivers in the Tampico Embayment. The consistent and repeated identification of eight different clades recovered in most of the separate gene analyses strongly supports a division of the non-natural genus Dionda. A new genus, Tampichthys, is proposed for the clade of species endemic to east-central Mexico and formerly in Dionda. Tampichthys and the putative monotypic genus Codoma are more related to Mexican species of the genera Cyprinella and Notropis than to other species referred to Dionda sensu stricto. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Our analyses confirm the position of Lemna and its allies (formerly Lemnaceae) within Araceae as the well-supported sister group of all aroids except Gymnostachydoideae and Orontioideae. The last two subfamilies form the sister clade of the rest of the family. Monophyly of subfamilies Orontioideae, Pothoideae, Monsteroideae, and Lasioideae is supported, but Aroideae are paraphyletic if Calla is maintained in its own subfamily (Calloideae). Our results suggest expansion of the recently proposed subfamily Zamioculcadoideae (Zamioculcas, Gonatopus) to include Stylochaeton and identify problems in the current delimitation of tribes Anadendreae, Heteropsideae, and Monstereae (Monsteroideae), Caladieae/Zomicarpeae, and Colocasieae (Aroideae). Canalization of traits of the spathe and spadix considered typical of Araceae evolved after the split of Gymnostachydoideae, Orontioideae, and Lemnoideae. An association with aquatic habitats is a plesiomorphic attribute in Araceae, occurring in the helophytic Orontioideae and free-floating Lemnoideae, but evolving independently in various derived aroid lineages including free-floating Pistia (Aroideae).","<b>MMM-QSAR recognition of ribonucleases without alignment: Comparison with an HMM model and isolation from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, prediction, and experimental assay of a new sequence<\/b><br><br>The study of type III RNases constitutes an important area in molecular biology. It is known that the pac1+ gene encodes a particular RNase III that shares low amino acid similarity with other genes despite having a double-stranded ribonuclease activity. Bioinformatics memods based on sequence alignment may fail when there is a low amino acidic identity percentage between a query sequence and others with similar functions (remote homologues) or a similar sequence is not recorded in the database. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) applied to protein sequences may allow an alignment-independent prediction of protein function. These sequences of QS AR-like methods often use 1D sequence numerical parameters as the input to seek sequence-function relationships. However, previous 2D representation of sequences may uncover useful higher-order information. In the work described here we calculated for the first time the spectral moments of a Markov matrix (MMM) associated with a 2D-HP-map of a protein sequence. We used MMMs values to characterize numerically 81 sequences of type III RNases and 133 proteins of a control group. We subsequently developed one MMM-QSAR and one classic hidden Markov model (HMM) based on the same data. The MMM-QSAR showed a discrimination power of RNAses from other proteins of 97.35% without using alignment, which is a result as good as for the known HMM techniques. We also report for the first time the isolation of a new Pac1 protein (DQ647826) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe strain 428-4-1. The MMM-QSAR model predicts the new RNase III with the same accuracy as other classical alignment methods. Experimental assay of this protein confirms me predicted activity. The present results suggest that MMM-QSAR models may be used for protein function annotation avoiding sequence alignment with the same accuracy of classic HMM models. © 2008 American Chemical Society.","<b>Phylogenetic relationships of the cultivated neotropical palm Bactris gasipaes (Arecaceae) with its wild relatives inferred from chloroplast and nuclear DNA polymorphisms<\/b><br><br>Peach palm (Bactris gasipaes Kunth.) is the only Neotropical palm domesticated since pre-Columbian times. It plays an important role not only at the local level due to its very nutritious fruits, but also in the international market for its gourmet palm heart. Phylogenetic relationships of the peach palm with wild Bactris taxa are still in doubt, and have never been addressed using molecular sequence data. We generated a chloroplast DNA phylogeny using intergenic spacers from a sampling of cultivars of Bactris gasipaes as well as putative wild relatives and other members of the genus Bactris. We estimated phylogenetic relationships using maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian analysis. Our results indicated a close affinity between three taxa: Bactris gasipaes var. gasipaes, B. gasipaes var. chichagui, and B. riparia. There was no clear differentiation between these three taxa at the level of chloroplast sequences, and they shared a unique inversion that we characterized in this paper. Bactris setulosa, a species potentially related to the Bactris gasipaes complex, appeared highly divergent, and seemed to be a composite taxon with affinities outside the complex. We also investigated nuclear microsatellite polymorphisms at 8 loci within Bactris gasipaes, B. riparia, and B. setulosa, finding a pattern of relationships in agreement with the cpDNA data. The results presented here are important for future studies on domestication and crop improvement of Bactris gasipaes. © Copyright 2007 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.","<b>Bridging the gap between clinical practice and diagnostic clinical epidemiology: Pilot experiences with a didactic model based on a logarithmic scale<\/b><br><br>Rationale: From general practitioners to academic staff, clinicians continue to have difficulties in applying clinical epidemiology in their everyday work. They do not fully understand the logical rules behind the numbers and they do not recognize these rules in their work. We present a new model where the pre-test and the post-test probabilities are converted to log 10 of odds, and the likelihood ratio (LR) to its own log 10. Methods: Following Bayes' theorem, adding the log10LR to the log10 pre-test odds gives the log10 post-test odds, which can easily be represented on a logarithmic scale. In addition, by rounding the log10LR to half the unit, we create classes of discriminative power of tests, close to intuitive estimation. This model generates also a user-friendly diagram, adding considerably to the understanding of Bayes' theorem. We evaluated the effect of the rounding, the current use of the classical model and the acceptability of the new model. Results: Rounding 10 disease characteristics to half the unit gives an absolute error of less than half a unit. After six explanations of Bayes' theorem, only 6/16 medical students were capable of answering simple questions about predictive value. When asked about weight of disease characteristics, no one of the 50 clinicians mentioned sensitivity, specificity, predictive value or LR. With the new model, more than 80% of trainees found medical decision making easier to understand and recognized the theory in their practice. Conclusions: We conclude that our model of diagnostic clinical epidemiology offers a logical environment for an easy and rapid assessment of the evolution of disease probability with consecutive tests, providing a scientific format for 'qualitative' clinical estimations. © 2007 The Authors.","<b>Detection of individual specimens in populations using contour energies<\/b><br><br>In this paper we study how shape information encoded in contour energy components values can be used for detection of microscopic organisms in population images.

Phylogeographic inference, however, can be particularly challenging for recent dispersal events within islands, where the antagonistic effects of land bridge formation and vicariance can affect movements of organisms with limited dispersal ability. We investigated levels of genetic divergence and recovered signatures of dispersal events for 631 Galápagos giant tortoises across the volcanoes of Sierra Negra and Cerro Azul on the island of Isabela. These volcanoes are among the most recent formations in the Galápagos (<0.7 million years), and previous studies based on genetic and morphological data could not recover a consistent pattern of lineage sorting. We integrated nested clade analysis of mitochondrial DNA control region sequences, to infer historical patterns of colonization, and a novel Bayesian multilocus genotyping method for recovering evidence of recent migration across volcanoes using eleven microsatellite loci. These genetic studies illuminate taxonomic distinctions as well as provide guidance to possible repatriation programs aimed at countering the rapid population declines of these spectacular animals.

The species has been listed as critically endangered due to habitat deterioration and predation by introduced mammals. Significant morphological and behavioural differences among petrels nesting on different islands suggest that island populations may differ genetically. Furthermore, nesting phenology suggests that genetically differentiated seasonal populations may exist within at least one island. We analysed variation in six microsatellite loci and part of the mitochondrial ATPase 6/8 gene in 206 Galápagos petrels sampled from all five islands. No evidence of genetic structuring within islands was found, although statistical power was low. In contrast, significant differences occurred among island populations. For the microsatellite loci, private alleles occurred at all islands, sometimes at high frequency; global and pairwise estimates of genetic differentiation were all statistically significant; Bayesian analysis of genotypes frequencies provided strong support for three genetic populations; and most estimates of migration between populations did not differ significantly from zero. Only two ATPase haplotypes were found, but the geographic distribution of haplotypes indicated significant differentiation among populations. For conservation purposes, populations from Floreana, Santa Cruz, San Cristóbal and Santiago should be regarded as separate genetic management units. Birds from Isabela appear to be derived recently from the Santiago population, and the population on San Cristóbal appears to be a mixture of birds from other populations. However, considering ecological and behavioural differences among birds from different islands, we recommend that all five populations be protected. © Springer 2006.","<b>DNA typing from skeletal remains following an explosion in a military fort - First experience in Ecuador (South-America)<\/b><br><br>We present individual body identification efforts, to identify skeletal remains and relatives of missing persons of an explosion took place inside one of the munitions recesses of the Armoured Brigade of the Galapagos Armoured Cavalry, in the city of Riobamba, Ecuador, on Wednesday, November 20, 2002. Nineteen samples of bone remains and two tissue samples (a blood stain on a piece of fabric) from the zero zone were analysed. DNA extraction was made by Isoamilic Phenol-Chloroform-Alcohol, and proteinase K. We increased PCR cycles to identify DNA from bones to 35 cycles in some cases. An ABI 310 sequencer was used. Determination of the fragment size and the allelic designation of the different loci was carried out by comparison with the allelic ladders of the PowerPlex©16 kit and Gene Scan Analysis Software® programme. Five possible family groups were established and were compared with the profiles found. Classical Bayesian methods were used to calculate the Likelihood Ratio and it was possible to identify five different genetic profiles in our country.

The reasonable maximum errors, and in turn the uncertainties of the measured phase-difference values, depend mainly on the global effect of the optical noise and the environmental perturbations. Objectively, this effect can be characterized by repeatedly measuring the phase-difference; however, the phase-difference measuring process is not usually repeatedly performed. In this case, the scarcity of experimental data forces us to consider all the available information sources, objective and subjective, to estimate both the reasonable maximum error and the uncertainty. In this work, we evaluate the uncertainty associated with phase-difference values measured from fringe patterns generated by Moiré interferometry and by electronic speckle-pattern interferometry (ESPI); each measurement was performed only once using the conventional phase-shifting technique of four frames. Since the apparent lack of experimental information, we incorporated in the uncertainty evaluation procedure the estimations of experts on what the reasonable maximum error associated with each measurement should be. We argue that the incorporation of these estimations allowed us to consider the influence of some error sources that otherwise could be difficult to include explicitly. The used method for the uncertainty evaluation gives theoretical support to the expert intuition since it satisfies the formalities of the Bayesian statistic inference. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The pdf can be inferred from the dispersion of unbiased observations obtained by repeatedly measuring the quantity involved. If the quantity is not repeatedly measured, the apparent scarcity of experimental data may require consideration of information other than experimental data to assign the pdf and to evaluate the uncertainty; in this context, an evaluator tends intuitively to consider information linked with his experience. In this work, we report on a method, based on the theorem of Bayes, to assign the pdf and to evaluate the uncertainty of a quantity measured only once. This method allows us to include in the uncertainty evaluation the information concerning the evaluator's experience. It gives theoretical support to the intuition since it satisfies the formalities of statistical inference.

Seven of them were polymorphic, which led us to investigate several population-genetic parameters. Private alleles and significant differences in gene frequencies were found among the populations studied, which demonstrated the extent of genetic differentiation among the spectacled bear populations. The levels of gene diversity measured with these microsatellites were rather modest in this species. Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium was especially found for the overall and the Ecuadorian samples, and might be due to the Wahlund effect or consanguinity.

research on network reliability has considered links to have a binary state, i.e., functioning or failed, whereas nodes are considered flawless. In a more realistic scenario, both links and nodes might fail or may exhibit degradation behavior before failing. This study develops a framework to estimate the all-terminal reliability of a network that considers the degradation and probability of failure of all nodes and links in a network. Unlike previous works on network reliability that considered constant reliability for links, this paper considers the reliability of links, nodes, and the network as functions of time. In the proposed framework, the Bayesian methods (BM) are employed to estimate the reliability of links and nodes as functions of time considering degradation data. Due to the complexity of the all-terminal reliability problem, and to get fast estimations of the reliability of a network, an integration of Monte Carlo (MC) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is proposed. The proposed MC algorithm can estimate the network reliability for given nodes and links reliability values. To speed up the calculation, a DNN model is integrated into the framework, thus enabling accurate and fast estimation of network reliability for given link and node reliability values. The DNN accuracy, based on the RMSE (0.01460), outperforms previous traditional artificial neural network (ANN) approaches. Moreover, the DNN model takes 0.3 ms to compute the reliability for any given links and reliability values. The proposed framework can provide not only reliability point estimates but also credible intervals. Finally, we take advantage of Bayesian methods to integrate new data into the framework as they become available. The framework uses the new data to refine and further update the degradation model parameters and the prediction of the reliability of links, nodes, and the network. The proposed methodology has been demonstrated with the real-world network topology Ion (125 nodes, 150 links) with actual degradation data. © 2022","Introduction: This report proposes the application of a new Machine Learning algorithm called Fuzzy Unordered Rules Induction Algorithm (FURIA)-C in the classification of druglike compounds with antidiabetic inhibitory ability toward the main two pharmacological targets: α-amylase and α-glucosidase. Methods: The two obtained QSAR models were tested for classification capability, achieving satisfactory accuracy scores of 94.5% and 96.5%, respectively. Another important outcome was to achieve various α-amylase and α-glucosidase fuzzy rules with high Certainty Factor values. Fuzzyrules derived from the training series and active classification rules were interpreted. An important external validation step, comparing our method with those previously reported, was also included. Results: The Holm’s test comparison showed significant differences (p-value<0.05) between FURIA-C, Linear Discriminating Analysis (LDA), and Bayesian Networks, the former beating the two latter according to the relative ranking score of the Holm’s test. Conclusion: From these results, the FURIA-C algorithm could be used as a cutting-edge technique to predict (classify or screen) the α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of new compounds and hence speed up the discovery of new potent multi-target antidiabetic agents. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.","Helonoma peruviana is here reported as a generic and specific addition to the Ecuadorian orchid flora based on a plant found recently in the Cordillera del Cóndor. The systematic position of H. peruviana was assessed by means of a Bayesian inference analysis of plastid (matK-trnK, trnL-trnF) and nuclear (ITS) DNA sequences from 43 genera and 50 species of Spiranthinae, plus suitable outgroups. The analysis recovered H. peruviana as the strongly supported sister of Hapalorchis, being more distantly related to Beloglottis, a genus in which Helonoma has been merged at the sectional level. Despite some differences in perianth morphology, Helonoma and Hapalorchis share both vegetative (densely pubescent roots, decumbent rhizome) and reproductive traits (similar column and pollinarium morphology). Helonoma has a disjunct distribution between the Guiana Shield and the Andean tepui region, and H. peruviana is restricted to the later in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. © 2022 Magnolia Press.","Limited literature explores the relationship between economic impacts and pet ownership. Do people have more pets as a result of economic crises? In the current study, we answer this question by looking at the time series of pet ownership and children present in U.S. households from 2003 to 2018. We utilize a causal inference technique to compare the estimated real trend of pet ownership in American households against the scenario in which the 2007–2008 financial crisis would not have occurred. Our findings suggest that the financial crisis triggered households to own more pets, specifically dogs and cats. © 2022 by the authors.","Variability and climate change due to anthropic influence have brought about alterations to marine ecosystems, that, in turn, have affected the physiology and metabolism of ectotherm species, such as the common hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini). However, the impact that climate variability may have on this species’ distribution, particularly in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor, which is considered an area with great marine biodiversity, is unknown. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effect of derivate impact of climate change on the oceanographic distribution of the hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor, contrasting the present and future scenarios for 2050. The methodology used was an ecological niche model based on the KUENM R package software that uses the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt). The modelling was made for the year 2050 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios. A total of 952 models were made, out of which only one met the statistical parameters established as optimal, for future scenarios. The environmental suitability for S.lewini shows that this species would migrate to the south in the Chilean Pacific, associated with a possible warming that the equatorial zone will have and the possible cooling that the subtropical zone of the South Pacific will have by 2050, the product of changes in oceanographic dynamics. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","The Panamic Clingfish Gobiesox adustus is widely distributed in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP), from the central Gulf of California, Mexico to Ecuador, including the oceanic Revillagigedo Archipelago, and Isla del Coco. This cryptobenthic species is restricted to very shallow rocky-reef habitats. Here, we used one mitochondrial and three nuclear DNA markers from 155 individuals collected across the distribution range of the species in order to evaluate if geographically structured populations exist and to elucidate its evolutionary history. Phylogenetic analyses recovered a monophyletic group, with four well-supported, allopatric subgroups. Each subgroup corresponded to one of the following well-known biogeographic regions/provinces: 1) the Revillagigedo Archipelago, 2) the Cortez + Mexican provinces (Mexico), 3) the Panamic province (from El Salvador to Ecuador), and 4) Isla del Coco. A molecular-clock analysis showed a mean date for the divergence between clade I (the Revillagigedos and Cortez + Mexican provinces) and clade II (Panamic province and Isla del Coco) in the Pliocene, at ca. 5.33 Mya. Within clade I, the segregation between the Revillagigedos and Cortez + Mexican province populations was dated at ca. 1.18 Mya, during the Pleistocene. Within clade II, the segregation between samples of Isla del Coco and the Panamic province samples was dated at ca. 0.77 Mya, during the Pleistocene. The species tree, Bayesian species delimitation tests (BPP and STACEY), the ΦST, AMOVA, and the substantial genetic distances that exist between those four subgroups, indicate that they are independent evolutionary units. These cladogenetic events seem to be related to habitat discontinuities, and oceanographic and geological processes that produce barriers to gene flow for G. adustus, effects of which are enhanced by the intrinsic ecological characteristics of this species. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","A better understanding of long-term effects of climate and historical anthropogenic changes is needed to define effective conservation measures of endangered forest inhabiting managed landscapes. Diversification and distribution of Mediterranean firs are attributed to the global climate change during the Miocene and Quaternary as well as to the effects of human-driven deforestation. We evaluated the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities in shaping the genetic diversity and structure of Abies pinsapo Boiss. (Pinaceae), a relict fir endemic from SW Spain. We genotyped a total of 440 individuals from 44 populations by using two different molecular markers (cpSSRs and nSSRs). Overall, low genetic structure was found; however, incipient differentiation appeared within mountain ranges. Analyses suggest that the effects of isolation by distance and lithological or topographical diversity were not enough to structure the populations of the different mountain ranges. The combined role of genetic drift in the small populations and the anthropogenic action associated with forest management has shaped the current genetic pattern of this fir species in the study area. Demographic inference analyses pointed to a very recent synchronic divergence (eleventh–sixteenth century) of the ancestral A. pinsapo population into its current scattered distribution range. Although population bottlenecks were supported by several analyses, the conservation of this endangered species seems not to be limited by lacking genetic diversity, while threats of current climate change and habitat loss must be regarded. © 2022, The Author(s).","The structure of forest mammal communities appears surprisingly consistent across the continental tropics, presumably due to convergent evolution in similar environments. Whether such consistency extends to mammal occupancy, despite variation in species characteristics and context, remains unclear. Here we ask whether we can predict occupancy patterns and, if so, whether these relationships are consistent across biogeographic regions. Specifically, we assessed how mammal feeding guild, body mass and ecological specialization relate to occupancy in protected forests across the tropics. We used standardized camera-trap data (1002 camera-trap locations and 2-10 years of data) and a hierarchical Bayesian occupancy model. We found that occupancy varied by regions, and certain species characteristics explained much of this variation. Herbivores consistently had the highest occupancy. However, only in the Neotropics did we detect a significant effect of body mass on occupancy: large mammals had lowest occupancy. Importantly, habitat specialists generally had higher occupancy than generalists, though this was reversed in the Indo-Malayan sites. We conclude that habitat specialization is key for understanding variation in mammal occupancy across regions, and that habitat specialists often benefit more from protected areas, than do generalists. The contrasting examples seen in the Indo-Malayan region probably reflect distinct anthropogenic pressures. © 2022 The Authors.","Crime is a negative phenomenon that affects the daily life of the population and its devel-opment. When modeling crime data, assumptions on either the spatial or the temporal relationship between observations are necessary if any statistical analysis is to be performed. In this paper, we structure space–time dependency for count data by considering a stochastic difference equation for the intensity of the space–time process rather than placing structure on a latent space–time process, as Cox processes would do. We introduce a class of spatially correlated self-exciting spatio-temporal models for count data that capture both dependence due to self-excitation, as well as dependence in an underlying spatial process. We follow the principles in Clark and Dixon (2021) but considering a generalized additive structure on spatio-temporal varying covariates. A Bayesian framework is proposed for inference of model parameters. We analyze three distinct crime datasets in the city of Riobamba (Ecuador). Our model fits the data well and provides better predictions than other alternatives. © 2022 by the authors.

The directed acyclic graph of the Bayesian network is constructed from an attack graph that details the paths through which different attacks can occur in the IoT network. The parameters of the Bayesian network are estimated with the maximum likelihood method applied to a data set obtained from the simulation of attacks, in five simulation scenarios. For the risk assessment, inferences in the Bayesian network and the impact of the attacks are considered, focusing on DoS attacks, MitM attacks and both at the same time to the devices that allow the automation of the smart home and that are generally the ones that individually have lower levels of security. © 2022 by the authors.

The algorithm initially takes the ABC-SubSim algorithm structure and sequentially estimates the algorithm hyper-parameter by autonomous adaptation following a Markov chain approach, thus avoiding the error associated to modeler's choice for these hyper-parameters. The resulting algorithm, named (Formula presented.) BC-SubSim, simplifies the application of ABC-SubSim method for new users while ensuring better measure of accuracy in the posterior distribution and improved computational efficiency. A first numerical application example is provided for illustration purposes and to provide a comparative and sensitivity analysis of the algorithm with respect to initial ABC-SubSim algorithm. Moreover, the efficiency of the method is demonstrated in two nonlinear structural calibration case studies where the (Formula presented.) BC-SubSim is used as a tool to infer structural parameters with quantified uncertainty based on test data. The results confirm the suitability of the method to tackle with a real-life damage parameter inference and its superiority in relation to the original ABC-SubSim. © 2021 The Authors.

Three competing variables are considered in the bivariate setup along with GDP: the unemployment rate, the inflation rate, and gross domestic income. We find that the unemployment rate is the preferred variable to accompany GDP in the bivariate setup to obtain accurate estimates of its trend–cycle correlation coefficient and the cycle. We show that the key feature of the unemployment rate that allows for reliable estimates of the cycle of GDP is that its nonstationary component is small relative to its cyclical component. Using quarterly GDP and unemployment rate data from 1948:Q1 to 2019:Q1, we obtain a trend–cycle decomposition of GDP that resembles the conventional CBO estimates; we find positively correlated trend and cycle components. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","The Tropical Montane Cloud Forests (TMCF) of South America are ecosystems facing rapid changes due to global warming. Herein, we used species climatic niche models to reconstruct the climatic boundaries of TMCF and to predict range shifts in climate change scenarios. Thirty-two species from three taxonomic groups (plants, birds, and amphibians) were modelled using community-level niche models under current and future climatic scenarios, as determined by two Global Climate Models (GCMs) for the year 2050. The community-level reconstructions were used to detect the overlap of TMCF with surrounding ecosystems and with current protected areas (PA). Approximate 42–54% area reduction and 207–429 m upward elevational shift was predicted under climate scenarios. Accordingly, severe environmental contractions (loss of suitability area) due to climate change were detected by our models. TMCF area within PA may increase 17–38% by 2050. We identified transition zones rather than clear limits of vegetational boundaries of TMCF with adjacent ecosystems, which suggested that both TMCF and transitional zones will be impacted, to what conservation strategies targeting TMCF and adjacent ecosystems should be prioritized. © 2022 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação","This paper develops a macroeconomic uncertainty index based on the multistage procedure that combines maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation methods proposed by Jurado et al. (Am Econ Rev 105(3):1177–1216, 2015). Our approach streamlines the computation of the macroeconomic uncertainty index by specifying a state-space model estimated by maximum likelihood that allows us to obtain in one step the parameters of the model, the dynamic factors, and the forecast errors of the macroeconomic variables used to construct the index. Moreover, we estimate stochastic volatility models on the forecast errors also by maximum likelihood using a density filter that proves to be faster than a Bayesian estimation. After showing that our methodology produces reasonable results for the USA, we apply it to compute a macroeconomic uncertainty index for Ecuador, becoming the first index of this kind for a small developing or middle-income country. The results show that the Ecuadorian economy is more volatile and less predictable during recessions. We also provide evidence that macroeconomic uncertainty is detrimental to economic activity, finding that the responses of non-oil output, employment in the formal sector, and consumer prices to macroeconomic uncertainty shocks are sizable and persistent. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","This paper presents a proposal to implement a cluster method that best engages the educational data (socio-economic, academic achievement and dropouts) at the Engineering Faculty of Quevedo State Technical University. The use of graphical probabilistic models in the field of education has been proposed for this research. To complete the student diagnosis, and to predict their behavior as well, an analysis of such Bayesian networks learning models, as PC, K2, and EM optimization was made first. There should be a test for each case where the probability is measured in every model using propagation algorithms. Then, probability logarithm is applied to each case and the results are added in each model to determine the best fit for the proposed.

Using a realist approach of policy design, a causal mechanism linking transparency and public accountability is tested on the case of Chile´s environmental reforms, during the first Bachelet administration (2006–2010). Our hypothesis is that transparency improves public accountability through a causal mechanism made of two sets of formulation and calibration activities producing the causal entities responsible for the policy outcome. In order to empirically assess this causal mechanism, we treat policy instruments of information, regulation, treasure and organization as expected empirical observations along the process. We run five series of hoop tests on these instruments and use Bayes theorem of likelihood to update our confidence in the hypothesized mechanism. Our findings indicate that transparency institutionalization is shaped by a policy style combining a decentralized coordination mode with genuine collaborative governance. This has practical implications, not only for Chile´s on-going application to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) certification but also for any country interested in improving environmental governance in the extractive sector. © 2021","Daily banking practice suggests that there may be contagion effects between portfolios, a fact that has been explicitly recognized through current regulation. This paper describes a model that distinguishes between delinquency in each portfolio and allows inter-portfolio credit risk contagion, including macroeconomic and financial factors. Also, multivariate scenarios regarding portfolios’ credit risks were simulated. The private banking system of Ecuador was explored from January 2005 to December 2018. Delinquency among consumers, microcredit, and housing portfolios and their exogenous determinants were simultaneously quantified using a Bayesian vector autoregressive model. The results show that shocks in exogenous variables are often transmitted immediately in all portfolios. Simultaneously, the autoregressive terms take up to six months to affect these variables, but not cumulatively. A unit of shock in consumer delinquency causes an increase in microcredit delinquency immediately, and this effect is maintained until one month later, where it stabilizes and disappears at the tenth month. Furthermore, a unit of shock in microcredit delinquency produces an increase in consumer delinquency only in the medium term, after seven months. Including inter-portfolio linkages in credit, risk quantification allows to understand the micro-dynamics of absolute risk better and to evaluate the systemic importance of individual shocks since their impact spreads among portfolios with a domino effect. Further research in this area might focus on how to use these techniques as operational tools to incorporate financial stability considerations into control risk policy decision-making. © 2021 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland","Objectives: Evaluate the relevance of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive case detection policy or model implemented by the Ministry of Public Health (MPH) of Ecuador and to compare it with the experiences of other countries. Methods: Data contained the daily reports publicized by the MPH. The formulations were carried out under the Conditioned Probability modality applying Bayes' Theorem. All the COVID-19 tests applied in relation to the confirmed cases per million inhabitants were considered to obtain their level of positivity, and compared with the experience of Iceland and South Korea. Results: The probability of detecting positive cases of COVID-19 in Ecuador was higher than Iceland and South Korea, because the diagnostic tests were aimed at symptomatic patients, without identifying asymptomatic or mild symptomatic, who play an important role in the transmission of the disease. In addition, many symptomatic patients were examined but will remain undiagnosed due to the unavailability of tests and the low quality of many of them. Conclusions: The daily reports on the behavior of the COVID-19 issued by the Ecuadorian government do not adequately represent the growth in the number of those infected each day, nor the actual behavior of the epidemic, affecting possible control measures.

We studied the spatio-temporal diversification of a tree frog clade distributed throughout Amazonia (Anura: Hylidae: Osteocephalus, Tepuihyla, and Dryaderces) and tested the hypothesis that Miocene mega wetlands located in western and central Amazonia impacted connectivity among major biogeographic areas during extensive periods. We assessed the group’s diversity through DNA-based (16S rRNA) species delimitation to identify Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) from 557 individuals. We then selected one terminal for each OTU (n = 50) and assembled a mitogenomic matrix (~14,100 bp; complete for 17 terminals) to reconstruct a Bayesian, time-calibrated phylogeny encompassing nearly all described species. Ancestral area reconstruction indicates that each genus was restricted to one of the major Amazonian biogeographic areas (western Amazonia, Guiana Shield and Brazilian Shield, respectively) between ~10 and 20 Mya, suggesting that they diverged and diversified in isolation during this period around the Pebas mega wetland. After 10 Mya and the transition to the modern configuration of the Amazon River watershed, most speciation within each genus continued to occur within each area. In Osteocephalus, only three species expanded widely across Amazonia (< 6 Mya), and all were pond-breeders. Species with other breeding modes remained mostly restricted to narrow ranges. The spectacular radiation of Osteocephalus was probably driven by climatic stability, habitat diversity and the acquisition of new reproductive modes along the Andean foothills and western Amazonia. Our findings add evidence to the importance of major hydrological changes during the Miocene on biotic diversification in Amazonia. © 2022, The Author(s).","This document presents a proposal to implement a cluster method that best matches the educational data. The use of probabilistic graphic models in the field of education has been considered for this research. But the problem with these general learning procedures comes from the presence of a high number of variables that measure different aspects of the same concept. In this case, we have that all variables have some degree of dependence between them, without a true causal structure. Therefore, a new procedure is presented that makes a hierarchical grouping of the data while learning a joint probability distribution. We try to make a test for each case where the probability is measured in each model using propagation algorithms. Then, the probability logarithm is applied to each case and the results are added in each model to determine the best fit for the proposed one.

In 2017–18 we collected, from a farm located in the Ecuadorian province of Cotopaxi, 30 buds of the rose ‘Vendela’ that showed petal lesions similar to those caused by grey mould. For causal agent isolation and morphological characterization, the infected tissue was incubated on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Isolated fungal colonies grown on PDA showed grey-olive to dark green mycelium and conidia borne in chains with zero to three longitudinal septa and two to six transversal septa, indicating the presence of an Alternaria sp. A multilocus Bayesian inference phylogenetic analysis, including the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), RNA polymerase II (RPB2), and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1) gene regions, indicated that the isolates clustered with isolates of A. alternata. After pathogenicity analysis, A. alternata-inoculated rose petals showed similar symptoms to botrytis blight. To fulfill Koch’s postulates, the pathogen was re-isolated successfully. Here, we report that A. alternata is causing disease symptoms in rose buds/petals in Ecuador. © 2022 The Canadian Phytopathological Society.","Cough identification using DSP techniques in an audio signal is a complex task; thus, an artificial intelligence approach is proposed by applying machine learning, deep learning, and HMMs algorithms. Later, an ensemble learning model has been used to differentiate cough from other environmental sounds, putting those algorithms together and choosing the best result as the performance of the system. The final system consists of a preprocessing stage where the audio signals are adjusted through data augmentation, normalization, removal of silent fragments, and the transformation to Mel spectrograms, while, on back-end stage, three models have been evaluated: a convolutional neural network, a random forest, and a classifier based on hidden Markov models. We assembled a hard voting classifier (VC) model from the three models to obtain a more robust and reliable model. The VC model reached the highest precision and F1-score values without false-negative and up to 75% of true-positive values. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Nowadays, intelligent models can correctly detect faults by analysing signals from rotating machinery. However, most of the studies are run in controlled environments and the performance in industrial real-world environments is not yet fully validated. Hence, a suitable tool to implement fault diagnosers is transfer learning, this topic is under development and challenges persist. This paper proposes a framework for creating accurate 1D-CNN based fault classifiers that can be transferred between different rotating machines and working conditions. Multiple Bayesian processes select architecture parameters and hyperparameters, which minimize a loss function related to their transferability to other machines and to the same machine under different operating conditions (such as load and engine speed). The resulting model is fitted to heterogeneous fault diagnosis data resulting in a 1D-CNN ensemble that improves the performance of the unitary model. Subsequently, the transfer learning capability of the ensemble is analyzed on two source data sets using function and parameter based transfer. The results are compared with classical fault diagnosis classifiers. Finally, additional transfer operations on five target domain datasets validate our framework on limited labeled samples and allow interpretation of the ensemble results. The ultimate goal is to find an ensemble that can generalize fault diagnosis on rotating machinery for easy implementation and update in industrial settings. © 2013 IEEE.","The current study presents a design and implementation of a prediction model that prevents phishing attacks on emails using data mining techniques. Hereby, we collected appropriate data sets in order to identify the characteristics of the infected emails, which allow a phishing attack to be successful from three significant sources, being Monkey.org, Enron.org, and PhishTank.com. For the design and implementation of the model, we used the CRISP-DM methodology in order to generate the detection model based on the characteristics that recognize an email as phishing. Likewise, we developed a descriptive analysis using Decision Trees, Bayesian Networks, and Random Forest as data mining algorithms, whose most precise has been Random Forest. Once the email was detected as infected, the algorithm quarantines the email. Subsequently, it sends a notification message through WhatsApp. Finally, we evaluated the model in a controlled environment. The results demonstrate the functionality of the model since it achieved a precision score greater than 97.28% in the detection of phishing emails. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ethical hacking is modern data protection and prevention technique proper to prevent information losses. Under this precept, this study aims to design and implement an algorithm capable of circumventing preventive security to perpetuate an attack to steal information from the victim. The algorithm programmed through Python, MatLab, and R, automates the export of a data repository saved in a.CSV file, which contains all the methods to prevent an attack. In this way, when the algorithm is executed, it is trained to disable all detection mechanisms. The algorithm uses the structure of a neural network based on Deep Learning, Bayesian networks, a mathematical model, and a Rectified Linear Activation function or ReLU. It was configured to execute the algorithm on each interpreted output data. The proofs of concept were developed in a controlled virtual network environment, using a Linux-based server. The results were validated based on resource management in both processing and memory, using monitoring standards and averaging curves. Thus, we demonstrate the successful unauthorized access to a remote server to steal all the victim’s information and that the algorithm was undetectable and efficient. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cities have adopted the smart city model based on decision-making to maintain their sustainability and resilience.

Despite their ecological importance and sensitivity to disturbances, bryophytes are overlooked in conservation strategies due to knowledge gaps on their distribution, which is known as the Wallacean shortfall. Rare species deserve priority attention in conservation as they are at a high risk of extinction. This study aims to elaborate predictive models of rare bryophyte species in Canadian boreal forests using remote sensing-derived predictors in an Ensemble of Small Models (ESMs) framework. We hypothesize that high ESMs-based prediction accuracy can be achieved for rare bryophyte species despite their low number of occurrences. We also assess if there is a spatial correspondence between rare and overall bryophyte richness patterns. The study area is located in western Quebec and covers 72,292 km2. We selected 52 bryophyte species with [removed] 0.5) for 73% of the modeled species, with AUC values > 0.8 for 19 species, which confirmed our hypothesis. In fact, ESMs provided better predictions for the rarest bryophytes. Likewise, our study revealed a spatial concordance between rare and overall bryophyte richness patterns in different regions of the study area, which have important implications for conservation planning. This study demonstrates the potential of remote sensing for assessing and making predictions on inconspicuous and rare species across the landscape and lays the basis for the eventual inclusion of bryophytes into sustainable development planning.

Tomicodon petersii, a clingfish (Gobiesocidae) endemic to the TEP, is found on very shallow rocky reefs from central Mexico to northern Peru, and in the Cocos and Galapagos islands. We evaluated the effect of likely biogeographic barriers in different parts of the TEP on the diversification process of this species. We used one mitochondrial and three nuclear DNA markers from 112 individuals collected across the distribution range of T. petersii. Our phylogenetic results showed the samples constituted a monophyletic group, with three well-supported, allopatric subgroups: in the Mexican province, the Panamic province (from El Salvador to Ecuador), and the Galapagos Islands. The split between the Mexican and more southerly clades was estimated to occur at the end of the Miocene ca. 5.74 Mya, and the subsequent cladogenetic event separating the Galapagos population from the Panamic population at the junction of the Pliocene and Pleistocene, ca. 2.85 Mya. The species tree, Bayesian species delimitation tests (BPP), STACEY, and substantial genetic distances separating these three populations indicate that these three independent evolutionary units likely include two unnamed species. The cladogenetic events that promoted the formation of those genetically differentiated groups are consistent with disruptive effects on gene flow of habitat discontinuities and oceanographic processes along the mainland shoreline in the TEP and of ocean-island isolation, in conjunction with the species intrinsic life-history characteristics. © 2021","Coverage is an important factor for the effective transmission of data in the wireless sensor networks. Normally, the formation of coverage holes in the network deprives its performance and reduces the lifetime of the network. In this paper, a multi‐intelligent agent enabled reinforcement learning‐based coverage hole detection and recovery (MiA‐CODER) is proposed in order to overcome the existing challenges related to coverage of the network. Initially, the formation of coverage holes is prevented by optimizing the energy consumption in the network. This is performed by constructing the unequal Sierpinski cluster‐tree topology (USCT) and the cluster head is selected by implementing multi‐objective black widow optimization (MoBWo) to facilitate the effective transmission of data. Further, the energy consumption of the nodes is minimized by performing dynamic sleep scheduling in which Tsallis entropy enabled Bayesian probability (TE2BP) is implemented to switch the nodes between active and sleep mode. Then, the coverage hole detection and repair are carried out in which the detection of coverage holes if any, both inside the cluster and between the clusters, is completed by using the virtual sector‐based hole detection (ViSHD) protocol. Once the detection is over, the BS starts the hole repair process by using a multi-agent SARSA algorithm which selects the optimal mobile node and replaces it to cover the hole. By doing so, the coverage of the network is enhanced and better QoSensing is achieved. The proposed approach is simulated in NS 3.26 and evaluated in terms of coverage rate, number of dead nodes, average energy consumption and throughput. © 2021 by the authors.

We aimed to assess the origin, spatial patterns of genetic variation, and demographic history of the introduced populations in the contact zone of Central and Southeast Europe, using mitochondrial DNA control region sequences and microsatellite loci. Both types of molecular markers indicated relatively low to moderate levels of genetic variation. The mtDNA analyses revealed that common pheasants across the study area are divided into two distinct clades: B (mongolicus group) and F (colchicus group). Analyses of the microsatellite data consistently suggested a differentiation between Hungary and Serbia, with the pheasant population in Hungary being much more genetically homogeneous, while that of Serbia has much more genetic mixture and admixture. This cryptic differentiation was not detected using a non-spatial Bayesian clustering model. The analyses also provided strong evidence for a recent population expansion. This fundamental information is essential for adequate and effective conservation management of populations of a game species of great economic and ecological importance in the studied geographical region. © 2021, The Author(s).","This paper develops computational models to monitor patients with hip replacement surgery. The Kinect camera (Xbox One) is used to capture the movements of patients who are performing rehabilitation exercises with both lower limbs, specifically, 'side step' and 'knee lift' with each leg. The information is measured at 25 body points with their respective coordinates. Features selection algorithms are applied to the 75 attributes of the initial and final position vector of each rehab exercise. Different classification techniques have been tested and Bayesian networks, supervised classifier system and genetic algorithm with neural network have been selected and jointly applied to identify the correct and incorrect movements during the execution of the rehabilitation exercises. Besides, prediction models of the evolution of a patient are developed based on the average values of some motion related variables (opening leg angle, head movement, hip movement and execution speed). These models can help to fasten the recovery of these patients. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.

It has been proposed that occupation of new microhabitats may trigger selection for distinct phenotypic variants in these blood-sucking bugs. Although understanding phenotypic variation is key to the study of adaptive evolution and central to phenotype-based taxonomy, the drivers of phenotypic change and diversity in triatomines remain poorly understood. Methods/results: We combined a detailed phenotypic appraisal (including morphology and morphometrics) with mitochondrial cytb and nuclear ITS2 DNA sequence analyses to study Rhodnius ecuadoriensis populations from across the species’ range. We found three major, naked-eye phenotypic variants. Southern-Andean bugs primarily from vertebrate-nest microhabitats (Ecuador/Peru) are typical, light-colored, small bugs with short heads/wings. Northern-Andean bugs from wet-forest palms (Ecuador) are dark, large bugs with long heads/wings. Finally, northern-lowland bugs primarily from dry-forest palms (Ecuador) are light-colored and medium-sized. Wing and (size-free) head shapes are similar across Ecuadorian populations, regardless of habitat or phenotype, but distinct in Peruvian bugs. Bayesian phylogenetic and multispecies-coalescent DNA sequence analyses strongly suggest that Ecuadorian and Peruvian populations are two independently evolving lineages, with little within-lineage phylogeographic structuring or differentiation. Conclusions: We report sharp naked-eye phenotypic divergence of genetically similar Ecuadorian R. ecuadoriensis (nest-dwelling southern-Andean vs palm-dwelling northern bugs; and palm-dwelling Andean vs lowland), and sharp naked-eye phenotypic similarity of typical, yet genetically distinct, southern-Andean bugs primarily from vertebrate-nest (but not palm) microhabitats. This remarkable phenotypic diversity within a single nominal species likely stems from microhabitat adaptations possibly involving predator-driven selection (yielding substrate-matching camouflage coloration) and a shift from palm-crown to vertebrate-nest microhabitats (yielding smaller bodies and shorter and stouter heads). These findings shed new light on the origins of phenotypic diversity in triatomines, warn against excess reliance on phenotype-based triatomine-bug taxonomy, and confirm the Triatominae as an informative model system for the study of phenotypic change under ecological pressure[InlineMediaObject not available: see fulltext.]. © 2021, The Author(s).","Guava (Psidium guajava) is an aggressive invasive plant in the Galapagos Islands. Determining its provenance and genetic diversity could explain its adaptability and spread, and how this relates to past human activities. With this purpose, we analyzed 11 SSR markers in guava individuals from Isabela, Santa Cruz, San Cristobal, and Floreana islands in the Galapagos, as well as from mainland Ecuador. The mainland guava population appeared genetically differentiated from the Galapagos populations, with higher genetic diversity levels found in the former. We consistently found that the Central Highlands region of mainland Ecuador is one of the most likely origins of the Galapagos populations. Moreover, the guavas from Isabela and Floreana show a potential genetic input from southern mainland Ecuador, while the population from San Cristobal would be linked to the coastal mainland regions. Interestingly, the proposed origins for the Galapagos guava coincide with the first human settlings of the archipelago. Through approximate Bayesian computation, we propose a model where San Cristobal was the first island to be colonized by guava from the mainland, and then, it would have spread to Floreana and finally to Santa Cruz; Isabela would have been seeded from Floreana. An independent trajectory could also have contributed to the invasion of Floreana and Isabela. The pathway shown in our model agrees with the human colonization history of the different islands in the Galapagos. Our model, in conjunction with the clustering patterns of the individuals (based on genetic distances), suggests that guava introduction history in the Galapagos archipelago was driven by either a single event or a series of introduction events in rapid succession. We thus show that genetic analyses supported by historical sources can be used to track the arrival and spread of invasive species in novel habitats and the potential role of human activities in such processes. © 2021 The Authors.

Consequently, heavy metal(loid)s are easily released into the environment, being a potential risk to human health. This study carries out a Bayesian probabilistic human health risk assessment, related to multi-pathway exposure to heavy metal(loid)s in a gold mining area in Southern Ecuador. Concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in tap water, surface water, and soil samples, were analyzed to assess the potential adverse human health effects based on the Hazard Index (HI) and Total cancer risk (TCR). Adults and children residents were surveyed to adjust their exposure parameters to the site-specific conditions. Exposure to heavy metal(loid)s resulted in unacceptable risk levels for human health in the two age groups, both carcinogenic (TCR > 1 × 10−5) and non-carcinogenic (HI > 1) through ingestion of tap water and incidental ingestion of surface water. Sensitivity analysis showed that As concentration in waters and exposure frequency were the main contributors to risk outcome. Exposure to soil via accidental ingestion and dermal contact was below the safety limit, not posing a risk to human health. These findings can provide a baseline for the environmental management of the mining area and indicate the need for further research on As pollution in water and its implications on the health of the inhabitants of mining communities. © 2021","Gold mining is a significant source of metal(loid)s released into the environment. It is an issue of concern due to the potential adverse health effects associated with exposure to toxic elements. This study aimed to assess the ecological and human health risk caused by heavy metal(loid)s exposure in river sediments in Ponce Enríquez, one of the most important mining sites in Ecuador. Concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn were evaluated in 172 sediment samples to determine the Potential ecological risk (RI) and the carcinogenic (CR) and non-carcinogenic risk (HQ). The human exposure to polluted sediments during recreational activities was computed using Bayesian probabilistic models. Residents were randomly surveyed to adjust the risk models to the specific population data. More than 68% of the sampling stations pose a severe As and Cd ecological risk index (Eri > 320). Likewise, residents exposed to river sediments showed a non-acceptable carcinogenic risk by incidental ingestion, being As the primary contributor to overall cancer in both children and adults receptors. Moreover, non-carcinogenic risk through the incidental ingestion of sediments was above the safe limit for children. This is the first study conducted in a mining region in Ecuador that reveals the severe levels of ecological and human health risk to which the population is exposed. These results can be applied as a baseline to develop public health strategies to monitor and reduce the health hazards of the residents of mining communities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","The main function of an optimizer is to determine in what measure to change the weights and the learning rate of the neural network to reduce losses. One of the best known optimizers is Adam, which main advantage is the invariance of the magnitudes of the parameter updates with respect to the change of scale of the gradient. However, other optimizers are often chosen because they generalize in a better manner. AdamW is a variant of Adam where the weight decay is performed only after controlling the parameter-wise step size. In order to present a comparative scenario for optimizers in the present work, a Temperature Forecast for the Andean city of Quito using a neural network structure with uncertainty reduction was implemented and three optimizers (Adam, AdaMax and AdamW) were analyzed. In order to do the comparison three error metrics were obtained per hour in order to determine the effectiveness of the prediction. From the analysis it can be seen that Adam and AdaMax behave similarly reaching a maximum MSE per hour of 2.5°C nevertheless AdamW allows to reduce this error around 1.3°C. © 2021 IEEE.","The non-technical losses are an important problem for the electric networks in the Region.

Given the costs, small-and medium-sized livestock holders are not completely committed to it. The objective of this study was to determine true prevalence (TP) of bovine brucellosis in small-and medium-sized herd populations, as well as the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the Rose Bengal (RB) test and the sero-agglutination test (SAT)-EDTA using a Bayesian approach. Between 2011 and 2016, 2733 cattle herds were visited, and 22,592 animal blood samples were taken in nineteen provinces on mainland Ecuador. Bayes-p and deviance information criterion (DIC) statistics were used to select models. Additionally, risk-factor analysis was used for herds according to their brucellosis test status. True prevalence (TP) in herds was estimated by pool testing. National seroprevalence of farms was 7.9% (95% CI: 6.79–9.03), and TP was 12.2% (95% CI: 7.8–17.9). Apparent prevalence (AP) in animals was 2.2% (95% CI: 1.82–2.67), and TP was 1.6% (95% CrI: 1.0–2.4). Similarly, the sensitivity of the RB was estimated at 64.6% (95% CrI: 42.6–85.3) and specificity at 98.9% (95% CrI: 98.6–99.0); for the SAT-EDTA test, sensitivity was 62.3% (95% CrI: 40.0–84.8) and 98.9% (95% CrI: 98.6–99.1) for specificity. Results of the two tests were highly correlated in infected and uninfected animals. Likewise, high spatial variation was observed, with the Coastal Region being the zone with the highest TP at 2.5%. (95% CrI: 1.3–3.8%) in individual animals and 28.2% (95% CI: 15.7–39.8) in herds. Risk factors include herd size, type of production (milk, beef, and mixed), abortions recorded, and vaccination. The results of this study serve to guide authorities to make decisions based on parallel testing at the beginning of a bovine brucellosis program for small livestock holders to increase sensitivity level of the screening tests in Ecuador. © 2021 by the authors.

It is a new teaching-learning method in the Obstetrics course. To evaluate new methodologies, student opinion is the fundamental axis, and using the Likert scale is one of the most used tools. However, this collects quantitative data. On including ordinal measurements in its design, representing the categories of interest, the distances between the responses may not be the same. This may make it better to examine and interpret their results using ordinal analysis methods. Method: Cross-sectional study using a secondary source that included all first semester students of the degree. The results of the Likert-type questionnaire were compared using the classic t-test, Bayesian t-test, and Bayesian analysis with ordinal models. Results: There was a notable difference regarding the initial and final perception of students with the PIS methodology to achieve their objectives. Although the metric analysis models had questions that received a greater number of positive responses in the final survey, the ordinal method did not demonstrate this difference. Conclusion: The PIS methodology significantly and positively changed student perceptions as regards the fulfilment of their objectives. It is recommended to use ordinal methods, combined with Bayesian statistics, in the analysis of questionnaires using the Likert scale, in order to avoid errors in interpretation. © 2019 Elsevier España, S.L.U.","The Andean uplift is recognized as one of the most important events shaping the Neotropical biota. Previous phylogenetic reconstructions of Nasa, a mostly tropical Andean genus, have been unable to address its historical biogeography or ancestral character estimations in detail due to insufficient sampling and phylogenetic resolution. The main goal of the present study is to provide an expanded and highly resolved phylogenetic reconstruction of the genus to address these questions. We were able to sequence 87 of the 125 taxa (species and subspecies) of Nasa, for the plastid markers trnL-trnF, matK, trnS-trnG and rps16. Our results show that Nasa falls into four well-supported clades, clade I is sister to the rest of the genus and is composed of Central Andean species. The remaining three clades are more widely distributed, found also in the Amotape-Huancabamba Zone (AHZ) and the northern Andes. Our morphological analyses were able to identify plausible phylogenetic affinities of most Nasa spp. for which molecular data are unavailable, with three of the morphological clusters composed mostly by species of three well-supported clades (Clades II, III and IV). Historical biogeography indicates that Nasa has a history spanning 50 Myr, its early events predating most of the Andean uplift. Nasa appears to have originally occupied mid-elevation, seasonally dry habitats. By the mid-Miocene (c. 15 Mya) expansion into new forest edge and undergrowth habitats took place. This coincides with renewed uplift that increased the complexity of the abiotic conditions in the Andes. The AHZ is retrieved as the most important centre of diversification since the closure of the West Andean Portal and appears to be a cradle of clades of Nasa. Conversely, the central Andes, the most likely area of origin of the genus, house mostly ancient, species-poor clades. © 2021 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.","This paper proposes a framework to estimate the effects of exogenous fiscal policy and oil revenue shocks on the macroeconomic activity of price-taking oil producers. We use a structural vector autoregressive model estimated with Bayesian methods and apply it to the Ecuadorian economy. Specifically, we investigate the effects of unanticipated changes in taxes, government consumption spending, government investment spending, and oil revenues on economic activity. The results show that unanticipated expansive fiscal policy either through taxes or government investment can have positive effects on output. However, contrary to most studies in the literature, consumption spending shocks do not significantly affect gross domestic product. We also find that oil revenue shocks influence all the variables in the model, evidencing the vulnerability of the Ecuadorian economy to fluctuations of oil revenues. Historically, oil revenue shocks have been the most important driving force to move output above or below trend. © 2021","Understanding the geographic distributions of primates is necessary to ensure effective conservation strategies. Nonetheless, many gaps persist in information regarding the range limits of platyrrhines. Leontocebus lagonotus is no exception; it is one of the least studied primates in Ecuador and its geographic limits are poorly known. We obtained 296 records of its presence in Ecuador from field studies (between 1996 and 2020), museums, the literature, and databases. Of these, we validated 211 records and used 106 (excluding grouped points) to determine the potential distribution of this species using an ecological niche model (MaxEnt). The model suggested that the species’ distribution in Ecuador covers 64,028 km2. Based on confirmed data, the extent of occurrence was 38,226 km2, but after updating it with layers of remaining vegetation (2018), we determined that the current distribution is 32,643 km2 (a 15% reduction). Our findings reduce the range proposed for the species in Ecuador, suggesting that areas north of the Napo River, the north-central area of Yasuní National Park, and the far eastern part of Waorani Ethnic Reserve were never part of the species’ range. We also identified the southern boundaries of its distribution, where the Paute-Upano and Cangaime-Morona rivers form a natural barrier. Its distribution in Peru possibly reaches the south of the Morona and Santiago rivers. We recommend a similar approach for other platyrrhines, particularly those under threat, for better implementation of conservation efforts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","In this communication, using a generalized conformable differential operator, a simulation of the well-known Newton’s law of cooling is made. In particular, we use the conformable t1−α, e(1−α)t and non-conformable t−α kernels. The analytical solution for each kernel is given in terms of the conformable order derivative 0 < α ≤ 1. Then, the method for inverse problem solving, using Bayesian estimation with real temperature data to calculate the parameters of interest, is applied. It is shown that these conformable approaches have an advantage with respect to ordinary derivatives. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Background. Despite a large number of scientific disclosures on climate change issues, few studies show the effects on vegetation in high Andean ecosystems and especially within Protected Areas. Objective. Determine a predictive model using a radical scenario to establish the behavior of four species that make up the arboreal component of the forest remnants and their potential distribution for the year 2100. Methodology. By using 19 bioclimatic variables and the orography obtained from WorldClim, the QGIS software, MaxEnt and 221 occurrences of the four tree species, the current ecological niche was modeled and projected to 2100 based on the General Circulation Model (HadCM3) and the emissions of CO2 under the RCP 6.0 scenario. Results. In general, the result of the research envisions a highly negative outlook regarding the occupation area for 2100, determining that 125 ha will decrease due to the differentiation of temperature and precipitation (Bio7, Bio 14), however, 3734.63 ha will be created as new Proper sites to host these species due to the change that is specifically expected to the southeast of the reserve as a result of the increase in the planet's temperature. Implications. Results allow elaborating recommendations for adaptation to climate change and reducing future vulnerability. Conclusions. Due to the global importance that it represents for humanity and the complexity of the factors that influence the problem, a greater number of studies are necessary that contribute to a better understanding and contribute to the identification of risks and threats to generate timely adaptation strategies, mitigation and slowdown to the potential impacts of climate change. © 2021 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

These events have influenced the evolutionary history of numerous freshwater fishes in the region. Nonetheless, recent studies have shown that life-history traits and ecological characteristics of species may influence dispersal capabilities and the degree of genetic connectivity. Goodea (Cyprinodontiformes: Goodeidae) is one of the most widely distributed and environmentally tolerant genera of goodeids. In this study, the authors analysed variation in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to evaluate the phylogeographic relationships, genetic structure, genetic diversity and demographic history of Goodea from across its distribution range. They found low genetic differentiation and identified shared haplotypes among several regions. Geographic segregation was found in samples southwest and northeast of the Lower Lerma region, with some internal isolated groups showing phylogeographic differentiation and unique haplotypes. The AMOVA best explained genetic structure when grouped by haplogroups rather than when grouped by recognized biogeographic regions. Several regions showed null genetic diversity, raising the possibility of dispersal mediated by humans. Finally, Bayesian Skyline Plot analysis showed a population expansion for the Southwest haplogroup, except for the Armería population and sub-group II of the Northeast haplogroup. All this suggests a recent colonization of Goodea atripinnis throughout some of the biogeographic regions currently inhabited by this species. © 2020 Fisheries Society of the British Isles","Background: Checking the connectivity (structure) of complex Metabolic Reaction Networks (MRNs) models proposed for new microorganisms with promising properties is an important goal for chemical biology. Objective: In principle, we can perform a hand-on checking (Manual Curation). However, this is a challenging task due to the high number of combinations of pairs of nodes (possible metabolic reactions). Results: The CPTML linear model obtained using the LDA algorithm is able to discriminate nodes (metabolites) with the correct assignation of reactions from incorrect nodes with values of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity in the range of 85-100% in both training and external validation data series. Methods: In this work, we used Combinatorial Perturbation Theory and Machine Learning techniques to seek a CPTML model for MRNs >40 organisms compiled by Barabasis’ group. First, we quantified the local structure of a very large set of nodes in each MRN using a new class of node index called Markov linear indices fk. Next, we calculated CPT operators for 150000 combinations of query and reference nodes of MRNs. Last, we used these CPT operators as inputs of different ML algorithms. Conclusion: Meanwhile, PTML models based on Bayesian network, J48-Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms were identified as the three best non-linear models with accuracy greater than 97.5%. The present work opens the door to the study of MRNs of multiple organisms using PTML models. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.","The Chalupas Caldera is a rhyolitic volcano located in the Eastern Cordillera to the Southeast of the Cotopaxi Volcano in the Ecuadorian Andes. It is supposedly fed by a huge magmatic chamber below the caldera. For studying the Chalupas magmatic chamber, the tomographic models obtained by a Tarantola-Valette inversion and studied previously in the entire Ecuadorian region were used. The theoretical basis of the tomography method based on a Bayesian solution of the inverse problem is introduced. The process of the inverse problem regularization is obtained by an L-curve scheme to achieve an optimal solution. The seismic tomography images zoomed in the Chalupas region are well correlated with the main geological terranes and faults documented for the basement of Eastern Cordillera. Based on the tomographic images obtained, it can be assumed that there is not a magmatic chamber of considerable magnitude placed close to the surface underneath the Chalupas Caldera, since it does not present seismic and tomographic evidence to be able to assume a possible volcanic eruption before long. Furthermore, the images allow identifying that the seismic and thermal activity is located beneath the Cotopaxi Volcano as a vertical anomaly beneath the Northeast of Cotopaxi Volcano that corresponds to the phreatomagmatic activity observed in 2015. © 2021, Escola de Minas.

The research began with the identification and selection of drivers and emulation tools currently used in SDN. Then it is proposed to design and implement a test scenario based on evaluation metrics. The proposed system is based on learning a Bayesian network from the data extracted and processed from an SDN, looking for causal relationships between data values and the state of the network. To emulate the operation of a real SDN, a simulation has been designed with several linked scale-free networks, in which various types of traffic have been injected. The Bayesian network will be used later to diagnose new failures introduced into the network, reasoning with the data extracted from it. Finally, the results obtained with the OpenDayLight controller, the OpenFlow protocol and the Mininet emulator are analyzed. © 2021, University of Cienfuegos, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.

Previous global investigations of mammal functional diversity have relied on range maps instead of observational data to determine community composition. We test the effects of species pools, habitat heterogeneity, primary productivity and human disturbance on the functional diversity (dispersion and richness) of mammal communities using the largest standardized tropical forest camera trap monitoring system, the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network. We use occupancy values derived from the camera trap data to calculate occupancy-weighted functional diversity and use Bayesian generalized linear regression to determine the effects of multiple predictors. Mammal community functional dispersion increased with primary productivity, while functional richness decreased with human-induced local extinctions and was significantly lower in Madagascar than other tropical regions. The significant positive relationship between functional dispersion and productivity was evident only when functional dispersion was weighted by species' occupancies. Thus, observational data from standardized monitoring can reveal the drivers of mammal communities in ways that are not readily apparent from range map-based studies. The positive association between occupancy-weighted functional dispersion of tropical forest mammal communities and primary productivity suggests that unique functional traits may be more beneficial in more productive ecosystems and may allow species to persist at higher abundances. © 2021 The Authors.","In this article we present the mathematical compartmental SARS-CoV-2 model, with asymptomatic patients, used by the Research Center on Mathematical Modelling (MODEMAT) to study the spread of the virus in Ecuador, as well as the developed Bayesian variational approach to estimate the model parameters, under uncertainty of the observed data.

Recent studies on foraging strategies show a higher complexity than previously thought due to intraspecific variability. To reliably identify foraging strategies and describe the different foraging niches they allow individual animals to realize, high-resolution multivariate approaches which consider individual variation are required. Here we dive into the foraging strategies of Galápagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), a tropical predator confronted with substantial annual variation in sea surface temperature. This affects prey abundance, and El Niño events, expected to become more frequent and severe with climate change, are known to have dramatic effects on sea lions. This study used high-resolution measures of depth, GPS position and acceleration collected from 39 lactating sea lion females to analyze their foraging strategies at an unprecedented level of detail using a novel combination of automated broken stick algorithm, hierarchical cluster analysis and individually fitted multivariate hidden Markov models. We found three distinct foraging strategies (pelagic, benthic, and night divers), which differed in their horizontal, vertical and temporal distribution, most likely corresponding to different prey species, and allowed us to formulate hypotheses with regard to adaptive values under different environmental scenarios. We demonstrate the advantages of our multivariate approach and inclusion of individual variation to reliably gain a deeper understanding of the adaptive value and ecological relevance of foraging strategies of marine predators in dynamic environments. © 2021, The Author(s).","The use of optimizers makes it possible to reduce losses during the learning process of a neural network. Currently there are some types of optimizers whose effectiveness has already been proven, an example of this is Adam. Adam is an extension to Stochastic Gradient Decent that makes use of Momentum and Adaptive Learning to converge faster. An interesting alternative to complement the Adam's work is the addition of weight decay. This is done to decouple the weight decay from the gradient-based update. Some attempts have been developed previously, however its correct operation has not been keenly proven. In this work, a weight decay decoupling alternative is presented and acutely analyzed. The algorithm's convergence is mathematically verified and its operation too through the use of a Convolutional Encoder-Decoder network and the application of strategies for error reduction. The AdamL operation is verified by the achievement of a proper Temperature Forecast with a percentage error lower than 4.5%. It can be seen too that the forecast error deepens around noon but it does not exceed 1.47°C. © 2021 IEEE.","In the present work, a novel Convolutional LSTM Encoder-Decoder structure for the implementation of Weather Forecast for the Andean city of Quito is presented. Aside from the above, the Encoder-Decoder structure uses a Walk-Forward validation, an adjustment of the Bayesian posterior predictive distribution and the ADAMW optimizer to carry out the forecast. The aforementioned stages are combined to obtain 4 error metrics per hour. The prediction is done in base of acquired data from a network of Automatic Weather Stations. The results show that the Convolutional Encoder-Decoder structure with a dropout probability of 0.05 and a model precision equal to 0.1 performs better than a LSTM model, LSTM Stacked model or ARIMA models reaching a maximum error of 1.03 °C. Finally, the methodology could be applied as an effective option to implement the post-processing stage for the physical model of a Weather Forecast System. © 2021 IEEE.","This work introduces a new modified IEEE 33-node test system to be smart by implementing distributed renewable generation, smart metering load characteristics, and optimal installation of capacitors. The Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) technique is adopted to compute the optimal sizing and placement of capacitor in the original network. Then, to assess the reliability of the original and modified test systems, a sequential Monte Carlo simulation takes place. The relevant contribution of this paper is that it offers a comprehensive approach of a reliability assessment in a distribution system, where several smart features have been implemented. In addition, the modified system opens a pathway for future research in which smart distribution system analysis is required related mainly to reliability assessment. © 2021 IEEE","The unobserved losses have been a challenge to the applicability of automatic systems for inventory control. Due to the inability to record these events, systems cannot make the best decisions. In this sense, it is necessary to account for these losses to learn policies that allow inventory to be managed automatically. In this work, reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to an inventory management problem with unobserved losses. To do so, an inventory level inference model that considers unobserved losses was used. This solution does not depend on any distribution assumptions over sales and unobserved losses, but rather it estimates the distributions solely from observations and inputs of the system. During training, the model learns the transition and observation functions as distributions over inventory levels. The model simultaneously accounts state uncertainty and computes beliefs over inventory states. After the model is trained, it can be combined with a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, such as Q-learning, to determine a policy for the inventory management. This policy can be used as automated system for the management of the inventory. The results suggests that this system can improve the inventory management performance by reducing the uncertainty of inventory levels without specifying the transition and observation distributions. © 2021 IEEE.","Kajikia audax, Thunnus albacares, Katsuwonus pelamis, and Auxis spp. occupy high and middle-level trophic positions in the food web. They represent important sources for fisheries in Ecuador. Despite their ecological and economic importance, studies on pelagic species in Ecuador are scarce. This study uses stable isotope analysis to assess the trophic ecology of these species, and to determine the contribution of prey to the predator tissue. Isotope data was used to test the hypothesis that medium-sized pelagic fish species have higher δ15N values than those of the prey they consumed, and that there is no overlap between their δ13C and δ15N values. Results showed higher δ15N values for K. audax, followed by T. albacares, Auxis spp. and K. pelamis, which indicates that the highest position in this food web is occupied by K. audax. The stable isotope Bayesian ellipses demonstrated that on a long time-scale, these species do not compete for food sources. Moreover, δ15N values were different between species and they decreased with a decrease in predator size. © 2021 The Authors.","Event-Related Potentials (ERP) detection is a latent problem in the clinical, neuroscience, and engineering fields. It is an open challenge that contributes to achieving more accurate and adaptable Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). The state-of-the-art typically uses simple classifiers based on Discriminant Analysis due to their little computational demand. Some more recent approaches have started using Deep Learning techniques, but these do not provide any temporal information and rarely focus on detecting the P300 at sample level in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which would improve the Information Transfer Rate in BCIs. In other research areas, recurrent neural networks have shown high performance in those tasks that require online responses. We propose a new methodology, based on Long-Short Term Memory networks, in a sample level forecast to predict the P300 signal continuously. We get a slight improvement concerning the standard procedure, typically Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis, and we also show that the model predicts the occurrence of the P300 ERP at sample level in EEG signals. This brings us the possibility of evaluating the inherent variation between subjects. Our approach contributes to more agile and adaptable BCIs development, going further in the real-life usage of BCIs. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","The analysis of connectivity in brain networks has been widely researched and it has been shown that certain cognitive processes require the integration of distributed brain areas. Functional connectivity attempts to statistically quantify the interdependence between these brain areas. In this paper, we propose an analysis of functional connectivity in the Event-Related Potential (ERP) context, more specifically on the P300 component using the Granger Causality measure. To this end, we propose a methodology that consists in quantifying the causality in the P300 and non-P300 signals in the context of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Causality is calculated using two approaches: i) using standard electrodes and, ii) using electrodes selected using Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis and sequential forward electrode selection (BLDA-FS). Based on this analysis, it is shown that the Granger Causality metric is valid to show a significant connectivity difference between P300 and non-P300 signals. The electrodes selected using BLDA-FS were found to be more discriminative in this regard. Studying functional connectivity using Granger Causality allowed us to identify the changes in connectivity detected during the presence of a target stimulus compared to a non-target stimulus. This additional information about the connectivity differences found can be incorporated as a new feature in further studies, allowing for better detection of the P300 signal and consequently improving the performance of P300-based BCIs. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","A brain-computer interface (BCI) detects brain activity and converts it to external commands, facilitating the interaction with external devices. One way to implement a BCI is through event-related potentials (ERP), which are positive or negative voltage deflections detected by electroencephalography (EEG) through conductive electrodes. A very promising technology of dry electrodes has been used in recent years, which is much easier and faster to install; useful also for daily life applications. But the disadvantage is that its signal-to-noise ratio is lower compared to traditional wet electrodes technology. Thus, we hypothesized that an appropriate selection of dry electrodes allows the recovery of much more information than traditional standard electrodes and therefore improves the BCI performance. This work shows the importance of electrode selection to obtain a better detection of the ERPs of the EEG signal with a minimum number of electrodes in a personalized manner. To illustrate this problem, we designed a BCI experiment based on P300-ERPs with a dry electrodes wireless EEG system and we evaluated its performance with two electrode selection methodologies designed for this purpose in 12 subjects. The experimental analysis of this work shows that our electrode selection methodology allows the P300-ERPs to be detected with greater precision than a standard electrode set choice. Besides, this minimum electrode selection methodology allows dealing with the well-known problem of inter- and intrasubject variability of the EEG signal, thus customizing the optimal selection of electrodes for each individual. This work contributes to the design of more friendly BCIs through a reduction in the number of electrodes, thus promoting more precise, comfortable, and lightweight equipment for real-life BCI applications. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","It is proposed to develop a prototype platform based on artificial vision that allows us to identify the defects that ceramic tiles have, with which we can classify them according to their quality. The algorithms chosen to develop the platform are Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The SVM algorithm has the characteristic that, a priori, we know the classes to which our individuals belong, it is not a grouping by similarities, but we have well-defined classes, in the treatment of images there is a high percentage of effectiveness of this algorithm. On the other hand, because of its ease of implementation, the KNN algorithm is one of the most widely used non-parametric classifiers. Its theoretical properties guarantee that its error probability is bounded by twice the Bayesian error probability, in the treatment of images with this algorithm there are high percentages of effectiveness in the classification The necessary parameters are established for the proposal based on the study of related works and the same application methodology is presented, which contemplates the pre-processing of the images, the obtaining of the descriptors, the use of the algorithms and the results obtained. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","In this article, an estimation methodology based on the sequential Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed, that jointly estimate the states and parameters, the relationship between the prices of futures contracts and the spot prices of primary products is determined, the evolution of prices and the volatility of the historical data of the primary market (Gold and Soybean) are analyzed. Two stochastic models for an estimate the states and parameters are considered, the parameters and states describe physical measure (associated with the price) and risk-neutral measure (associated with the markets to futures), the price dynamics in the short-term through the reversion to the mean and volatility are determined, while that in the long term through markets to futures. Other characteristics such as seasonal patterns, price spikes, marketdependent volatilities, and non-seasonality can also be observed. In the methodology, a parameter learning algorithm is used, specifically, three algorithms are proposed, that is the sequential Monte Carlo estimation (SMC) for state space models with unknown parameters: the first method is considered a particle filter that is based on the sampling algorithm of sequential importance with resampling (SISR). The second implemented method is the Storvik algorithm [19], the states and parameters of the posterior distribution are estimated that have supported in low-dimensional spaces, a sufficient statistics from the sample of the filtered distribution is considered. The third method is (PLS) Carvalho's Particle Learning and Smoothing algorithm [31]. The cash prices of the contracts with future delivery dates are analyzed. The results indicate postponement of payment, the future prices on different maturity dates with the spot price are highly correlated. Likewise, the contracts with a delivery date for the last periods of the year 2017, the spot price lower than the prices of the contracts with expiration date for 12 and 24 months is found, opposite occurs in the contracts with expiration date for 1 and 6 months. © 2021 International Academic Press.

It is performed using a standard data system called Time and Motion Study (TMS). Many industries still rely on direct human effort to execute the TMS methodology which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive. In this paper, we introduce an automatic replacement of the TMS technique that works at two levels of abstraction: primitive and activity actions. We leverage on recent advancements in deep learning methods and employ an encoder-decoder based classifier to recognize primitives and a continuous-time hidden Markov model to recognize activities. We show that our system yields results competitive with those obtained with several common human action recognition models. We also show how our proposed system can help operational decisions by computing productivity indicators such as worker availability, worker performance, and overall labor effectiveness. © 2013 IEEE.","Xylotrechus arvicola is an emerging grape pest that generates serious sanitary problems in vineyards and is currently expanding its range throughout Spain. The increasing prevalence of this pest in Spanish vineyards has been detected since 1990. In this study, the relationship between the climate and the actual distribution of the beetle was analysed, as well as how this distribution might change in the future according to several climate change models. The methodology was based on predictive models (SDM; species distribution modelling) using climate variables as explanatory factors, although the relationships were not necessarily causal. Maxent was used as the SDM method. The current climatic niche was calculated, and the actual potential distribution area was estimated. The relationships between the climate variables and the species probability of the presence were projected to various future climate change scenarios. The main conclusions reached were that climate change will favour the expansion of X. arvicola and that the potential infestation zones will be extended significantly. Although the results, because they were based on hypothetical climate frameworks that are under constant revision, were not conclusive, they should be taken into consideration when defining future strategies in the wine industry. © 2021 Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

Objective: To estimate the epidemiological profile of pediatric patients with COVID-19, as well as their clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics. Materials and methods: A living systemic review was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus and SciELO databases. Observational studies describing clinical, radiological, and laboratory characteristics of pediatric patients with COVID-19 and published between January 1, 2020, and July 20, 2020, were considered for the search; there were no language restrictions. Government, epidemiological, and pre-print papers were also considered. Meta-analyses of single proportion (frequentist approach) and two proportions (Bayesian method) were carried out. The study registration and protocol are available at https://osf.io/y43wm and https://osf.io/r8ktv, respectively. Results: 13 studies, with a total of 9 152 patients, were retrieved. The Bayesian meta-analysis reported that males are more affected by the disease: OR 1.24 (HDI95%: 1.09-1.4). The proportion results calculated by means of the frequentist meta-analysis are: 52% cough (95%CI: 50-55), 0% death (95%CI: 0-0.1), 16% high aspartate transaminase levels (95%CI: 13-19), and 60% lung changes observed in chest X-ray (95%CI: 57-64). Conclusions: Based on the current data, it is not possible to describe accurately the clinical and ep-idemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in the pediatric population. However, evidence suggests that males are more affected by the disease and that lung alterations in imaging studies are more frequent than clinical signs such as cough and fever. Laboratory test results are not conclusive and show that different organs and systems of the human body may be affected by SARS-CoV-2. The results reported here must be compared to prospective controlled studies conducted in larger sam-ples and a more rigorous design. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

We used isotope analysis of blue whale skin strata (n = 621) and potential prey (n = 300) to examine their migratory and foraging strategies in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Our results suggest that most whales in the northeast Pacific use a mixed income and capital breeding strategy, and use the California Current Ecosystem as their primary summer-fall foraging ground. A subset of individuals exhibited migratory plasticity and spend most of the year in the Gulf of California or Costa Rica Dome, two regions believed to be their primary winter-spring breeding grounds. Isotope data also revealed that whales in the southern Eastern Tropical Pacific generally do not forage in the northeast Pacific, which suggests a north-south population structure with a boundary near the equator. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Introgression and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) are two of the main sources of gene-tree incongruence; both can confound the assessment of phylogenetic relationships among closely related species. The Triatoma phyllosoma species group is a clade of partially co-distributed and cross-fertile Chagas disease vectors. Despite previous efforts, the phylogeny of this group remains unresolved, largely because of substantial gene-tree incongruence. Here, we sequentially address introgression and ILS to provide a robust phylogenetic hypothesis for the T. phyllosoma species group. To identify likely instances of introgression prior to molecular scrutiny, we assessed biogeographic data and information on fertility of inter-specific crosses. We first derived a few explicit hybridization hypotheses by considering the degree of spatial overlap within each species pair. Then, we assessed the plausibility of these hypotheses in the light of each species pair's cross-fertility. Using this contextual information, we evaluated mito-nuclear (cyt b, ITS-2) gene-tree incongruence and found evidence suggesting introgression within two species pairs. Finally, we modeled ILS using a Bayesian multispecies coalescent approach and either (a) a “complete” dataset with all the specimens in our sample, or (b) a “filtered” dataset without putatively introgressed specimens. The “filtered tree” had higher posterior-probability support, as well as more plausible topology and divergence times, than the “complete tree.” Detecting and filtering out introgression and modeling ILS allowed us to derive an improved phylogenetic hypothesis for the T. phyllosoma species group. Our results illustrate how biogeographic and ecological-reproductive contextual information can help clarify the systematics and evolution of recently diverged taxa prone to introgression and ILS. © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","The lichen family Teloschistaceae from the Galapagos is revised. Most of the species belong to the Caloplacoideae, two to Teloschistoideae and a few to Xanthorioideae, three subfamilies not validly published, which is remedied here. Four different datasets were analyzed using Bayesian inference. For the bulk of the species, a combined dataset of nrITS, nrLSU and mrSSU was analyzed. Additionally, three analyses were performed using nrITS to further investigate phylogenetic relationships within and between species in each subfamily, and in the genera Xanthomendoza and Squamulea. Four new genera are described: Lacrima, Oceanoplaca, Phaeoplaca, Sucioplaca. Twenty-four species are reported, of which ten are new to science: Caloplaca nigra, Lacrima galapagoensis, Oceanoplaca chemoisidiosa, O. sideritoides, Phaeoplaca tortuca, Squamulea chelonia, S. humboldtiana, S. osseophila, S. oceanica, and Xanthomendoza leoncita. Several new combinations are proposed and three species of Xanthomendoza are reduced to synonymy. Several new combinations and species placed into synonymy do not occur in the Galapagos, but are treated as a consequence of our taxonomic revision. Morphology, anatomy, secondary chemistry, distribution and molecular phylogenetic affiliation are presented for each species and a key is provided. Eight different chemical patterns are quantitatively described based on HPLC analyses. The new genus Lacrima includes L. galapagoensis, a species without vegetative propagules, and two densely isidiate species, L. epiphora and L. aphanotripta that are morphologically similar to 'Caloplaca' wrightii. The only species of Galapagos Teloschistaceae that contains xanthones is placed into Huneckia. Oceanoplaca includes two species with the new anthraquinone isidiosin, O. isidiosa and O. chemoisidiosa, while a third species, O. sideritoides, does not contain this secondary metabolite. Phaeoplaca camptidia has previously been reported from Galapagos, but our phylogenetic analysis suggests that it is a new species, here named P. tortuca. An isolated position is occupied by 'Caloplaca' diplacia, which we place in it its own monotypic genus Sucioplaca. Some Galapagos Teloschistaceae can be considered a 'residue' of unresolved Caloplaca s.l., i.e. the corticolous C. floridana is possibly related to the saxicolous C. nigra, while C. cupulifera can currently not be placed. Squamulea remains particularly problematic and includes S. phyllidizans, that is nested among otherwise unresolved Squamulea species. Based on molecular data, S. phyllidizans is close to 'Huriella'. 'Huriella' flakusii, described from Peru, is confirmed to occur in the Galapagos and the genus is reduced to synonymy with Squamulea. The Squamulea squamosa/subsoluta group remains largely unresolved, but the new species S. chelonia, S. humboldtiana, S. oceanica, and S. osseophila are phylogenetically distinct. Foliose Teloschistaceae are represented only by one species, described as Xanthomendoza leoncita, while the only fruticose species, Teloschistes chrysophthalmus and T. flavicans, are cosmopolitan. © 2020 W.

Methods: We identified clinical trials posted on the ClinicalTrials.gov database focused on Oncology trials with a Bayesian approach in their design. Differences in study characteristics such as design, study phase, randomization, masking, purpose of study, main outcomes, gender, age and funding involvement according to Bayesian approach were assessed using Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests. Results: We identified 225 studies with Bayesian components in their design addressing oncological diseases. The most common designs were Bayesian Toxicity Monitoring (26.4%), Model-based designs (36%) Model-assisted designs (8%). Statistical methods such as Bayesian logistic regression model (59.4%), Bayesian piecewise exponential survival regression (10.9%) and the Continual reassessment method (9.4%) were the most used. Conclusions: Bayesian trials are more common in the early phases of drug development specifically in phase II trials (43.6%). Cancer institutes or Hospitals funded most of the studies retrieved. This type of design has increased over time and represent an innovative means of increasing trial efficiency. © 2020","Tropical regions cover approximately 36% of the Earth’s landmass. These regions are home to 40% of the world’s population, which is projected to increase to over 50% by 2030 under a remarkable climate variability scenario often exacerbated by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and other climate teleconnections. In the tropics, ecohydrological conditions are typically under the influence of complex land-ocean-atmosphere interactions that produce a dynamic cycling of mass and energy reflected in a clear partition of water fluxes. Here, we present a review of 7 years of a concerted and continuous water stable isotope monitoring across Costa Rica, including key insights learned, main methodological advances and limitations (both in experimental designs and data analysis), potential data gaps, and future research opportunities with a humid tropical perspective. The uniqueness of the geographic location of Costa Rica within the mountainous Central America Isthmus, receiving moisture inputs from the Caribbean Sea (windward) and the Pacific Ocean (complex leeward topography), and experiencing strong ENSO events, poses a clear advantage for the use of isotopic variations to underpin key drivers in ecohydrological responses. In a sequential approach, isotopic variations are analyzed from moisture transport, rainfall generation, and groundwater/surface connectivity to Bayesian and rainfall-runoff modeling. The overarching goal of this review is to provide a robust humid tropical example with a progressive escalation from common water isotope observations to more complex modeling outputs and applications to enhance water resource management in the tropics. © Copyright © 2020 Sánchez-Murillo, Esquivel-Hernández, Birkel, Correa, Welsh, Durán-Quesada, Sánchez-Gutiérrez and Poca.","Fast and accurate identification of biting midges is crucial in the study of Culicoides-borne diseases. In this work, we propose a two-stage method for automatically analyzing Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) species. First, an image preprocessing task composed of median and Wiener filters followed by equalization and morphological operations is used to improve the quality of the wing image in order to allow an adequate segmentation of particles of interest. Then, the segmentation of the zones of interest inside the biting midge wing is made using the watershed transform. The proposed method is able to produce optimal feature vectors that help to identify Culicoides species. A database containing wing images of C. obsoletus, C. pusillus, C. foxi, and C. insignis species was used to test its performance. Feature relevance analysis indicated that the mean of hydraulic radius and eccentricity were relevant for the decision boundary between C. obsoletus and C. pusillus species. In contrast, the number of particles and the mean of the hydraulic radius was relevant for deciding between C. foxi and C. insignis species. Meanwhile, for distinguishing among the four species, the number of particles and zones, and the mean of circularity were the most relevant features. The linear discriminant analysis classifier was the best model for the three experimental classification scenarios previously described, achieving averaged areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98, 0.90, and 0.96, respectively. © 2020 Venegas et al.

Currently, Floridosentis includes two species, F. mugilis, distributed in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic Ocean coast, and F. pacifica, restricted to the Pacific Ocean coast. The aim of this study was to explore the species limit of both species of the genus Floridosentis, collected in 37 localities in eight countries: Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Venezuela. We sequenced 253 specimens to build a comprehensive dataset for three genes: the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox 1) from mitochondrial DNA, the internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2 including the 5.8S gene (ITS region), and the D2 + D3 domains of the large subunit (LSU) of nuclear DNA. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses with the cox 1 and concatenated (cox 1 + ITS+LSU) datasets were conducted. Two species delimitation methods were implemented, the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD), and Bayesian species delimitation (BPP), plus a haplotype network inferred with 253 specimens, allowing us to validate two nominal species of Floridosentis., F. mugilis, plus one linage distributed in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic Ocean coast, and F. pacifica, plus two additional lineages distributed along the Pacific Ocean coast. All these lineages are shared by both species of mullet (Mugil curema and M. cephalus). The currents in the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, in combination with the biology of the definitive hosts, have played a key role in the distribution of the two nominal species and of the three lineages of Floridosentis across the Americas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Distributed generation is essential for smart distribution systems. This prospect mainly depends on the efficient use of renewable resources. Therefore, it is compelling to provide an optimum design framework that allows a thorough modeling to select the most convenient size, location, and renewable energy combination that maximize system reliability on a distribution network. This paper presents an optimization-based framework to design a distributed generation system by incorporating an optimal reliability assessment with wind, solar, and tidal energies. The network planning exercise considers the stochastic nature of the network's state by including time-series models and hourly-based analysis to accurately determine the reliability indexes. Historical meteorological data has been used to model and deploy a set of renewable energy distributed generators which maximize reliability in a 37-bus primary-distribution network. Due to the probabilistic modeling of the system's components, a Sequential Monte-Carlo simulation is used to manage reliability evaluation at the network level. Although large reductions on energy-not-supplied are expected, it is shown that cost and other performance indexes do not follow the same trend, and project selection requires some compromise between cost and performance. © 2020","The genus Triatoma contains numerous species, principal or secondary vectors of Chagas disease, which have been included in the three main lineages of Triatomini tribe based on morphological and biogeographical characteristics: North American, South American, and T. dispar complex. The three members of the T. dispar complex are distributed in Ecuador. This complex has been scarcely studied through molecular approaches, and the taxonomic position of this complex is not confirmed. In this study, we explored the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Triatoma, including five species from North and Central America, six from South America, and the three species belonging to the T. dispar complex. Partial sequences of four mitochondrial genes (Cyt b, COII, 16S-rRNA, 12S-rRNA) and two nuclear genes (18S-rRNA, ITS2) were obtained from 74 specimens. Phylogenetic trees were built with concatenated and single sequences through maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP), and Bayesian methods. The trees built using concatenated sequences showed three main branches (clusters) highly supported by significant bootstrap values; the T. dispar complex appeared as a monophyletic group separate from species of North and Central American origin and South American origin. On the contrary, for each gene tree, the three main clusters were not always significantly supported, mostly because genetic information is dramatically reduced when a single gene is considered. Consequently, concatenation of genes gives relevant results and is highly recommended for further in-depth examination of the relationships of several species and complexes of triatomines that remain unresolved. Moreover, our current molecular data fully revealed the division of genus Triatoma into at least three main genetic groups. © 2020","The Ecological Footprint is defined as the ecological impact caused by human activities, such as agriculture, fishing, raising livestock, and building infrastructure. A high level of Ecological Footprint index is linked to high consumption of natural resources, which causes a negative impact on the environment. Few studies analyze the Ecological Footprint and its determinants considering the effects of neighboring countries. Therefore, we research whether the Ecological Footprints of 158 countries are spatially correlated, as well as their determinants. We retrieve the data from the Global Footprint Network and the World Bank for ten years (2007–2016) and apply a dynamic spatial Durbin model. Unlike previous studies of spatial dependence, we estimate the direct, indirect and total effects of biocapacity, trade openness and GDP on the Ecological Footprint in the short-run and long-run horizons. Our results detect significant spatial effects. We find that biocapacity, trade openness and GDP increase the Ecological Footprint of countries, however, the former two exhibit significant indirect effects in both horizons while the latter one display significant direct effects. These effects account for a significant share of the variation of the Ecological Footprint. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results to academics and policymakers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Border regions have been implicated as important hot spots of malaria transmission, particularly in Latin America, where free movement rights mean that residents can cross borders using just a national ID. Additionally, rural livelihoods largely depend on short-term migrants traveling across borders via the Amazon’s river networks to work in extractive industries, such as logging. As a result, there is likely considerable spillover across country borders, particularly along the border between Peru and Ecuador. This border region exhibits a steep gradient of transmission intensity, with Peru having a much higher incidence of malaria than Ecuador. In this paper, we integrate 13 years of weekly malaria surveillance data collected at the district level in Peru and the canton level in Ecuador, and leverage hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal regression models to identify the degree to which malaria transmission in Ecuador is influenced by transmission in Peru. We find that increased case incidence in Peruvian districts that border the Ecuadorian Amazon is associated with increased incidence in Ecuador. Our results highlight the importance of coordinated malaria control across borders. © 2020 by the authors.

Low-cost sensor technologies have emerged as an affordable solution to cope with this deficiency. However, since low-cost sensors are built with low-cost materials, they are prone to errors, gaps, bias, and noise. These problems need to be solved before data can be used to support research or decision making. Addressing lack of reliability in low-cost sensor data is a complex challenge that is still under research over several lines (e.g. accuracy estimation of low-cost sensor data). Current approaches in this line involve modeling, bias-correction, and more recently, data fusion methods relying on high-resolution air quality computational models. Overall, accuracy estimation can be reduced to a modeling problem. The focus of this work is studying, testing, and comparing suitable approaches for handling point-referenced spatio-temporal sensor data, particularly classical spatial models, spatio-temporal models, and popular machine learning methods. Among these approaches, Bayesian hierarchical models have a special consideration given the attention they have drawn during the last fifteen years. The benchmark supporting this comparison study is a real-life dataset made up of daily ozone observations taken from the USA Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and meteorological variables extracted from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project (NNRP). The main contributions of this work are: (1) a systematic comparison of three kinds of models, using a 10-fold cross-validation exercise; and (2) a feature engineering method to create covariates meant to harness spatially correlated observations of point-referenced sensor data. © 2020 IEEE.","The largest mercury (Hg) mining district in the world is located in Almadén (Spain), with well-known environmental impacts in the surrounding ecosystem. However, the impact of mercury on the health of the inhabitants of this area has not been documented accordingly. This study aims to carry out a probabilistic human health risk assessment using Bayesian modeling to estimate the non-carcinogenic risk related to Hg through multiple exposure pathways. Samples of vegetables, wild mushrooms, fish, soil, water, and air were analyzed, and adult residents were randomly surveyed to adjust the risk models to the specific population data. On the one hand, the results for the non-carcinogenic risk based on Hazard Quotient (HQ) showed unacceptable risk levels through ingestion of Hg-contaminated vegetables and fish, with HQ values 20 and 3 times higher, respectively, than the safe exposure threshold of 1 for the 97.5th percentile. On the other hand, ingestion of mushrooms, dermal contact with soil, ingestion of water, dermal contact with water and inhalation of air, were below the safety limit for the 97.5th percentile, and did not represent a risk to the health of residents. In addition, the probabilistic approach was compared with the conservative deterministic approach, and similar results were obtained. This is the first study conducted in Almadén, which clearly reveals the high levels of human health risk to which the population is exposed due to the legacy of two millennia of Hg mining. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Malaria is a vector-borne disease of significant public health concern. Despite widespread success of many elimination initiatives, elimination efforts in some regions of the world have stalled. Barriers to malaria elimination include climate and land use changes, such as warming temperatures and urbanization, which can alter mosquito habitats. Socioeconomic factors, such as political instability and regional migration, also threaten elimination goals. This is particularly relevant in areas where local elimination has been achieved and consequently surveillance and control efforts are dwindling and are no longer a priority. Understanding how environmental change, impacts malaria elimination has important practical implications for vector control and disease surveillance strategies. It is important to consider climate change when monitoring the threat of malaria resurgence due to socioeconomic influences. However, there is limited assessment of how the combination of climate variation, interventions and socioeconomic pressures influence long-term trends in malaria transmission and elimination efforts. In this study, we used Bayesian hierarchical mixed models and malaria case data for a 29-year period to disentangle the impacts of climate variation and malaria control efforts on malaria risk in the Ecuadorian province of El Oro, which achieved local elimination in 2011. We found shifting patterns of malaria between rural and urban areas, with a relative increase of Plasmodium vivax in urbanized areas. Minimum temperature was an important driver of malaria seasonality and the association between warmer minimum temperatures and malaria incidence was greater for Plasmodium falciparum compared to P. vivax malaria. There was considerable heterogeneity in the impact of three chemical vector control measures on both P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria. We found statistically significant associations between two of the three measures [indoor residual spraying (IRS) and space spraying] and a reduction in malaria incidence, which varied between malaria type. We also found environmental suitability for malaria transmission is increasing in El Oro, which could limit future elimination efforts if malaria is allowed to re-establish. Our findings have important implications for understanding environmental obstacles to malaria elimination and highlights the importance of designing and sustaining elimination efforts in areas that remain vulnerable to resurgence. © Copyright © 2020 Fletcher, Stewart-Ibarra, Sippy, Carrasco-Escobar, Silva, Beltran-Ayala, Ordoñez, Adrian, Sáenz, Drakeley, Jones and Lowe.","Unraveling the relationship between humidity, wind, and rainfall is vitally important to understand the dynamics of water vapor transport. In recent years, the use of causal networks to identify causal flows has gained much ground in the field of climatology to provide new insights about physical processes and hypothesize previously unknown ones. In this paper, the concept of a virtual control volume is proposed, which resembles the Eulerian description of a vector field, but is based on causal flows instead. A virtual control surface is used to identify the influence of surrounding climatic processes on the control volume (i.e., the study region). Such an influence is characterized by using a causal inference method that gives information about its direction and strength. The proposed approach was evaluated by inferring and spatially delineating areas of influence of humidity and wind on the rainfall of Ecuador. It was possible to confirm known patterns of influence, such as the influence of the Pacific Ocean on the coast and the influence of the Atlantic Ocean on the Amazon. Moreover, the approach was able to identify plausible new hypotheses, such as the influence of humidity on rainfall in the northern part of the boundary between the Andes and the Amazon, as well as the origin (the Amazon or the tropical Atlantic) and the altitude at which surrounding humidity and wind influence rainfall within the control volume. These hypotheses highlight the ability of the approach to exploit a large amount of scalar data and identify pathways of influence between climatic variables. © 2020 by the authors.","This paper provides a solution for fast haptic information gain during soft tissue palpation using a Variable Lever Mechanism (VLM) probe. More specifically, we investigate the impact of stiffness variation of the probe to condition likelihood functions of the kinesthetic force and tactile sensors measurements during a palpation task for two sweeping directions. Using knowledge obtained from past probing trials or Finite Element (FE) simulations, we implemented this likelihood conditioning in an autonomous palpation control strategy. Based on a recursive Bayesian inferencing framework, this new control strategy adapts the sweeping direction and the stiffness of the probe to detect abnormal stiff inclusions in soft tissues. This original control strategy for compliant palpation probes shows a sub-millimeter accuracy for the 3D localization of the nodules in a soft tissue phantom as well as a 100% reliability detecting the existence of nodules in a soft phantom. © 2020 Herzig et al.

Consequently, insights into ecosystem functioning in relation to exploitation are needed as a basis for socioeconomically acceptable mitigation of these impacts. A Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model is developed to link three major ecosystem services (ES), i.e. food production, water provision and ecotourism, and determine the effect of local agricultural practices and management on the ES in the Guayas Basin (Ecuador). Several data sources were integrated into the BBN model, including processed spatial data from primary and secondary sources, sampling and survey data, and expert knowledge. The model suggests that banana and sugar cane generate the highest yield but provide low ecotourism benefits. In contrast, cacao produces the lowest yields but contributes to better water quality. Scenario analyses suggest that environmental gains are possible by optimising the land use (LU) based on the edaphoclimatic requirements of crops. Moreover, the integration of LU optimisation with upscaling and farming intensification can allow for additional advantages in water provision and ecotourism while mitigating productivity losses. The BBN development approach can serve as a reference for other case studies, where data scarcity plays a limiting factor in the assessment of interactions between key ES. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","We present data showing that the number of salamander species in Amazonia is vastly underestimated. We used DNA sequences of up to five genes (3 mitochondrial and 2 nuclear) of 366 specimens, 189 corresponding to 89 non-Amazonian nominal species and 177 Amazonian specimens, including types or topotypes, of eight of the nine recognized species in the region. By including representatives of all known species of Amazonian Bolitoglossa, except for one, and 73% of the currently 132 recognized species of the genus, our dataset represents the broadest sample of Bolitoglossa species, specimens, and geographic localities studied to date. We performed phylogenetic analyses using parsimony with tree-alignment and maximum likelihood (ML) with similarity alignment, with indels as binary characters. Our optimal topologies were used to delimit lineages that we assigned to nominal species and candidate new species following criteria that maximize the consilience of the current species taxonomy, monophyly, gaps in branch lengths, genetic distances, and geographic distribution. We contrasted the results of our species-delimitation protocol with those of Automated Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) and multi-rate Poisson Tree Processes (mPTP). Finally, we inferred the historical biogeography of South American salamanders by dating the trees and using dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA). Our results revealed a clade including almost all Amazonian salamanders, with a topology incompatible with just the currently recognized nine species. Following our species-delimitation criteria, we identified 44 putative species in Amazonia. Both ABGD and mPTP inferred more species than currently recognized, but their numbers (23–49) and limits vary. Our biogeographic analysis suggested a stepping-stone colonization of the Amazonian lowlands from Central America through the Chocó and the Andes, with several late dispersals from Amazonia back into the Andes. These biogeographic events are temporally concordant with an early land bridge between Central and South America (~10–15 MYA) and major landscape changes in Amazonia during the late Miocene and Pliocene, such as the drainage of the Pebas system, the establishment of the Amazon River, and the major orogeny of the northern Andes. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","In this article, we propose the use of a new simple Bayes classifier (SBND) that quickly learns a Markov limit of the class variable to a network structure that relates the class variables and said limit.

The applicability of our method is shown for a large-scale (11.0 km) and time-demanding (9.14 hr for the period 2002–2013) 2-D morphodynamic sediment transport model of the Lower River Salzach and for three most sensitive input parameters (critical Shields parameter, grain roughness, and grain size distribution). Since Bayesian methods require a significant number of simulation runs, this work proposes to construct a surrogate model, here with the arbitrary polynomial chaos technique. The surrogate model is constructed from a limited set of runs (n=20) of the full complex sediment transport model. Then, Monte Carlo-based techniques for Bayesian calibration are used with the surrogate model (105 realizations in 4 hr). The results demonstrate that following Bayesian principles and iterative Bayesian updating of the surrogate model (10 iterations) enables to identify the most probable ranges of the three calibration parameters. Model verification based on the maximum a posteriori parameter combination indicates that the surrogate model accurately replicates the morphodynamic behavior of the sediment transport model for both calibration (RMSE = 0.31 m) and validation (RMSE = 0.42 m). Furthermore, it is shown that the surrogate model is highly effective in lowering the total computational time for Bayesian calibration, validation, and uncertainty analysis. As a whole, this provides more realistic calibration and validation of morphodynamic sediment transport models with quantified uncertainty in less time compared to conventional calibration procedures. ©2020.

We compare how this literature addresses causation, evaluation, instrumentation, and intervention, based on different methodologies. Then, we explain how the realist approach can contribute to theory-based evaluation with multi-methods. We go through the process leading from the adoption of policy aims to the production of a policy outcome by a causal mechanism linking agenda setting to policy formulation, cross-sectorial coordination, political interplays, and this policy’s outcome. This hypothesis is then tested against a typology of policy instruments classified by the State resources. These instruments are hereby treated as expected empirical observations that provide an empirical basis to assess the theoretical process following a Bayesian logic. We eventually present a five-step protocol aimed at making realist policy evaluation easier, which includes process theorization and operationalization, empirical tests design, case selection and justification, congruence analysis, and deep within-case study. © The Author(s) 2020.","Oceanic islands constitute natural laboratories to study plant speciation and biogeographic patterns of island endemics. Juan Fernandez is a southern Pacific archipelago consisting of three small oceanic islands located 600–700 km west of the Chilean coastline. Exposed to current cold seasonal oceanic climate, these 5.8–1 Ma old islands harbor a remarkable endemic flora. All known Fernandezian endemic grass species belong to two genera, Megalachne and Podophorus, of uncertain taxonomic adscription. Classical and modern classifications have placed them either in Bromeae (Bromus), Duthieinae, Aveneae/Poeae, or Loliinae (fine-leaved Festuca); however, none of them have clarified their evolutionary relationships with respect to their closest Festuca relatives. Megalachne includes four species, which are endemic to Masatierra (Robinson Crusoe island) (M. berteroniana and M. robinsoniana) and to Masafuera (Alejandro Selkirk island) (M. masafuerana and M. dantonii). The monotypic Podophorus bromoides is a rare endemic species to Masatierra which is only known from its type locality and is currently considered extinct. We have used museomic approaches to uncover the challenging evolutionary history of these endemic grasses and to infer the divergence and dispersal patterns from their ancestors. Genome skimming data were produced from herbarium samples of M. berteroniana and M. masafuerana, and the 164 years old type specimen of P. bromoides, as well as for a collection of 33 species representing the main broad- and fine-leaved Loliinae lineages. Paired-end reads were successfully mapped to plastomes and nuclear ribosomal cistrons of reference Festuca species and used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees. Filtered ITS and trnTLF sequences from these genomes were further combined with our large Loliinae data sets for accurate biogeographic reconstruction. Nuclear and plastome data recovered a strongly supported fine-leaved Fernandezian clade where Podophorus was resolved as sister to Megalachne. Bayesian divergence dating and dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis range evolution analyses estimated the split of the Fernandezian clade from its ancestral southern American Pampas-Ventanian Loliinae lineage in the Miocene-Pliocene transition, following a long distance dispersal from the continent to the uplifted volcanic palaeo-island of Santa Clara-Masatierra. Consecutive Pliocene-Pleistocene splits and a Masatierra-to-Masafuera dispersal paved the way for in situ speciation of Podophorus and Megalachne taxa. © Copyright © 2020 Moreno-Aguilar, Arnelas, Sánchez-Rodríguez, Viruel and Catalán.","The Bemisia tabaci complex in Ecuador was studied with respect to phylogenetic relationships and eco-geographical distribution. Whitefly samples were collected from natural and agricultural environments in nine provinces of Ecuador (latitude, 2° N–5° S; longitude, 78°–81° W). Mitotypes were identified based on phylogenetic analysis of the 3′-mtCOI-tRNAleu region (832 bp) and corrected pairwise distance analysis. The distribution of mitotypes was modeled using MaxEnt, and their predicted niches were characterized according to environmental gradients. Four B. tabaci mitotypes were identified, of which three are endemic, herein ECU1–3, and the other is the introduced B mitotype. Mitotypes ECU1 (44%), ECU2 (0.74%), and ECU3 (1.47%) grouped in the American Tropics (AMTROP) species and diverged by as much as 10%, which was higher than previous estimates for the AMTROP clade of 7–8.6%. Although haplotypes of ECU1 and ECU2 are known from the American Tropics, this is the first report of the ECU3 mitotype, which may possibly be restricted to southern Ecuador. The distribution of the three ECU-endemic mitotypes spanned the high-altitude niches of the western slope of the Andes, rich in microclimates with variable temperature and humidity conditions. The non-endemic B mitotype (47%) occurred only in the irrigated cropping systems located in hot and/or dry-tropical ecological niches. Of the endemic mitotypes, ECU1 occupied the most ecological niches. Among variables contributing to ECU1 and B mitotype niche range assignments, the most significant to influence ecological range was rainfall. The B. tabaci endemic to Ecuador were more diverse with respect to mtCOI-tRNAleu sequence than previously known, and occupied distinct microclimate niches suggestive of ecological resilience. © 2020 The Authors.","There is a great need to understand how resource interactions alter the functioning of ecosystems, where the selective elimination of pelagic fishes can lead to changes in food web structure. This work analyzes the trophic niches of three species of commercial importance in the Galapagos Marine Reserve, yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares (TA), skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis (KP), and wahoo, Acanthocybium solandri (AS), via multiple analyses. According to the prey-specific index of relative importance, the most important prey for TA was Dosidicus gigas, while for AS it was unidentified pelagic fish. Interspecific differences were found between the isotopic signatures of AS and those of TA and KP. The isotope mixing model provides evidence for some predominance of D. gigas in the diets of TA and KP, while the fishes Selar crumenophthalmus and Paranthias colonus contribute to the diet of AS. The stable isotope Bayesian ellipses show a high overlap between TA and KP, suggesting a similar use of resources and feeding areas, while the ellipse of AS does not overlap with that of the other species. Both AS and TA were present around the islands more commonly during the day, with a peak in detections in the morning for AS and a greater presence of TA throughout the afternoon; there were only a few detections of KP in the days immediately after tagging.

Phylodynamic analyses performed using the coat protein gene of SCMoV isolates from sunflower and weeds dated the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) back to 1887 (HPD95% = 1572–1971), which coincides with the dates of sunflower introduction in Argentina. The MRCA was located in the south of Buenos Aires province and was associated with sunflower host (posterior probability for the ancestral host, ppah = 0.98). The Bayesian phylodynamic analyses revealed the dispersal patterns of SCMoV, suggesting a link between natural host diversity, crop displacement by human activities and virus spread. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","This article presents a comprehensive study of human physiology to determine the impact of body mass index (BMI) on human gait. The approach followed in this study consists of a mathematical model based on the centre of mass of the human body, the inertia of a person in motion and the human gait speed. Moreover, the study includes the representation of a building using graph theory and emulates the presence of a person inside the building when an emergency takes place. The optimal evacuation route is obtained using the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, and the evacuation time prediction is calculated using a Gaussian process model. Then, the risk of the building is quantified by using a non-sequential Monte Carlo simulation. The results open up a new horizon for developing a more realistic model for the assessment of civil safety. © 2020 by the authors.

For that, the MTI processor of the Skyguard radar system of the Ecuadorian Army is simulated. In addition, the comparison of the Receiver Operational Curves (ROC) of the traditional processor with those of the adaptive MTI processor that implements the Least Mean Square (LMS) and Kalman Random Walk algorithms is performed. © 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

Undiagnosed faults in the machinery's components produce a high rate of unplanned stoppage of production processes that can even result in catastrophic consequences. Fault diagnosis in reciprocating compressors requires complex and time-consuming feature-extraction processes because typical fault diagnosers cannot deal directly with raw signals. In this paper, we streamline the deep learning and optimization algorithms for effective fault diagnosis on these machines. The proposed approach iteratively trains a group of long short-term memory (LSTM) models from a time-series representation of the vibration signals collected from a compressor. The hyperparameter search is guided by a Bayesian approach bounding the search space in each iteration. Our approach is applied to diagnose failures in intake/discharge valves on double-stage machinery. The fault-recognition accuracy of the best model reaches 93% after statistical selection between a group of candidate models. Additionally, a comparison with classical approaches, state-of-the-art deep learning-based fault-diagnosis approaches, and the LSTM-based model shows a remarkable improvement in performance by using the proposed approach. © 2019","This paper presents a new hybrid strategy which allows the dynamic identification of AC/DC microgrids (MG) by using algorithms such as Auto-Regressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) and Petri Nets (PN). The proposed strategy demonstrated in this study serves to obtain a dynamic model of the DC MG in isolated or connected modes. Given the non-linear nature of the system under study, the methodology divides the whole system in a bank of linearized models at different stable operating points, coordinated by a PN state machine. The bank of models obtained in state space, together with an adequate selection of models, can capture and reflect the non-linear dynamic properties of the AD/DC MGs and the different systems that it composes. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been tested using the Matlab/Simulink simulation platform. © 2020 The Author(s)","Limited genetic data are currently available for three vectors of Chagas disease in Ecuador, Panstrongylus howardi, P. chinai, and P. rufotuberculatus. Previously regarded as mainly sylvatic, these species have been poorly studied. Recently, they have been more frequently reported in domiciles and peridomiciles and are now considered true secondary vectors of Chagas disease in a country where an estimated 200,000 people are infected by Trypanosoma cruzi, a causative agent of this disease. In order to fill this gap, we obtained DNA for sequencing from 53 insects belonging to these three species and mainly sampled from the two Ecuadorian provinces of Loja and Manabí. We used six mitochondrial loci (COI, COII, ND4, CytB, 16S, and 12S) and two nuclear ones (ITS2 and 18S). We interpreted the phylogenetic trees built with single and concatenated data through maximum likelihood, Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo, and maximum parsimony methods. We provide evidence that P. chinai and P. howardi are indeed two supported species closely related and derived from a common ancestor. Additionally, the phylogenetic position of P. rufotuberculatus was confirmed as being distant from P. chinai and P. howardi and clustered with Triatoma dimidiata, a species belonging to the Northern American Triatoma clade. © 2019","The phase spectrum is an important characteristic of earthquake motion. Although amplitude and phase spectrum is essential to simulate an earthquake motion, the arrival time of a wave component with frequency and the distribution width of the group delay time are related to the duration of the time history of the wave component, its modeling is much easier than direct modeling of phase spectrum. In this paper, a stochastic differential equation (SDE) was considered to simulate the group delay time (GDT) of earthquake ground motion. A brief review of probabilistic Bayesian methods (Monte Carlos Sequential Methods) to handle earthquake data is presented. A methodology based on recursive algorithms is proposed that allows estimating and predict the magnitudes of seismic events from the time, location and magnitude of the event past. To approximate the solution of the stochastic differential equation, the Euler-Maruyama and Milstein structures were defined. New approaches for collective analysis of the data and an engineering model for the source are discussed with a few numerical results. © 2019","We empirically analyze the determinants of private banking profitability in Ecuador for the period 2002−2017. We contribute to the growing literature in four ways. First, we propose a more robust measure to quantify technical efficiency by using a two stages DEA with a Fractional Response Model. Second, we propose to jointly use three competition – market power measures, in line with the new industrial organization approach, to improve the analysis of industry determinants, which has always been done assessing separately every market power measure. Third, we introduce two new factors that may influence banking profitability: regulatory/institutional variables and dollarization derived factors, to test how being a dollarized (with foreign currency) economy may affect banks’ profitability. Finally, to address the weakness coming from the dynamic form of the Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM), we perform an improved version of it by treating the capital as an endogenous variable and several micro-determinants as given. We also perform some robustness checks by using a Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) in order to identify a robust set of determinants. Our results show that capital ratio, lending rate, labor productivity, size, efficiency and assets composition are micro-stable determinants of banks ‘profitability. In addition, we found that market power is a strong determinant of Ecuadorians’ banks profitability. Regarding macroeconomic factors, we found that the GDP cycle, inflation and spread are determinants of banking profitability while the regulatory variables did not show any relation. Finally, our results show that dollarization derived factors have an effect on private banking profitability. © 2019 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","This chapter presents the realist approach that provided our analytical framework. It defines the causal mechanism of a policy outcome from a realist methodology, then it displays a method of cross-case comparison for policy design, including the case selection, and it unpacks the causal mechanism linking resource nationalism to a deficit of public accountability. Section 2 is dedicated to unpack the causal mechanism of a policy outcome in policy design. It starts with defining causality as necessity and causal mechanisms as causal forces, then it proceeds with optimizing case selection for small-n comparison. Section 3 explains how to conduct a cross-case comparison of this causal mechanism. It starts presenting the basics of set-theoretic research design, then it explains how the Bayesian logic of likelihood can be utilized to assess empirical evidence, and it proposes a template for comparative policy design. © 2020, The Author(s).","Engineering practice commonly requires the calibration of complex numerical models based on experimental data, which is typically carried-out as a trial and error process whose success is highly influenced by human errors. The Bayesian procedure is a robust methodology to solve this problem which also allows quantification of the uncertainties. However, this procedure requires the knowledge of a likelihood function, which sometimes is difficult to evaluate or directly impossible to obtain. For such cases, the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method is an efficient alternative to address the calibration of a complex numerical probabilistic model based on data. This paper presents the applicability of the ABC method using an efficient algorithm called ABC-SubSim for the calibration of a complex non-lineal mechanical model. A set of uncertain model parameters from a reinforced concrete column subjected to lateral cyclic loads, are indirectly inferred with quantified uncertainty with a low computational cost. These parameters are difficult to observe experimentally and are crucial to asses the structural vulnerability and safety under seismic loads. Results show that the proposed methodology reduces the uncertainty about the mechanical parameters and makes them learn from the data, hence making this algorithm useful for uncertainty management and safety assessment. Influence of axial load on reinforced concrete beam-column models is also discussed. Finally, the paper discusses further improvements required for the ABC-SubSim based on sensitivity analysis and numerical trials carried-out over the course of this research.

Realist process tracing is philosophically grounded in scientific realism, according to which causal explanations of the world are possible beyond non-observable but detectable forces. It focuses on the causal mechanism that explains how an event X triggers a process leading to an outcome Y. It aims at opening the black box of causation through deep within-case studies and small-N comparison. The template for using realist process tracing in comparative policy analysis includes: (1) the theorization and operationalization of a causal mechanism, (2) the selection of a typical case on the causal mechanism for theory-building or testing, (3) the design of empirical tests based on the expected observations for each part of the mechanism, (4) evidence gathering and assessment through Bayesian analysis, and (5) cross-case comparison with another typical or a deviant case for confirming or disconfirming evidence. The chapter concludes with a reflection on how realist process tracing serves policy learning by improving transparency and replicability. © B. Guy Peters and Guillaume Fontaine 2020.

Such a fact has naturally led the emergence of small and medium sized companies devoted to the production of quality roses in the Ecuadorian highlands, which intrinsically entails resource usage optimization. One of the first steps towards optimizing the use of resources is to forecast demand, since it enables a fair perspective of the future, in such a manner that the in-advance raw materials supply can be previewed against eventualities, resources usage can be properly planned, as well as the misuse can be avoided. Within this approach, the problem of forecasting the supply of roses was solved into two phases: the first phase consists of the macro-forecast of the total amount to be exported by the Ecuadorian flower sector by the year 2020, using multi-layer neural networks. In the second phase, the monthly demand for the main rose varieties offered by the study company was micro-forecasted by testing seven models. In addition, a Bayesian network model is designed, which takes into consideration macroeconomic aspects, the level of employability in Ecuador and weather-related aspects. This Bayesian network provided satisfactory results without the need for a large amount of historical data and at a low-computational cost. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","This document presents a comparison of demand forecasting methods, with the aim of improving demand forecasting and with it, the production planning system of Ecuadorian textile industry. These industries present problems in providing a reliable estimate of future demand due to recent changes in the Ecuadorian context. The impact on demand for textile products has been observed in variables such as sales prices and manufacturing costs, manufacturing gross domestic product and the unemployment rate. Being indicators that determine to a great extent, the quality and accuracy of the forecast, generating also, uncertainty scenarios. For this reason, the aim of this work is focused on the demand forecasting for textile products by comparing a set of classic methods such as ARIMA, STL Decomposition, Holt-Winters and machine learning, Artificial Neural Networks, Bayesian Networks, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, taking into consideration all the above mentioned, as an essential input for the production planning and sales of the textile industries. And as a support, when developing strategies for demand management and medium-term decision making of this sector under study. Finally, the effectiveness of the methods is demonstrated by comparing them with different indicators that evaluate the forecast error, with the Multi-layer Neural Networks having the best results with the least error and the best performance. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","In recent years Ecuador has suffered from the Zika virus. Geo-software and statistical software allowed the probabilistic identification of suitable ecological niche species, such as the vector Aedes aegypti, which is the leading cause of the Zika virus transmission, depending on the dependent and independent variables. These models require pre-weighted input, normalized, and rasterized inputs to continue the validation process to estimate their predictive performance through several statistics such as the confusion matrix or the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC). It resulted that the Maxent method has been with the higher predictive performance with a value of Area Under Curve (AUC) = 0.998, which describes the areas of Zika with a greater probability of the transmission vector resembling the actual distribution of the species as a function of the presence data and the predictor variables. A large part of the Ecuadorian coastal territory yielded a statistical-based, probabilistic presence of the vector, being the most vulnerable before a possible epidemiological risk. © 2020 Revista Bionatura.

A statistical post-processing is compulsory in order to improve the output from the physical model and to improve the weather forecast in the city. A neural network can be applied in order to carry out this task but it is necessary first to reduce its uncertainty. The Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) have been studied deeply thanks to its probability analysis, the uncertainty can be approximated. In this paper an analysis founded on the adjustment of the posterior predictive distribution based on estimators is carried out in order to reduce the prediction error variation (implicitly the uncertainty) in a Short-Term Weather Forecast for the Andean city of Quito. From the analysis it is obtained a maximum error forecast of 12% and it is proven that for Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) structures, the variation of the error reduces almost to the half with weight-decays of (formula presented) and (formula presented). © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","The success of a company depends on its ability to build and maintain long-term relationships with its most valuable buyers. Ecuadorian companies face the challenge of identifying, differentiating and segmenting their clients. In response to this need, this study seeks to identify an unconventional form of segmentation based on the expected monetary value of customer billing in the retail sector. To this end, a probabilistic model was implemented that is derived from the Pareto/NBD methodology with a Bayesian hierarchy approach to estimate the customer value (CLV), based on a RFM data structure that considers the recency, frequency and monetary value of customers. After the estimate, the respective segmentation of customers was made where 24% of them were found to generate 68% of sales, therefore, three-quarters of customers are considered unprofitable. This research proposes a more efficient segmentation alternative based on customer value in the context of a retail company. © 2020 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

In this area, the species that inhabit the intertidal zone have been subject to few studies. One of the species inhabiting these areas is the clingfish Gobiesox adustus (Gobiesocidae). Objective: To analyze for the first time the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) of G. adustus’ population from Isla del Coco and compare it with those of continental coast of Costa Rica and Ecuador. Methods: We constructed a haplotype network for these samples. Genetic diversity, distance and structure were calculated by several software. The historical demography of Isla del Coco samples was assessed with the method Bayesian skyline plot as implemented in BEAST2. Results: The samples segregate into three haplogroups: one consisting of the Isla del Coco samples, a second consisting of a subset of the Ecuador samples, and a third consisting of Costa Rica and the remaining Ecuador samples. The genetic distances between the three haplogroups range between 1.6% and 2.1% (uncorrected p-distance), and pairwise ΦST and AMOVA results between the three haplogroups show high and significant values. Conclusions: The Isla del Coco haplogroup showed a Pleistocene population growth, which agrees with demographic patterns found in other marine organisms. The history of isolation of the G. adustus population from Isla del Coco demonstrates the evolutionary independence of this population. © 2020, Universidad de Costa Rica.

The use of probabilistic graphic models in the field of education has been considered for this research. But the problem with these general learning procedures comes from the presence of a high number of variables that measure different aspects of the same concept. In this case, we have that all variables have some degree of dependence between them, without a true causal structure. Therefore, a new procedure is presented that makes a hierarchical grouping of the data while learning a joint probability distribution. We try to make a test for each case where the probability is measured in each model using propagation algorithms. Then, the probability logarithm is applied to each case and the results are added in each model to determine the best fit for the proposed one. The method is applied to the analysis of a data set of educational data: evaluation of students of the Quevedo State Technical University (Ecuador). © 2020 Universidad de La Habana.

Proper ERP detection contributes to widening the scope of use and, in general, improving functionality. The morphology and latency of ERPs are variable among subject sessions, which complicates their detection. Although variability is an intrinsic feature of neuronal activity, it can be addressed with novel views on ERP detection techniques. In this paper, we propose an agile method for characterizing and thus detecting variable ERPs, which keeps track of their temporal and spatial information through the continuous measurement of the area under the curve in ERP components. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed ERP characterization for electrode selection in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and compare the results with other standard methods. We assess ERP classification for BCI use with Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) and cross-validation. We also evaluate performance with both the information transfer rate and BCI utility. The results of our validation tests show that this characterization helps to take advantage of the information on the evolution of positive and negative ERP components and, therefore, to efficiently select electrodes for optimized ERP detection. The proposed method improves the classification accuracy and bitrate of all sets of electrodes analyzed. Furthermore, the method is robust between different day sessions. Our work contributes to the efficient detection of ERPs, manages inter- and intrasubject variability, decreases the computational cost of classic detection methods and contributes to promoting low-cost personalized brain-computer interfaces. © 2013 IEEE.","Generating a clinical diagnosis of a mental disorder is a complex process due to the variety of biological factors that affect this type of condition, so it is necessary that a professional performs a deep evaluation in order to identify and determine the type of disorder that affects the patient. This paper proposes the implementation and comparison of five machine learning algorithms (ML) to generate automatic diagnoses of mental disorders, through the set of symptoms present in a patient. The algorithms selected for comparison are: Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Bayesian Networks, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). The evaluation metrics used on the benchmarked were precision, accuracy, recall, error rate and also we analyzed the ROC curves and the AUC values. The general results show that the Logistic Regression algorithm obtained a better performance with 70.82% of accuracy. The Support Vector Machine model, on the other hand, showed a low performance reaching only 42.99% accuracy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Introduction: The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG), a fundamental ecology pattern for higher organisms, has explained the increase of species diversity from the poles towards the tropics. Can we explain the biodiversity of Papillomaviruses based on this pattern? Objective: To analyse the phylogenetic diversity and phylogeography of most known genotypes and species belonging to Papillomaviridae Family isolated and molecularly characterized by distant latitudinal locations around the world. Methods: We collected 238 gene sequences encoding for the L1 and L2 viral capsid proteins from PaVE database. A geographical heat map based on the PV locations allowed to analyse the distribution and the number of PV species per country. Subsequently, a phylogenetic tree based on concatenated amino acid sequences L1 and L2 was constructed using a combination of Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods with Geneious version 11.2.1 and BEAST version 1.8.4. Statistical analysis with Principal Coordinate Analyses (PCA) using the Jaccard similarity index for presenceabsence were carried out to test the similarity of the groups in the phylogenetic tree based on their viral species, the host and origin country lists. Distance-based redundancy analysis generated an ordination plot of the similarity of viral species list per group of the phylogenetic tree vs. host species per group, the country list per group and the number of samples per group. Finally, the significance of each model was tested by Analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: A clear tendency of most of the papillomavirus (PV) species clustering in the Northern regions appeared. Our phylogenetic analyses largely support the taxonomic division into major papillomavirus genera (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Xi, Upsilon and Chi papillomaviruses), as reported in previous studies. Chelonid PV’s, a papillomavirus in turtles, appeared as the oldest group for all papillomaviruses. Minor inconsistencies were found within some of the major taxonomic groups explained by the exhausted phylogenetic analyses. Due to the different sampling data efforts with little replication in certain groups, hosts and countries, numerical models did not fit to the proposed hypothesis. Conclusions: Phylogeographical analysis allowed determining the global distribution of papillomaviruses species diversity per latitudinal location. As most of the papillomavirus (PV) species were clustered in the Northern regions, this may clearly represent a statistical bias because larger efforts in PV studies have historically been done in the US and Europe. The biogeographical trend of a latitudinal diversity gradient does not apply for papillomaviruses. Even though no support to the phylogeographical pattern of LDG for PV was obtained, our results may only be the product of a socio-economicalscientific artefact and not a natural phenomenon. © 2020, Universidad de Costa Rica.

Unfortunately, it usually happens that small but random quantities of the product get lost, stolen or broken without record as time passes, e.g., as a consequence of shoplifting. This is usual for retailers handling large varieties of inexpensive products, e.g., grocery stores. In turn, over time these discrepancies lead to stock freezing problems (see Ref. [1]), i.e., situations where the system believes the stock is above the re-order point but the actual stock is at zero, and so no replenishments or sales occur. Motivated by these issues, we model the interaction between sales, losses, replenishments and inventory levels as a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), where the inventory levels are unobserved (i.e., hidden) variables we wish to estimate. We present an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of the sale and loss distributions, which relies on solving a one-dimensional dynamic program for the E-step and on solving two separate one-dimensional nonlinear programs for the M-step. © 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

Assisting a subject during face recall by suggesting candidate faces can be challenging. One of the reasons is that the search space-the face space-is quite large and lacks structure. A commercial application of face recall is facial composite systems-such as Identikit, PhotoFIT, and CD-FIT-where a witness searches for an image of a face that resembles his memory of a particular offender. The inherent uncertainty and cost in the evaluation of the objective function, the large size and lack of structure of the search space, and the unavailability of the gradient concept makes this problem inappropriate for traditional optimization methods. In this paper we propose a novel evolutionary approach for searching the face space that can be used as a facial composite system. The approach is inspired by methods of Bayesian optimization and differs from other applications in the use of the skew-normal distribution as its acquisition function. This choice of acquisition function provides greater granularity, with regularized, conservative, and realistic results. © 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

In this paper is proposed two statistical models based on a system of stochastic differential equations (SDE) that model the dynamics of population growth, and three computational algorithms that allow the generation of probability distribution samples in high dimensions, in models that have non-linear structures and that are useful for making inferences. The algorithms allow to estimate simultaneously states solutions and parameters in SDE models. The interpretation of the parameters is important because they are related to the variables of growth, mortality, migration, physical-chemical conditions of the environment, among other factors. The algorithms are illustrated using real data from a sector of the population of the Republic of Ecuador, and are compared with the results obtained with the models used by theWorld Bank for the same data, which shows that stochastic models Proposals based on an SDE more adequately and reliably adjust the dynamics of demographic randomness, sampling errors and environmental randomness in comparison with the deterministic models used by the World Bank. It is observed that the population grows year by year and seems to have a definite tendency; that is, a clearly growing behavior is seen. To measure the relative success of the algorithms, the relative error was estimated, obtaining small percentage errors. © 2020 International Academic Press.","Transparency International estimates that the costs of corruption in public procurement reach between 20 and 25% of the contract value, sometimes reaching 40–50%.

The purpose is to obtain an early classifier that identifies Alzheimer’s disease, and thus contribute to improving the patient’s quality of life by applying appropriate therapies derived from early diagnosis. This work has the title of Second Round because it is the continuation of our previous results. Objective: To work with free conversations, to detect if polarity and tonality can be used to classify the phrases of those conversations and differentiate patients with Alzheimer’s. Methodology: Data from Charlotte and free interviews of patients with Alzheimer’s were used to calculate their correlation and thus determine the disconnection between the variables and the classification of Alzheimer’s patients. Results: 407 phrases from Charlotte and 432 phrases from Alzheimer’s were used in this study. A negative correlation showed the disconnection of the variables. It was more evident in Alzheimer’s than in Charlotte. The Bayes Net algorithm managed to classify Alzheimer’s with 84% F measure while J48 achieved 76% of this measure, with a Cross validation of 10 Folds, confirming our proposals described in previous works, for different conversations in this new study. Obtaining the mechanisms for the identification of Alzheimer’s disease is an object of analysis by many researchers. The point is to obtain an early classifier that identifies Alzheimer’s disease, to help improve the quality of life of patients and their families, by applying the appropriate therapies derived from early diagnosis. This work has the title of Second Round because it is the continuity of our previous results.

Aiming at the reliability in product quality, a model based on rough set and Bayesian network (RS-BN) is proposed in this paper. Simplify expert knowledge and reduce product quality factors using rough set theory, and the minimal product quality rules can be obtained. Then the Bayesian network is constructed and trained by the minimum rules. Based on the minimal rules, the complexity of Bayesian network structure and the difficulties of product reliability analysis are largely decreased. To verify the performance of the proposed RS-BN model, a competition dataset is utilized and four evaluation indicators are investigated, i.e., accuracy, F1-score, recall, and precision. Experimental results indicated that the proposed model is superior to the other three comparative models. © 2020 Totem Publisher, Inc.","Ecuador is regarded as being a mega-diverse country despite its limited land surface; it is home to around 602 amphibian species, of which 256 are endemic. However, Ecuador is also one of the countries that has a large number of endangered species, one of genus Pristimantis. Pristimantipopulation decline is attributed to synergy factors, such as pathogen outbreaks, habitat loss and climate change. The aim of this study is to generate potential distribution models for six Andean species belonging to the Pristimantis genus under different climate change scenarios. Potential distribution models were performed with bioclimatic variables together with each species records based on MaxEnt Entropy Models. The models’ quality was evaluated by AUC values, and the last step was the identification of highly responsive areas resulting in the most relevant to the preservation of the species included in this study. Categorization of MaxEnt research models are as follows: “Satisfactory” or “Excellent”. Predicted areas for the six species comply with suitable requirements for their subsistence. Potential future distribution shows the negative effects of climate change to include RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 environments, except for P. festae, which has a higher distribution area of 5.3% within RCP 4.5 and 6.3% at RCP 8.5. Protected areas partially contribute to species preservation, although 92% of P. cryophilius and 80% of P. festae specimens recorded were found within protected areas. © This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply 2020.","Reliable precipitation predictions require an understanding of climate teleconnections over precipitation. In Ecuador, these teleconnections were studied with correlation methods, but multivariate studies with several climatic indexes simultaneously has been less study. The objective of this work is to carry out a multivariate study using Bayesian networks to identify the influence of climate indexes in homogenous precipitation regions in Ecuador. The climate teleconnections, defined as the correlation between precipitation satellite data and climate indexes, as well as the regionalization of seasonality of precipitation were used to learn a Bayesian network in R software. It was characterized the structure and strength of the relationship between the teleconnections and the precipitation. Additionally, three types of belief propagation were used: regions to climate index, climate index to regions, and interactions between indexes. This was useful to determine whether the influence of a climate index is homogeneous throughout the country or varies by region, as well as to identify interactions between different indexes. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of precipitation in Ecuador, and to promote making evidence-based water resource decisions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","The ratio of building permits to population is a key indicator to evaluate land consumption. However, few researchers focus on land consumption and its environmental spillovers, for developing countries. The aim of our study, using a Bayesian comparison approach applied to a spatial panel, is to analyse the existence of an inverted U-shaped curve relationship between land consumption and economic development, namely the environmental Kuznets curve, with data that ranges from 2007 to 2015 for 221 cantons in Ecuador. The Bayesian comparison approach allows us to identify: i) the spatial weight matrix that best fits the data, and ii) the best spatial model according to the type of spatial spillovers (local or global). These are both of extreme interest because a knowledge of the extent to which the spatial spillovers spread over space, and their functional form, supports the planning of effective land use policies. The results do not support the inverted U-shaped hypothesis of the Kuznets curve. By contrast, the curvature is convex, which means higher levels of land consumption for higher levels of wealth. Spatial spillovers spread to a limited extent, highlighting an imitation game among agents, both institutions and private agents, in the neighbour locations. Policy implications go from the strengthening of the institutional framework and local tax management, to the urban regeneration to limit real estate speculation. All these interventions should be coordinated among neighbours to avoid freeriding behaviours. © 2019 The Author(s)","The interaction of the user with visual impairment with assistive technologies, and in particular with screen readers, generates a group of actions and events during their navigation.

Understanding user behavior by analyzing their interaction with applications, in addition, details the characteristics, relationships, structures and functions of the sequence of actions in a specific application domain. The objective of this document is to find activity patterns from a set of commands used by the user, combining data mining and a Bayesian model. This model calculates the probability of the functions used with the screen reader and generates a behavior profile to improve the user experience. For this study, the screen reader JAWS version 2018, the Open Journal Systems platform version 3.0.1 and a computer with Windows 10 operating system were used. During the first phase, command history used by the user by interacting with the Open Journal Systems platform were collected. The result is that the accessibility of users with visual impairment to interact with the computer and its applications has been improved by applying this model. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","The availability of large tracer data sets opened up the opportunity to investigate multiple source contributions to a mixture. However, the source contributions may be uncertain and, apart from Bayesian approaches, to date there are only solid methods to estimate such uncertainties for two and three sources. We introduce an alternative uncertainty estimation method for four sources based on multiple tracers as input data. Taylor series approximation is used to solve the set of linear mass balance equations. We illustrate the method to compute individual uncertainties in the calculation of source contributions to a mixture, with an example from hydrology, using a 14-tracer set from water sources and streamflow from a tropical, high-elevation catchment. Moreover, this method has the potential to be generalized to any number of tracers across a range of disciplines. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

We propose a mathematical model, knowing the direct flows and destinations of passengers and the route matrix. We solve the system applying Bayesian inference, using the Monte Carlo technique which generates a large number of random samples that are accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis-Hasting criterion. The resulting value is the arithmetic mean value of all accepted samples. We validate the model through the analysis of the convergence of results, patterns of behavior of the origin-destination pairs and the sensitivity of the results to variations in the values of the links and destinations. Finally, we apply it to the South-East corridor network of Quito city, as particular case study. © 2019 IEEE.","In this article, a new algorithm is developed for the identification of an AC/DC Microgrid (MG) using methods of 'Auto-Regressive with eXogenous inputs (ARX)' and Petri Nets (PN). An algorithm is shown in order to obtain a model of Distributed Generation (DG) systems for a MG. This algorithm aims to obtain a bank of models in which each model is obtained through the identification of a different point of operation. This method facilitates the identification of dynamic non-linear systems associated with MG systems. During the development of this research, a bank of models for converter systems are obtained in state space which reflect the nonlinear dynamic properties of the systems and converters that compose an AC/DC MG. © 2019 IEEE.","Air pollution is one of the greatest risks for the health of people. In recent years, platforms based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for the monitoring of pollution in the air have been studied to deal with this problem, due to several advantages, such as low-costs, security, multitask and ease of deployment. However, due to the limitations in the flying time of the UAVs, these platforms could perform monitoring tasks poorly if the mission is not executed with an adequate strategy and algorithm. Their application can be improved if the UAVs have the ability to perform autonomous monitoring of the areas with a high concentration of the pollutant, or even to locate the pollutant source. This work proposes an algorithm to locate an air pollutant's source by using a UAV. The algorithm has two components: (i) a metaheuristic technique is used to trace the increasing gradient of the pollutant concentration, and (ii) a probabilistic component complements the method by concentrating the search in the most promising areas in the targeted environment. The metaheuristic technique has been selected from a simulation-based comparative analysis between some classical techniques. The probabilistic component uses the Bayesian methodology to build and update a probability map of the pollutant source location, with each new sensor information available, while the UAV navigates in the environment. The proposed solution was tested experimentally with a real quadrotor navigating in a virtual polluted environment. The results show the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm. © 2019 by the authors.","We propose a second–order total generalized variation (TGV) regularization for the reconstruction of the initial condition in variational data assimilation problems. After showing the equivalence between TGV-regularization and a Bayesian MAP estimator, we focus on the detailed study of the inviscid Burgers’ data assimilation problem. Due to the difficult structure of the governing hyperbolic conservation law, we consider a discretize–then–optimize approach and rigorously derive a first–order optimality condition for the problem. For the numerical solution, we propose a globalized reduced Newton–type method together with a polynomial line–search strategy, and prove convergence of the algorithm to stationary points. The paper finishes with some numerical experiments where, among others, the performance of TGV-regularization compared to TV-regularization is tested. © 2019 AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES.","Amphimerus Barker, 1911 is a liver fluke infecting several animal species and humans. Being a digenetic trematode of the Opisthorchiidae family, Amphimerus is closely related to the genera Metorchis, Clonorchis and Opisthorchis. Recently, a high prevalence of Amphimerus infection in humans, cats, and dogs had been demonstrated in a tropical Pacific region of Ecuador. Hence, we determined and characterized the entire mt genome sequences of adult liver flukes, morphologically identified as Amphimerus, collected in the endemic region of Ecuador, and examined its phylogenetic relationships with flukes in the Opisthorchiidae family using Bayesian inference (BI) based on the concatenated amino acid sequences and partial cox1 sequences. The complete mt genome sequence (15, 151 bp in length) of the Amphimerus sp. contains 35 genes, including 12 protein-coding genes (PCGs, without atp8), two rRNAs (rrnL and rrnS) and 21 tRNAs, lacking trnG. The gene content and arrangement of the Ecuadorian Amphimerus mt genome was similar to those of other trematodes in the Opisthorchiidae family. All genes in the circular mt genome of Amphimerus sp. are transcribed from the same strand in one direction, with the A + T content of 60.77%. Genetic distances between Amphimerus sp. and other genera in Opisthorchiidae were rather high, ranging from 26.86% to 28.75% at nucleotide level and 29.37%–31.12% at amino acid level. Phylogenetic analysis placed the Ecuadorian Amphimerus within the branch of Opisthorchiidae, but very distinct from Opisthorchis. Our results indicate that the liver fluke Amphimerus from Ecuador does not belong to the genus Opisthorchis, and that it should be assigned under the genus Amphimerus. The determination of the mt genome of the Ecuadorian Amphimerus provides a new genetic resource for future studies on taxonomy and molecular epidemiology of Opisthorchiidae trematodes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","With just a handful of documented cases of hybridisation in cartilaginous fishes, shark hybridisation remains poorly investigated. Small amounts of admixture have been detected between Galapagos (Carcharhinus galapagensis) and dusky (Carcharhinus obscurus) sharks previously, generating a hypothesis of ongoing hybridisation. We sampled a large number of individuals from areas where the species co-occur (contact zones) across the Pacific Ocean and used both mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded SNPs to examine genetic admixture and introgression between the two species. Using empirical analytical approaches and simulations, we first developed a set of 1873 highly informative SNPs for these two species to evaluate the degree of admixture between them. Overall, results indicate a high discriminatory power of nuclear SNPs (F ST = 0.47, p < 0.05) between the two species, unlike mitochondrial DNA (Φ ST = 0.00 p > 0.05), which failed to differentiate these species. We identified four hybrid individuals (∼1%) and detected bi-directional introgression between C. galapagensis and C. obscurus in the Gulf of California along the east Pacific coast of the Americas. We emphasize the importance of including a combination of mtDNA and diagnostic nuclear markers to properly assess species identification, detect patterns of hybridisation, and better inform management and conservation of these sharks, especially given the morphological similarities within the genus Carcharhinus. © 2019","Dengue fever, a vector-borne disease, represents a priority public health problem in Ecuador. Previous studies indicated that the ecology of the transmitter vector (Aedes aegypti) is influenced by environmental parameters and human behavior; however, the effects of those variables on mosquito population dynamics depend on local environmental features. In this study, we identified the most important factors influencing the risk of dengue virus infection in Ecuador. The maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) was used to determine the areas with a high probability of the presence of Aedes aegypti under current and future (2050) climatic conditions, using the location of reported dengue cases and potential environmental factors. The model performance was quantified based on an accuracy assessment. Additionally, we used meteorological data from the study period in a partial least square regression (PLS-R) to predict the number of total dengue cases (TDC) and then estimated the future number of cases using the equation obtained with the PLS-R. Population density, elevation, and mean temperatures of the warmest and wettest quarters were found to be the most important variables influencing the mosquito's geographical distribution. Maximum temperature and minimum temperature were the climatic factors with the best projecting capacity in predicting the TDC in the Ecuadorian coast region. The results show a greater mosquito presence probability in populated areas, with a considerable expansion of suitable habitat across the central and southern provinces by 2050. The temporal analysis revealed that the regional dengue outbreak season goes from March to June, and the future estimation predicted that the next large outbreak would occur in 2018. These results present a good intel for solutions of reduction of dengue cases in the country. This further will allow the responsible authorities to pinpoint proper vector control measurements by province. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Gears are key elements in mechanical transmission systems. Fault diagnosis in gearboxes is a cutting-edge topic nowadays mainly addressed by machine learning approaches. The success classifying a fault under this approach depends directly on the quality of the information provided to the models, and in gearboxes, quality of captured information depends on the place where a sensor is located. In this work, we propose a deep learning approach for the evaluation of the best of two accelerometers positions for classifying nine severity levels in gearboxes. Based on the performance of LSTM models whose hyperparameters have been found by a Bayesian optimization, we show which one is the best source of information for this layout. Also, we have performed statistical comparisons in order to find any statistical differences between models and accelerometers. © 2019 IEEE.","A major emerging challenge to resolution of a stable phylogenetic Tree of Life has been incongruent inference among studies. Given the increasing ubiquity of incongruent studies, analyzing the predicted phylogenetic utility and quantitative evidence regarding contributions toward resolution of commonly-used markers in historical studies over the last decade represents an important, yet neglected, component of phylogenetics. Here we examine the phylogenetic utility of two sets of commonly-used legacy markers for understanding the evolutionary relationships among goodeines, a group of viviparous freshwater fishes endemic to central Mexico. Our analyses reveal that the validity of existing inferences is compromised by both lack of information and substantially biased patterns of nucleotide substitution. Our analyses demonstrate that many of the evolutionary relationships of goodeines remain uncertain – despite over a century of work. Our results provide an updated baseline of critically needed areas of investigation for the group and underscore the importance of quantifying phylogenetic information content as a fundamental step towards eroding false confidence in results based on weak and biased evidence. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Species delimitation is a major quest in biology and is essential for adequate management of the organismal diversity. A challenging example comprises the fish species of red snappers in the Western Atlantic. Red snappers have been traditionally recognized as two separate species based on morphology: Lutjanus campechanus (northern red snapper) and L. purpureus (southern red snapper). Recent genetic studies using mitochondrial markers, however, failed to delineate these nominal species, leading to the current lumping of the northern and southern populations into a single species (L. campechanus). This decision carries broad implications for conservation and management as red snappers have been commercially over-exploited across the Western Atlantic and are currently listed as vulnerable. To address this conflict, we examine genome-wide data collected throughout the range of the two species. Population genomics, phylogenetic and coalescent analyses favour the existence of two independent evolutionary lineages, a result that confirms the morphology-based delimitation scenario in agreement with conventional taxonomy. Despite finding evidence of introgression in geographically neighbouring populations in northern South America, our genomic analyses strongly support isolation and differentiation of these species, suggesting that the northern and southern red snappers should be treated as distinct taxonomic entities. © 2019 The Author(s).","We report the successful computational reliability of integrating renewable energy into conventional electric power systems. According to renewable resources available in the province of Imbabura in Ecuador, where there are sufficient renewable resources to generate clean energy with three types of technology, such as wind energy, photovoltaic solar energy and thermoelectric energy. We have been able to conduct two fundamental case studies, and then calculate reliability indices using the non-sequential Monte Carlo method using Matlab programming. The reliability indices allowed us to evaluate the reliability of the system. Due to the fact that the lower the reliability index, the higher the reliability of the system. As a result, this paper provides a promising method for increasing the reliability of electric power systems and supporting the future integration of renewable energies. © 2019, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

Yet, the determinants of spatial variation in trait matching remain largely unaddressed. Here, we generate a hypothesis that is based on the geographical distributions of species morphologies. To illustrate our hypothesis, as a study system we use hummingbirds in the tropical Andes. Hummingbirds with specialized morphologies (i.e., long or curved bills) may forage on flowers that are inaccessible to hummingbirds with generalized bill morphologies (i.e., small-to-medium-sized bills with no curvature), yet the vast majority of hummingbirds have generalized bill morphologies. Thus, we propose that trait matching across space is determined by the distribution of morphological specialists. In the Andes, we observe the richness of specialized hummingbird morphotypes to peak at high and low elevations. Therefore, we hypothesize that trait matching should be most influential in predicting pairwise interactions at high and low elevations. We illustrate our hypothesis by field observations along an elevational gradient in Podocarpus National Park (Ecuador). Using Bayesian hierarchical modeling of interaction frequencies in combination with network analyzes, we found that hummingbirds at high and low elevations contributed to resource partitioning by foraging on morphologically close-matching flowers. Moreover, at high and low elevations, hummingbirds with specialized morphologies showed a stronger tendency to visit close-matching flowers than morphological non-specialists did. In contrast, at mid-elevations, hummingbirds were not attracted to morphologically close-matching flowers. These results suggest that the spatial distribution of specialized morphotypes determines trait matching and the partitioning of interactions within hummingbird–plant communities.

Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences were used in Bayesian and Maximum likelihood analyses to generate a phylogenetic hypothesis for Apogon species. Bayesian inferences were used to date the cladogenetic events. Analyses with BioGeoBEARS were conducted to reconstruct the biogeographic history and ancestral ranges. The phylogenetic results show a monophyletic clade of TEP Apogon species with A. imberbis from the eastern Atlantic as sister species. The two lineages diverged during the Miocene. Within the TEP clade, two subclades diverged at around 11.1 million years ago (Mya): one clusters the coastal continental species (A. pacificus, A. retrosella and A. dovii), and the second clusters the oceanic island species (A. atradorsatus, A. atricaudus and A. guadalupensis). The estimated diversification times of these subclades were 9.8 and 7.1 Mya, respectively. Within each subclade, species divergences occurred during the Pliocene-Pleistocene epochs. The divergent event between the Atlantic A. imberbis and Apogon TEP clade corresponds to the first closure event of the Central American Seaway. The biogeographic history of Apogon within the TEP appears to be the result of vicariant, dispersal and founder events that occurred during the last 11 million years. The vicariant and dispersal events occurred along the mainland and were associated with the origin of the Central American Gap. The founder events could have allowed the invasion of Apogon to TEP island areas and could have been driven by ancient warming oceanic waters, changes in circulation of marine currents, and the presence of seamounts in ancient marine ridges that allowed the settlement of marine biota. These factors may have allowed Apogon lineages to cross the TEP biogeographic barriers at different times, with subsequent genetic isolation. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","The genus Paratrichodorus currently comprises 26 species of polyphagous ectoparasitic plant nematodes that are distributed worldwide and include a few tobravirus vector species. Paratrichodorus is one of the most difficult genera for species identification because it is phenotypically conserved, with morphometric characters that often overlap between species. From 2003 to 2016, nematode surveys were conducted in southern Spain, and the present study addresses 22 nematode populations of the Paratrichodorus hispanus group. Among them, two new species, Paratrichodorus almadenensis sp. nov. And Paratrichodorus ramblensis sp. nov., are described here morphologically and molecularly and compared with topotype specimens of Paratrichodorus hispanus. Furthermore, this analysis was complemented with the first molecular data for this species complex and for the genus Monotrichodorus. The phylogeny of family Trichodoridae showed the relationship of Monotrichodorus with Trichodorus, both of which are phylogenetically associated with the P. hispanus species group, including the two newly described species. Several phylogenetic hypotheses about the monophyly of the genera with molecular data composing the family Trichodoridae were tested using Shimodaira-Hasegawa and approximately unbiased tests. This work also includes the first observations of copulatory plugs in Paratrichodorus, which clearly differ from the different types of mating plugs described in Trichodorus species. © 2018 The Linnean Society of London.","In this work we propose a methodology based on sequential Monte Carlos techniques for the estimation of dynamic systems states arising from the torque and drag phenomena of a directional drill string. This methodology arises from the need to consider the various mechanical factors and the geological parameters that influence the drift deviation, which conduce to no vertical drilling and phenomena of torque and drag. The anticipated model will acquire importance for the evaluation with the different efforts for which it will be in the next stage of the drill string. The methodology is exposed through the reconstruction of states of the synthetic model states proposed by Johancsik, Friesen, and Dawson, using the Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), observing good adjustment of torsion and drag states estimated by the filters with respect to the real values. Filters performance was evaluated in terms of the mean square error, showing variability of the estimated errors 0.05 for EnKF and 0.01 for UKF and a fast execution of the algorithms 3.07 (seg) for EnKF and 0.48 (seg) for UKF. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","This paper proposes a new clustering method called Gustafson-Kessel with Focal Point (GKFP). The proposal aims at benefiting from the advantage of using Gustafson-Kessel clustering technique leveraged by the use of a Focal Point which enables obtaining partitions with different levels of granularity. Thus the method identifies clusters with uncorrelated or strongly correlated data while it allows the user to explore different regions of the feature space with different levels of detail. Due to the possibility of dealing with correlated data, a regularization procedure might be necessary. Therefore, the paper also briefly describes a Bayesian regularization which can be associated with GKFP. Experiments from bearing fault diagnosis show that GKFP outperforms three other clustering techniques, i.e., the popular fuzzy c-means (FCM), Gustafson-Kessel (GK), and the state of the art FCMFP, for two different bearing data sets. © 2018 IEEE.","The growth pattern of four commercial decapod crustacean species (Arenaeus cribrarius, Ucides cordatus, Palaemon longirostris and Plesionika izumiae) was reanalyzed using published data. Six candidate growth models with asymptotic and non-asymptotic characteristics were tested. The best model was determined by information theory, according to Bayesian (BIC) and Akaike (AICc) information criteria and the weight of evidence in favour of model i (Wi). For U. cordatus, P. izumiae and the females of A. cribrarius, the best growth model corresponded to case 1 of Schnute model. In male A. cribrarius, the highest Wi was observed for the case 1 of Schnute model according to both criteria, but seasonal models were also plausible to describe growth. In P. longirostris, discrepancies were observed between criteria. The BIC supported the case 1 of Schnute in females, but the AICc did not identify a winner model (Wi > 90%); the case 1 and case 4 of Schnute displayed the highest Wi. The males that exhibited the highest Wi values were Schnute case 4 > Schnute case 3 > von Bertalanffy > Gompertz > Logistic. This study highlights the importance of considering different assumptions in growth patterns of the species and does not impose any a priori mathematical framework to available data. Abbreviations: AIC: Akaike Information Criterion. BIC: Bayesian Information Criterion Impact Statement The multi-model approach improves the model selection based on information criteria to re-describe patterns of growth in some decapod crustaceans. The von Bertalanffy growth model is not appropriate to describe the growth pattern based on the available data. The growth patterns found were asymptotic and not asymptotic, described mainly through the Schnute model. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","In this work the methodology applied is based on Bayesian statistical methods inspired by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes, which simplifies the estimation and prediction process of the Markov switching model. The general objective of this study is to determine simultaneously: non-linearity, structural changes, asymmetries and outliers that are characteristics present in many financial series. The methodology is empirically illustrated using series that measure the annual growth rate of industrial production in the MERCOSUR countries. The sampling algorithm [1] is implemented to estimate the parameters of the model. The parameters were estimated in terms of expected values a posteriori and standard deviations a posteriori. Three criteria is used to assess the prediction model: square root of the mean quadratic error (RSME), the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test and the TRC statistical test. These measures of goodness-of-fit show, that the estimates have small errors. The execution time of the algorithm is calculated, observing high performance. As a result of the analysis of the data, it is concluded that there is no reduction of economic volatility and no reduction in the depth of economic cycles. At the breakpoints, atypical values and non-linearity in the data are observed. It also shows that there are no common economic cycles for the countries analyzed. © 2019 ASEPUMA.

To achieve this objective, new paradigms are necessary. The present work proposes the conception of an autonomic communication system, which is based on a Bayesian network and on an ontology, to take reconfiguration decisions in the system. The ontology provides the knowledge about the performance factors and their relationships in the communication networks, to configure the structure of the Bayesian network. The Bayesian network is the stochastic reasoning mechanism used by the decision-making system. We present several tests on the NS2 simulator, and we observe an improvement in the system performance, for scenarios with high reconfiguration requirements.

In the summer of 2015, unprecedented and massive mats of S. fluitans and S. natans have been observed throughout the Mexican Caribbean including exceptional accumulations ashore. This study uses stable isotopes to assess the impact of Sargassum blooms on the trophic dynamics of the Diadema antillarum sea urchin, a keystone herbivore on many Caribbean reefs. Bayesian models were used to estimate the variations in the relative proportions of carbon and nitrogen of assimilated algal resources. At three lagoon reef sites, the niche breadth of D. antillarum was analysed and compared under massive influx of drifting Sargassum spp. vs. no influx of Sargassum blooms. The effects of the leachates generated by the decomposition of Sargassum led to hypoxic conditions on these reefs and reduced the taxonomic diversity of macroalgal food sources available to D. antillarum. Our trophic data support the hypothesis that processes of assimilation of carbon and nitrogen were modified under Sargassum effect. Isotopic signatures of macroalgae associated with the reef sites exhibited significantly lower values of-15N altering the natural herbivory of D. antillarum. The Stable Isotopes Analysis in R (SIAR) indicated that, under the influence of Sargassum blooms, certain algal resources (Dictyota, Halimeda and Udotea) were more assimilated due to a reduction in available algal resources. Despite being an abundant available resource, pelagic Sargassum was a negligible contributor to sea urchin diet. The Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R (SIBER) analysis displayed differences between sites, and suggests a reduction in trophic niche breadth, particularly in a protected reef lagoon. Our findings reveal that Sargassum blooms caused changes in trophic characteristics of D. antillarum with a negative impact by hypoxic conditions. These dynamics, coupled with the increase in organic matter in an oligotrophic system could lead to reduce coral reef ecosystem function. © 2019 PeerJ Inc..

The aim of the present study was to estimate the true prevalence of brucellosis together with diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of three serological tests in humans of the northwestern part of Ecuador using a Bayesian approach adjusted for the dependencies among the multiple tests to avoid any misinterpretation. In addition, the causal agent responsible for human brucellosiswas also identified.Using a total of 3,733 samples collected from humans in this area between 2006 and 2008, the prevalence of human brucellosis and the diagnostic test characteristics of the Rose Bengal fast agglutination test (RBT), Wright's slow agglutination test with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt dehydrate (EDTA) (SAT-EDTA), and indirect ELISA (iELISA) were estimated using a Bayesian approach. The estimated true prevalence of human brucellosis was 1%(credibility interval: 0.4-1.6). The sensitivities of iELISA and RBT were higher than and similar (95.1%and 95.0%, respectively) to those of SAT-EDTA (60.8%). Even though all tests indicated a high specificity (> 99.0%), the specificity ofSAT-EDTAwas highest (99.9%).The circulatingstrain in this studyareawas identified to beBrucella abortus biotype 4 based on culture andmicrobiological characterization. The RBT and the iELISA are recommended for estimating the true prevalence of human brucellosis and/or for surveillance programs following their high sensitivities and specificities.

However, hazardous volcanic events can also occur during non-magmatic unrest, defined as a state of volcanic unrest in which no migration of magma is recognised. Examples include tectonic unrest, and hydrothermal unrest that may lead to phreatic eruptions. Recent events (e.g. Ontake eruption, September 2014) have demonstrated that the successful forecasting of phreatic eruptions is still very difficult. It is therefore of paramount importance to identify indicators that define the state of non-magmatic unrest. Often, this type of unrest is driven by fluids-on-the-move, requiring alternative monitoring setups, beyond the classical seismic-geodetic-geochemical architectures. Here we present a new version of the probabilistic model BET (Bayesian Event Tree), called BET_UNREST, specifically developed to include the forecasting of non-magmatic unrest and related hazards. The structure of BET_UNREST differs from the previous BET_EF (BET for Eruption Forecasting) by adding a dedicated branch to detail non-magmatic unrest outcomes. Probabilities are calculated at each node by merging prior models and past data with new incoming monitoring data, and the results can be updated any time new data has been collected. Monitoring data are weighted through pre-defined thresholds of anomaly, as in BET_EF. The BET_UNREST model is introduced here, together with its software implementation PyBetUnrest, with the aim of creating a user-friendly, open-access, and straightforward tool to support short-term volcanic forecasting (already available on the VHub platform). The BET_UNREST model and PyBetUnrest tool are tested through three case studies in the frame of the EU VUELCO project. © 2017, The Author(s).","Background: Conserving both biodiversity and ecosystem services is a major goal of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Hotspots for biodiversity in the Andes significantly overlap with areas with dense human populations that sustain their economy through agricultural production. Therefore, developing management forms that reconcile food provisioning services—such as agriculture—with biodiversity conservation must be addressed to avoid social conflicts and to improve conservation in areas where biodiversity co-occurs with other ecosystem services. Here, we present a high-resolution conservation plan for vascular plants and agriculture in the Ecuadorian Dry Inter-Andean Valleys (DIAV) hotspot. Trade-offs in conserving important areas for both biodiversity and agriculture were explored. Methods: We used a dataset containing 5,685 presence records for 95 plant species occurring in DIAVs, of which 14 species were endemic. We developed habitat suitability maps for the 95 species using Maxent. Prioritization analyses were carried out using a conservation planning framework. We developed three conservation scenarios that selected important areas for: biodiversity only, agriculture only, and for both biodiversity and agriculture combined. Results: Our conservation planning analyses, capture 33.5% of biodiversity and 11% of agriculture under a scenario solely focused on the conservation of biodiversity. On the other hand, the top 17% fraction of the agriculture only scenario captures 10% of biodiversity and 28% of agriculture. When biodiversity and agriculture were considered in combination, their representation varied according to the importance given to agriculture. The most balanced solution that gives a nearly equal representation of both biodiversity and agriculture, was obtained when agriculture was given a slightly higher importance over biodiversity during the selection process. Discussion: This is the first evaluation of trade-offs between important areas for biodiversity and agriculture in Ecuadorian DIAV. Our results showed that areas with high agricultural productivity and high biodiversity partly overlapped. Our study suggests that a land-sharing strategy would be appropriate for conserving plant diversity and agriculture in the DIAV. Overall, our study reinforces the idea that friendly practices in agriculture can contribute to biodiversity conservation. © 2019 Quintana et al.","We describe a new species of Lynchius from the eastern montane forest of southern Ecuador. We also report the occurrence of L. parkeri in Ecuador, on paramos of Yacuri National Park, near the border with Peru. We used morphological and genetic evidence for the description of the new species and the new report of L. parkeri. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference on DNA sequences for mitochondrial and nuclear genes. The phylogeny shows that L. simmonsi is sister to a clade composed of the remaining species of Lynchius and that the new species is sister to L. flavomaculatus. The new species has a prominent and heavily ossified head with noticeably spiculate cranial exostosis that easily distinguishes it from all its congeners. The dorsal region and limbs present several reduced subconical and rounded tubercles and pronounced dermal ridges on the dorsum. We also describe the osteology of the new species based on x-rays of the holotype. Only six species of Lynchius, two known to occur in Ecuador (L. flavomaculatus and L. simmonsi). The description of L. megacephalus sp. n. and new record of L. parkeri double the number of known Lynchius in Ecuador and suggest that the diversity of Ecuadorian and Peruvian Lynchius is still underestimated.

Despite the several therapeutic and economic advantages of this new paradigm, it is important to follow certain guidelines, in order to build a safe, useful, scalable, and ergonomic tool. This work proposes to address all these points, through the case study of a physical tele-rehabilitation platform for patients after hip replacement surgery. The scalability and versatility of the system is handled by the implementation of a modular architecture. The safeness and effectiveness of the tool is ensured by an artificial intelligence module that assesses the quality of the movements performed by the user. The usability of the application is evaluated by a cognitive walkthrough method. Results show that the system (i) is able to properly assess the correctness of the human’s motion through two possible methods (Dynamic Time Warping and Hidden Markov Model), and (ii) provides a good user experience. The discussion addresses (i) the advantages and disadvantages of the main approaches for a gesture recognition of therapeutic movements, and (ii) critical aspects to provide the patient with the best usability of a tele-rehabilitation platform. © 2019 by the authors.

Several causes can lead to this issue, the academic factor being a potential reason. The main objective of this research is to detect dropout patterns in the “Técnica del Norte” University (Ecuador), based on personal and academic historical data, using predictive classification techniques in data mining. The KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) process was used to determine desertion patterns focused on two approaches: (i) Bayesian, and (ii) Decision Trees, both implemented on Weka. The classifiers performance was quantitatively evaluated using the confusion matrix and quality metrics. The results proved that the technique based on decision trees had slightly better performance than the Bayesian approach on the processed data. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Researchers have showed that climatic, population, economic, and social characteristics contribute to the proliferation of Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue fever (DF) in Ecuador. In this study, we identified the factors with the greatest influence on dengue virus spread using a spatio-temporal analysis. We applied the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) to determine the spatial distribution of DF and identify areas with high probability of presence of A. aegypti by analyzing monthly climatic conditions, locations of reported dengue cases during 2012, and social factors in Guayaquil. Social variables showed greater influence on the presence and spread of disease during dengue outbreak season. The best model performance was obtained when the most important social variables were grouped based on components of the population's unsatisfied basic needs (UBN). Head of the household was a woman, the household was unoccupied, and UBN related to housing conditions at the household level were the most significant social risk factors. The final spatial distribution shows that the districts with the highest risks of infection are located mainly in the southern portion of the city, therefore these areas must take priority when integrated vector-control interventions and prevention protocols are carried out. © 2018","Habitat discontinuities, temperature gradients, upwelling systems, and ocean currents, gyres and fronts, can affect distributions of species with narrow environmental tolerance or motility and influence the dispersal of pelagic larvae, with effects ranging from the isolation of adjacent populations to connections between them. The coast of the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) is a highly dynamic environment, with various large gyres and upwelling systems, alternating currents and large rocky-habitat discontinuities, which may greatly influence the genetic connectivity of populations in different parts of the coast. Elacatinus puncticulatus is a cryptic, shallow-living goby that is distributed along the continental shore of virtually the entire TEP, which makes it a good model for testing the influence of these environmental characteristics in the molecular evolution of widespread species in this region. A multilocus phylogeny was used to evaluate the influence of habitat gaps, and oceanographic processes in the evolutionary history of E. puncticulatus throughout its geographical range in the TEP. Two well-supported allopatric clades (one with two allopatric subclades) were recovered, the geographic distribution of which does not correspond to any previously proposed major biogeographic provinces. These populations show strong genetic structure and substantial genetic distances between clades and sub-clades (cytb 0.8–7.3%), with divergence times between them ranging from 0.53 to 4.88 Mya, and recent population expansions dated at 170–130 Kya. The ancestral area of all populations appears to be the Gulf of Panama, while several isolation events have formed the phylogeographic patterns evident in this species. Local and regional oceanographic processes as well as habitat discontinuities have shaped the distribution patterns of the genetic lineages along the continental TEP. Large genetic distances, high genetic differentiation, and the results of species-tree and phylogenetic analyses indicate that E. puncticulatus comprises a complex of three allopatric species with an unusual geographic arrangement. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","This paper presents an extension of a state-space model for a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant in order to include water and steam properties stated by the International Association for Properties of Water and Steam Industrial Formulation 1997 (IAPWS IF-97). The CCGT thermal cycles were implemented using MATLAB XSTEAM IF-97 functions, which provide an accurate steam and water properties within the thermodynamic states model. This model can be used in academia and training environments to test and validate different types of control systems, or even serve as an input for state-estimation methods. Steady state results for this model have been obtained for a generic 20 MW CCGT power plant, as well as a 133 MW steam generation plant in Ecuador. The results reveal that the model provides accurate values for steam flow, temperatures, and power outputs; moreover, the calculated thermodynamic states correspond to actual measurements. © 2018 IEEE.","Here, we analyse changes throughout time in the isotopic niche of the Franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei), the South American fur seal (Arctocephalus australis) and the South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) from the Río de la Plata estuary and adjacent Atlantic Ocean to test the hypothesis that fishing may modify the diet of small-gape predators by reducing the average size of prey. The overall evidence, from stable isotope and stomach contents analyses, reveals major changes in resource partitioning between the three predators considered, mainly because of an increased access of Franciscana dolphins to juvenile demersal fishes. These results are consistent with the changes in the length distribution of demersal fish species resulting from fishing and suggest that Franciscana dolphin has been the most benefited species of the three marine mammal species considered because of its intermediate mouth gape. In conclusion, the impact of fishing on marine mammals goes beyond the simple reduction in prey biomass and is highly dependent on the mouth gape of the species involved. © 2018, The Author(s).","Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in ecology and conservation. Presence-only SDMs such as MaxEnt frequently use natural history collections (NHCs) as occurrence data, given their huge numbers and accessibility. NHCs are often spatially biased which may generate inaccuracies in SDMs. Here, we test how the distribution of NHCs and MaxEnt predictions relates to a spatial abundance model, based on a large plot dataset for Amazonian tree species, using inverse distance weighting (IDW). We also propose a new pipeline to deal with inconsistencies in NHCs and to limit the area of occupancy of the species. We found a significant but weak positive relationship between the distribution of NHCs and IDW for 66% of the species. The relationship between SDMs and IDW was also significant but weakly positive for 95% of the species, and sensitivity for both analyses was high. Furthermore, the pipeline removed half of the NHCs records. Presence-only SDM applications should consider this limitation, especially for large biodiversity assessments projects, when they are automatically generated without subsequent checking. Our pipeline provides a conservative estimate of a species' area of occupancy, within an area slightly larger than its extent of occurrence, compatible to e.g. IUCN red list assessments. © 2018 The Author(s).","Species distribution models that predict species occurrence or density by quantifying relationships with environmental variables are used for a variety of scientific investigations and management applications. For endangered species, such as large whales, models help to understand the ecological factors influencing variability in distributions and to assess potential risk from shipping, fishing, and other human activities. Systematic surveys record species presence and absence, as well as the associated search effort, but are very expensive. Presence-only data consisting only of sightings can increase sample size, but may be biased in both geographical and niche space. We built generalized additive models (GAMs) using presence-absence sightings data and maximum entropy models (Maxent) using the same presence-absence sightings data, and also using presence-only sightings data, for four large whale species in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean: humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), blue (Balaenoptera musculus), Bryde's (Balaenoptera edeni), and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus). Environmental variables were surface temperature, surface salinity, thermocline depth, stratification index, and seafloor depth. We compared predicted distributions from each of the two model types. Maxent and GAM model predictions based on systematic survey data are very similar, when Maxent absences are selected from the survey trackline data. However, we show that spatial bias in presence-only Maxent predictions can be caused by using pseudo-absences instead of observed absences and by the sampling biases of both opportunistic data and stratified systematic survey data with uneven coverage between strata. Predictions of uncommon large whale distributions from Maxent or other presence-only techniques may be useful for science or management, but only if spatial bias in the observations is addressed in the derivation and interpretation of model predictions. © 2018 Fiedler, Redfern, Forney, Palacios, Sheredy, Rasmussen, García-Godos, Santillán, Tetley, Félix and Ballance.","Abiotic constraints and biotic interactions act simultaneously to shape communities. However, these community assembly mechanisms are often studied independently, which can limit understanding of how they interact to affect species dynamics and distributions. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian neighborhood modeling approach to quantify the simultaneous effects of topography and crowding by neighbors on the growth of 124,704 individual stems ≥1 cm DBH for 1,047 tropical tree species in a 25-ha mapped rainforest plot in Amazonian Ecuador. We build multi-level regression models to evaluate how four key functional traits (specific leaf area, maximum tree size, wood specific gravity and seed mass) mediate tree growth response to topography and neighborhood crowding. Tree growth is faster in valleys than on ridges and is reduced by neighborhood crowding. Topography and crowding interact to influence tree growth in ~10% of the species. Specific leaf area, maximum tree size and seed mass are associated with growth responses to topography, but not with responses to neighborhood crowding or with the interaction between topography and crowding. In sum, our study reveals that topography and neighborhood crowding each influence tree growth in tropical forests, but act largely independently in shaping species distributions. While traits were associated with species response to topography, their role in species response to neighborhood crowding was less clear, which suggests that trait effects on neighborhood dynamics may depend on the direction (negative/positive) and degree of symmetry of biotic interactions. Our study emphasizes the importance of simultaneously assessing the individual and interactive role of multiple mechanisms in shaping species dynamics in high diversity tropical systems. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America","This study aims to propose a statistical model to automatically assess the correctness of rehabilitation movements performed by patients. Ten Hidden Markov Models are developed and trained, in order to discriminate in real time the main faults in the execution of therapeutic exercises for reeducation after hip replacement surgery. An experiment on real patients shows that the algorithm is as accurate as the physiotherapists to discriminate and identify the error in the movement. The results are discussed in terms of the required setup for a successful implementation of this method in a tele-rehabilitation platform. © 2018 IEEE.","Centaurea is one of the richest but less investigated genera of tribe Cardueae (Asteraceae). We reconstructed an updated phylogeny of Iberian species of Centaurea sects. Centaurea, Jacea, Lepteranthus and Phalolepis by sampling representatives from 48 taxa (~60% of the taxonomic variation). Phylogenetic trees and haplotypic networks were based on ITS and trnLF sequences, and Bayesian dating analysis on ITS data. We found two main lineages within this monophyletic group: (1) a W Mediterranean Centaurea and Phalolepis plus C. diffusa (CP) clade; and (2) an E Mediterranean–Eurosiberian Jacea and Lepteranthus (JL) clade. Our analyses provide new reconstructions for species of C. sects. Jacea and Lepteranthus that support new taxonomic circumscriptions. The inferred divergence times indicated succesive splits of the CP and JL lineages during the Miocene (e.g. CP/JL, Serravalian; Jacea/Lepteranthus, Tortonian; C. hyssopifolia, C. gr. janeri, C. gr. exarata, Messinian) and the Pliocene (C. linifolia/C. antennata). Interspecific hybridizations and polyploidizations likely took place during the Pleistocene (1.5–0.7 Ma) interglacials, when several hybrid lineages apparently originated (e.g. C. x decipiens). Allopatric speciation probably played an important role in the diversification of the Iberian Centaurea taxa, since the origins of several endemic species occurred during mid-late Pleistocene times (2.2–1.3 Ma) in several disjunct Iberian ranges. © 2018 Società Botanica Italiana.","This paper addresses the analysis of three-phase squirrel-cage induction machine (IM) with interturn short-circuit (ITSC) fault and its influence on direct torque control (DTC). The particularities of the DTC such as its behavior, its standard heuristic derivation, and its nature of been a nonlinear hysteresis-based predictive controller are exploited, thus allowing the improvement and development of alternative explanations to the phenomena. The understanding of DTC and the development of the current state-space model of the asymmetric IM, presented here for first time in the literature, enables the analytical treatment of the research topic and the discovery of several DTC reactions to the fault. The ITSC impact on DTC and its reaction leads to the following twofold characterizations: first, unobservable and visible effects, and second, compensation and tolerant reactions. For purposes of simulation, a plug-and-play configurable circuit-block for the asymmetric IM was developed based on Norton's equivalent circuit. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the assertiveness of the developed analyses and theoretical findings, which allows future research in online fault diagnostics and condition monitoring of inverter-fed IM with this type of fault. © 2018 IEEE.","The New World avian family Polioptilidae (gnatcatchers and gnatwrens) is distributed from Argentina to Canada and includes 15 species and more than 60 subspecies. No study to date has evaluated phylogenetic relationships within this family and the historical pattern of diversification within the group remains unknown. Moreover, species limits, particularly in widespread taxa that show geographic variation, remain unclear. In this study, we delimited species and estimated phylogenetic relationships using multilocus data for the entire family. We then used the inferred diversity along with alternative taxonomic classification schemes to evaluate how lumping and splitting of both taxa and geographical areas influenced biogeographic inference. Species-tree analyses grouped Polioptilidae into four main clades: Microbates, Ramphocaenus, a Polioptila guianensis complex, and the remaining members of Polioptila. Ramphocaenus melanurus was sister to the clade containing M. cinereiventris and M. collaris, which formed a clade sister to all species within Polioptila. Polioptila was composed of two clades, the first of which included the P. guianensis complex; the other contained all remaining species in the genus. Using multispecies coalescent modeling, we inferred a more than 3-fold increase in species diversity, of which 87% represent currently recognized species or subspecies. Much of this diversity corresponded to subspecies that occur in the Neotropics. We identified three polyphyletic species, and delimited 4–6 previously undescribed candidate taxa. Probabilistic modeling of geographic ranges on the species tree indicated that the family likely had an ancestral origin in South America, with all three genera independently colonizing North America. Support for this hypothesis, however, was sensitive to the taxonomic classification scheme used and the number of geographical areas allowed. Our study proposes the first phylogenetic hypothesis for Polioptilidae and provides genealogical support for the reclassification of species limits. Species limits and the resolution of geographical areas that taxa inhabit influence the inferred spatial diversification history. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Empirical population genetic studies generally rely on sampling subsets of the population(s) of interest and of the nuclear or organellar genome targeted, assuming each is representative of the whole. Violations of these assumptions may impact population-level parameter estimation and lead to spurious inferences. Here, we used targeted capture to sequence the full mitochondrial genome from 123 individuals of the Galapagos giant tortoise endemic to Pinzón Island (Chelonoidis duncanensis) sampled at 2 time points pre- and postbottleneck (circa 1906 and 2014) to explicitly assess differences in diversity estimates and demographic reconstructions based on subsets of the mitochondrial genome versus the full sequences and to evaluate potential biases associated with diversity estimates and demographic reconstructions from postbottlenecked samples alone. Haplotypic diversities were equal between the temporal samples based on the full mitochondrial genome, but single gene estimates suggested either decreases or increases in diversity depending upon the region. Demographic reconstructions based on the full sequence were more similar between the temporal samples than those based on the control region alone, or a subset of 3 regions, where the trends in population size changes shifted in magnitude and direction between the temporal samples. In all cases, the estimated coalescent point was more distant for the historical than contemporary sample. In summary, our results empirically demonstrate the influence of sampling bias when interpreting population genetic patterns and punctuate the need for careful consideration of potentially conflicting evolutionary signal across the mitochondrial genome. © The American Genetic Association 2018.

The sizes used to determine these estimates can nevertheless be biased by the selectivity of the data source and how well the data represent a population. The average growth of the brachyuran crab Ucides occidentalis (Ortmann, 1897) (Ocypodidae) had been previously estimated utilizing data derived from either commercial catch or scientific field data, consequently generating conflicting results. We determined the average growth of male U. occidentalis by analyzing commercial catch data alone and, subsequently, estimated average growth from a combination of the same commercial data with scientific data collected in situ in mangrove areas (i.e., combined data). Size frequency distributions were constructed using Kernel density estimators, characterizing the modes as Gaussian components. A multi-modal approach was used to select one of five growth models (asymptotic, non-asymptotic, and versatile) that most closely represented the average growth estimated from both cohorts of combined data, which had previously been identified through modal progression, and commercial data. The case 1 of the Schnute model was selected as the best model by Akaike Information and Bayesian Information criteria for both commercial and combined data sets. A convex growth curve was generated for the commercial data (asymptotic growth), whereas an inverted vertical sigmoidal curve was generated for the combined data (non-asymptotic growth). The data sets differed in that commercial data were represented by adult individuals, whereas the combined data included juveniles and adults. This difference significantly affected the average growth estimates calculated for each data set. The growth pattern of male U. occidentalis is best described by a non-asymptotic growth curve, which is consistent with that reported for females of this species. © The Author(s) 2017.

However, there are still some countries in the region, including Ecuador, for which CSFV molecular information is lacking. To better understand the epidemiology of CSFV in the Americas, sequences from CSFVs from Ecuador were generated and a phylodynamic analysis of the virus was performed. Sequences for the full-length glycoprotein E2 gene of twenty field isolates were obtained and, along with sequences from strains previously described in the Americas and from the most representative strains worldwide, were used to analyse the phylodynamics of the virus. Bayesian methods were used to test several molecular clock and demographic models. A calibrated ultrametric tree and a Bayesian skyline were constructed, and codons associated with positive selection involving immune scape were detected. The best model according to Bayes factors was the strict molecular clock and Bayesian skyline model, which shows that CSFV has an evolution rate of 3.2 × 10−4 substitutions per site per year. The model estimates the origin of CSFV in the mid-1500s. There is a strong spatial structure for CSFV in the Americas, indicating that the virus is moving mainly through neighbouring countries. The genetic diversity of CSFV has increased constantly since its appearance, with a slight decrease in mid-twentieth century, which coincides, with eradication campaigns in North America. Even though there is no evidence of strong directional evolution of the E2 gene in CSFV, codons 713, 761, 762 and 975 appear to be selected positively and could be related to virulence or pathogenesis. These results reveal how CSFV has spread and evolved since it first appeared in the Americas and provide important information for attaining the goal of eradication of this virus in Latin America. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","Magnolia mercedesiarum, a new species from the eastern slopes of the Andes in northern Ecuador, is described and illustrated, and a key to Ecuadorian Magnolia (subsect.

Poeciliopsis infans is the only poeciliid species that was able to colonize the temperate highlands of central Mexico. We inferred the phylogenetic relationships, biogeographic history, and historical demography in the widespread Neotropical species P. infans and correlated this with geological events and the Quaternary glacial-interglacial climate in the highlands of central Mexico, using the mitochondrial genes Cytochrome b and Cytochrome oxidase I and two nuclear loci, Rhodopsin and ribosomal protein S7. Results: Populations of P. infans were recovered in two well-differentiated clades. The maximum genetic distances between the two clades were 3.3% for cytb, and 1.9% for coxI. The divergence of the two clades occurred ca. 2.83 Myr. Ancestral area reconstruction revealed a complex biogeographical history for P. infans. The Bayesian Skyline Plot showed a demographic decline, although more visible for clade A, and more recently showed a population expansion in the last 0.025 Myr. Finally, the habitat suitability modelling showed that during the LIG, clade B had more areas with high probabilities of presence in comparison to clade A, whereas for the LGM, clade A showed more areas with high probabilities of presence in comparisons to clade B. Conclusions: Poeciliopsis infans has had a complex evolutionary and biogeographic history, which, as in other co-distributed freshwater fishes, seems to be linked to the volcanic and tectonic activities during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. Populations of P. infans distributed in lowlands showed a higher level of genetic diversity than populations distributed in highlands, which could be linked to more stable and higher temperatures in lowland areas. The fluctuations in population size through time are in agreement with the continuous fluctuations of the climate of central Mexico. © 2018 The Author(s).","The Labour Market Insertion Contract was an Active Labour Market Policy introduced in Spain. It was aimed at individuals who had difficulties entering the labour market, and it was introduced with the purpose of reducing the rate of unemployment. This article provides an estimation of the average impact that this contract had on the employability of individuals in the short and long term. A microeconomic analysis was carried out based on causal statistical inference by using propensity score matching and kernel and radial estimators. Data was taken from the most comprehensive database available, which is the Continuous Sample ofWork Histories. Results are consistent with literature reports and show that the employability of participants was inferior to that of individuals with similar, temporary-type contracts.

We analyzed sequences of mitochondrial and nuclear genes, geographic distributions, as well as photographs of specimens deposited at museum collections. Phylogenetic analyses identified three major lineages formed by populations from: Venezuela and Colombia (M. c. regulus), Ecuador and northern Peru (M. elata, M. castaneiceps, M. orientalis, M. c. chapmani), and central Peru and Bolivia (M. c. coronata). We found further population structure within M. c. regulus and M. c. coronata, and population structure and complexity of plumage variation within the Ecuador-northern Peru lineage. Time-calibrated trees estimated that most intraspecific variation originated during the Pleistocene; however, this pattern may not be attributed to an increase in diversification rate during that period. We discuss these results in the context of the importance of geographic-ecological barriers in promoting lineage diversification along the Andes and put forward a preliminary taxonomic proposal for major lineages identified in this study. © 2018 Prieto-Torres et al.

To do so, the present study proposes a cognitive algorithm based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach to assess in real-time the quality of a human movement recorded through a low-cost motion capture device. The assessment of the correctness of the exercises, which includes the detection of multiple undesirable compensatory movements, shows a very high accuracy (the average performance = 97%). In addition, the proposed model shows a potential for providing the patients with real-time feedback on their performance (up to five times a second). A certain limitation of the model occurs for the compensatory movements characterized by an absence of translational motion of the centre of mass (17% of misclassifications). In this situation, additional features are required to properly assess the quality of the therapeutic exercise. © 2018 [International Journal of Artificial Intelligence].","Accelerating rates of quasiperiodic “drumbeat” long-period earthquakes (LPs) are commonly reported before eruptions at andesite and dacite volcanoes, and promise insights into the nature of fundamental preeruptive processes and improved eruption forecasts. Here we apply a new Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo gamma point process methodology to investigate an exceptionally well-developed sequence of drumbeat LPs preceding a recent large vulcanian explosion at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador. For more than 24 hr, LP rates increased according to the inverse power law trend predicted by material failure theory, and with a retrospectively forecast failure time that agrees with the eruption onset within error. LPs resulted from repeated activation of a single characteristic source driven by accelerating loading, rather than a distributed failure process, showing that similar precursory trends can emerge from quite different underlying physics. Nevertheless, such sequences have clear potential for improving forecasts of eruptions at Tungurahua and analogous volcanoes. ©2018. American Geophysical Union.

The images were obtained under perspective projection with a camera installed on board at the front part of a tractor. Different approaches have addressed the problem based on crop row determination and then assuming that inter-row plants are weeds. Nevertheless, an important challenge is the identification of weeds intermixed within the crop rows. This issue is addressed on this paper by applying a minimum criterion distance based on the Mahalanobis distance derived from a Bayesian classification approach, this makes the main contribution. The identification of both intra- and inter-row weeds is useful for more accurate weed quantification for site-specific treatments. Image quality is affected by uncontrolled lighting conditions in outdoor agricultural environments. Also, different plant densities appear due to different growth stages affecting the crop/weed identification process. The proposed method was designed to deal with the above undesired situations, consisting of three phases: (i) segmentation, (ii) training and (iii) testing. The three phases are executed on-line for each image, where training is specific of each single image, requiring no prior training, as it is usual in common machine learning-based approaches, mainly supervised. This makes the second research contribution. The performance of the proposed approach was quantitatively compared against three existing strategies, achieving an accuracy of 91.8%, pixel-wise determined against ground-truth images manually built, with processing times ≤280 ms, which can be useful for real-time applications. © 2017 IAgrE","The enhancement of ubiquitous and pervasive computing brings new perspectives in terms of medical rehabilitations.

Due to its rarity, aspects about its natural history, ecology and distribution patterns are not well known, therefore, research is needed to generate knowledge about this carnivore and a first step is studying suitable habitat areas. We performed Ecological Niche Models and applied future climate change scenarios (2.6 and 8.5 RCP) to determine the potential distribution of this mammal in Colombia and Ecuador, with current and future climate change conditions; furthermore, we analysed its distribution along several land covers. We found that N. olivacea is likely to be found in areas where no records have been reported previously; likewise, climate change conditions would increase suitable distribution areas. Concerning land cover, 73.4% of N. olivacea potential distribution was located outside Protected Areas (PA), 46.1% in Forests and 40.3% in Agricultural Lands. These findings highlight the need to further research understudied species, furthering our understanding about distribution trends and responses to changing climatic conditions, as well as informig future PA designing. These are essential tools for supporting wildlife conservation plans, being applicable for rare species whose biology and ecology remain unknown. © Medrano-Vizcaino P, Gutierrez-Salazar P.","Andean orogenesis has driven the development of very high plant diversity in theNeotropics through its impact on landscape evolution and climate. The analysis ofthe intraspecific patterns of genetic structure in plants would permit inferring theeffects of Andean uplift on the evolution and diversification of Neotropical flora. Inthis study, using microsatellite markers and Bayesian clustering analyses, we reportthe presence of four genetic clusters for the palm Oenocarpus bataua var. batauawhich are located within four biogeographic regions in northwestern South America:(a) Chocó rain forest, (b) Amotape-Huancabamba Zone, (c) northwestern Amazonianrain forest, and (d) southwestern Amazonian rain forest. We hypothesize that theseclusters developed following three genetic diversification events mainly promoted byAndean orogenic events. Additionally, the distinct current climate dynamics amongnorthwestern and southwestern Amazonia may maintain the genetic diversificationdetected in the western Amazon basin. Genetic exchange was identified betweenthe clusters, including across the Andes region, discarding the possibility of any cluster to diversify as a distinct intraspecific variety. We identified a hot spot of geneticdiversity in the northern Peruvian Amazon around the locality of Iquitos. We alsodetected a decrease in diversity with distance from this area in westward and southward direction within the Amazon basin and the eastern Andean foothills. Additionally,we confirmed the existence and divergence of O. bataua var. bataua from var. oligocarpus in northern South America, possibly expanding the distributional range of thelatter variety beyond eastern Venezuela, to the central and eastern Andean cordilleras of Colombia. Based on our results, we suggest that Andean orogenesis is themain driver of genetic structuring and diversification in O. bataua within northwestern South America. © 2018 The Authors.","This study aims to develop a telemedicine platform for self-motor rehabilitation and remote monitoring by health professionals, in order to enhance recovery in patients after hip replacement. The implementation of such a technology is justified by medical (improvement of the recovery process by the possibility to perform rehabilitation exercises more frequently), economic (reduction of the number of medical appointments and the time patients spend at the hospital), mobility (diminution of the transportation to and from the hospital) and ethics (healthcare democratization and increased empowerment of the patient) purposes. The Kinect camera is used as a Natural User Interface to capture the physical exercises performed at home by the patients. The quality of the movement is evaluated in real-time by an assessment module implemented according to a Hidden-Markov Model approach. The results show a high accuracy in the evaluation of the movements (92% of correct classification). Finally, the usability of the platform is tested through the System Usability Scale (SUS). The overall SUS score is 81 out of 100, which suggests a good usability of the Web application. Further work will focus on the development of additional functionalities and an evaluation of the impact of the platform on the recovery process. © 2018, Universidade Catolica Portuguesa.

The present work proposes an autonomic communication system, which uses a system of decision-making based on a Bayesian network, and a knowledge base based on an ontology, to take decisions of reconfiguration in the system. The main goal of the autonomic communication system is to adapt the communications platform to the characteristics of the context, in order to improve its performance. The ontology provides the knowledge about the performance factors and their relationships in the communication networks, to configure the structure of the Bayesian network. The Bayesian network is the stochastic reasoning mechanism used by the decision-making system. We present several tests on the NS2 simulator. In the tests carried out, we observe an improvement between 85% and 96% in the system performance, for scenarios where our approach of autonomic decision reconfigures the communication system. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

Using a policy-design framework, we identify a causal mechanism linking the opening of a policy window to policy change as a combination of the emergence of a new policy network, the adoption of a new policy paradigm and the selection of a new instruments mix. Drawing on Bayesian statistics, the 11 tests conducted on the causal mechanism show the importance of State resources of information, authority, treasury and organization to assess the outcome of policy change. © 2018, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota Colombia.

The adoption of policy aims triggers an institutional drift at three levels. At a normative level, bureaucratic centralism is adopted by the government. At the strategic level a sectorial policy fostering the statés control over the policy area is formulated. At an operational level, the government favors coercive conflict management to cope with protests against the extractive policy. The theoretical causal mechanism is confirmed after passing 19/20 empirical tests, which raises the posterior confidence up to 0.73 according to the Bayesian formalization. The findings show a way for institutional and policy change to tackle the resource curse, even though further research on other typical cases (such as Venezuela) and deviant cases (such as Mexico) should increase the external validity of the theory. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Usually, time series acquired from some measurement in a dynamical system are the main source of information about its internal structure and complex behavior.

The main goals of this study were to investigate the phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic delimitation of the genera of the Milla complex and particularly of M. biflora. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference analyses were conducted using plastid and nuclear DNA sequence data and 60 morphological traits. We constructed independent data matrices that included 19 of the 20 species of the Milla complex and five outgroup species from the Brodiaea complex. Evolution of floral traits was also investigated. The phylogenetic trees showed incongruence among data matrices, but the total-evidence analysis supported the monophyly of Bessera and Petronymphe. Milla and Dandya were paraphyletic as traditionally circumscribed. The results suggest that genera of the Milla complex have evolved to show long floral tubes covering the ovary and erect flowers. The Milla s.s. clade included three main groups allied to (1) M. bryanii, (2) M. biflora and (3) M. oaxacana. Thus, our study supports the recognition of Bessera, Jaimehintonia, Petronymphe and Milla s.s. in the Milla complex that are defined by several synapomorphic characters, including connate filaments and T-shaped leaf vascular bundle for Bessera and four floral characters for Milla s.s. Our evidence suggests that Dandya should be re-circumscribed as two genera, one including the type species, D. purpusii. © 2017 The Linnean Society of London.","The implementation of multi-stage splitting integrators is essentially the same as the implementation of the familiar Strang/Verlet method. Therefore multi-stage formulas may be easily incorporated into software that now uses the Strang/Verlet integrator. We study in detail the two-parameter family of palindromic, three-stage splitting formulas and identify choices of parameters that may outperform the Strang/Verlet method. One of these choices leads to a method of effective order four suitable to integrate in time some partial differential equations. Other choices may be seen as perturbations of the Strang method that increase efficiency in molecular dynamics simulations and in Hybrid Monte Carlo sampling. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Size-related shifts in feeding habits of juvenile yellowfin tuna (YFT), Thunnus albacares (Bonnaterre, 1788), in Ecuadorian waters were assessed using stomach content analysis (SCA) (n = 339) and stable isotope analysis (n = 83). In all size classes, fishes were the predominant prey group in the diet (Alimentary Index, %AI = 96.86) followed by cephalopods (%AI = 3.29) and crustaceans (%AI = 0.03). PERMANOVA analysis revealed significant variations in diet with body size: i) Class I YFT (≤50 cm in fork length, FL) fed mainly on laternfishes, family Myctophidae (%AI = 37.34), and jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas (%AI = 36.06), Class II YFT (50–60 cm, FL) consumed bullet and frigate tunas, Auxis spp., unidentifiable fish and jumbo squid (%AI = 47.75, %AI = 25.06 and%AI = 21.67, respectively), and Class III YFT (≥ 60 cm, FL) preyed almost exclusively on bullet and frigate tunas (%AI = 90.85). Mean ± SD muscle isotope values were 12.14 ± 1.95‰ for δ15N and −17.42 ± 0.27 for δ13C‰; mean (±SD) liver values were 11.30‰ for δ15N and −17.42 ± 0.27‰ for δ13C. Overall, liver and muscle samples showed significant size-related differences in δ15N and δ13C. Stable isotope Bayesian ellipses, SEAc, did not show trophic overlap among size classes. A significant positive linear correlation was observed between δ15N and δ13C measured in liver and muscle tissues with body size, suggesting an increase of prey size as tuna grew. These results indicate that the observed size-related diet shifts are not only related to prey type, but also to prey size. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","We extend an alternative, phenomenological approach to inflation by means of an equation of state and a sound speed, both of them functions of the number of e-folds and four phenomenological parameters. This approach captures a number of possible inflationary models, including those with non-canonical kinetic terms or scale-dependent non-gaussianities. We perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses using the latest cosmological publicly available measurements, which include Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from the Planck satellite. Within this parameterization, we discard scale invariance with a significance of about 10σ, and the running of the spectral index is constrained as αs=−0.60−0.10 +0.08×10−3 (68% CL errors). The limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio is r<0.005 at 95% CL from CMB data alone. We find no significant evidence for this alternative parameterization with present cosmological observations. The maximum amplitude of the equilateral non-gaussianity that we obtain, |fNL equil|<1, is much smaller than the current Planck mission errors, strengthening the case for future high-redshift, all-sky surveys, which could reach the required accuracy on equilateral non-gaussianities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","A bearing is an essential component in rotating machinery, one of its principal cause of failure, and its health condition is directly related to the safety and effective operation of such machinery. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that a probabilistic fuzzy system is applied to bearing fault classification. The type of probabilistic fuzzy classifier considered is a parsimonious fuzzy rule based model where each rule can diagnose a set of faults each one with its probability. For this kind of real world application, it is desirable to develop interpretable and accurate MIMO fuzzy systems, able to deal with the dimensionality and uncertainty present in data (vibration signals). For parameter estimation we adopt a two steps sequential state-of-the-art data-driven method. First, the antecedents of the rules are estimated using an iterative supervised clustering algorithm. Based on the antecedents the consequent parameters are then estimated. For this, a new method for consequent estimation is proposed. This is based on the observation that for defining a rule consequent not all training data within the region of applicability of that rule are equality relevant. Two criteria for selecting a relevant region in the feature space for consequent parameter estimation are proposed. Results show a statistically significant improvement on the performance of probabilistic fuzzy diagnosers trained with the proposed method, independently of the criterion used for defining the relevant region, when compared with the above mentioned state-of-the-art method. Moreover, the proposed consequent parameter estimation method practically has no overhead on the overall training of the diagnoser. Results show that an equilibrium can be found between the model level of detail and its accuracy. However, when accuracy is the sole comparison criterion, the proposed probabilistic fuzzy systems systematically matches the performance of other data-driven models like distance based methods (K-nearest neighbors), connectionists (probabilistic neural networks), or maximum margin classifiers (support vector machines). © 2017","Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp., is one of the most serious diseases affecting tamarillo (Solanum betaceum) production in the Ecuadorian highlands. The objective of this study was to characterise Colletotrichum isolates obtained from tamarillo to clarify its taxonomic and phylogenetic position. Based on phenotypic and morphologic characterisation, the isolates of this study were consistently grouped within the Colletotrichum acutatum complex. Multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis based on combined sequences of actin (ACT), β-tubulin (TUB2), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) sequences using Bayesian probabilities, indicated that 16 of 20 isolates from Imbabura, Cotopaxi, Tungurahua, Bolivar, Chimborazo, Azuay and Loja provinces, belonged to C. tamarilloi. This study represents the first reported case of anthracnose of S. betaceum caused by C. tamarilloi in the Ecuadorian highlands. Interestingly, pathogenicity tests and multilocus molecular analysis revealed a new infraspecific and more aggressive species formed by four isolates obtained from the Pichincha province. These findings probably provided interesting information related to mutant isolates and a possible description of a new pathogenic species affecting tamarillo fruits. © 2017, Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.","Background: Rhodnius ecuadoriensis is the main triatomine vector of Chagas disease, American trypanosomiasis, in Southern Ecuador and Northern Peru. Genomic approaches and next generation sequencing technologies have become powerful tools for investigating population diversity and structure which is a key consideration for vector control. Here we assess the effectiveness of three different 2b restriction site-associated DNA (2b-RAD) genotyping strategies in R. ecuadoriensis to provide sufficient genomic resolution to tease apart microevolutionary processes and undertake some pilot population genomic analyses. Methodology/Principal findings: The 2b-RAD protocol was carried out in-house at a non-specialized laboratory using 20 R. ecuadoriensis adults collected from the central coast and southern Andean region of Ecuador, from June 2006 to July 2013. 2b-RAD sequencing data was performed on an Illumina MiSeq instrument and analyzed with the STACKS de novo pipeline for loci assembly and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) discovery. Preliminary population genomic analyses (global AMOVA and Bayesian clustering) were implemented. Our results showed that the 2b-RAD genotyping protocol is effective for R. ecuadoriensis and likely for other triatomine species. However, only BcgI and CspCI restriction enzymes provided a number of markers suitable for population genomic analysis at the read depth we generated. Our preliminary genomic analyses detected a signal of genetic structuring across the study area. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings suggest that 2b-RAD genotyping is both a cost effective and methodologically simple approach for generating high resolution genomic data for Chagas disease vectors with the power to distinguish between different vector populations at epidemiologically relevant scales. As such, 2b-RAD represents a powerful tool in the hands of medical entomologists with limited access to specialized molecular biological equipment. © 2017 Hernandez-Castro et al.","Background El Niño and its effect on local meteorological conditions potentially influences interannual variability in dengue transmission in southern coastal Ecuador. El Oro province is a key dengue surveillance site, due to the high burden of dengue, seasonal transmission, co-circulation of all four dengue serotypes, and the recent introduction of chikungunya and Zika. In this study, we used climate forecasts to predict the evolution of the 2016 dengue season in the city of Machala, following one of the strongest El Niño events on record. Methods We incorporated precipitation, minimum temperature, and Niño3·4 index forecasts in a Bayesian hierarchical mixed model to predict dengue incidence. The model was initiated on Jan 1, 2016, producing monthly dengue forecasts until November, 2016. We accounted for misreporting of dengue due to the introduction of chikungunya in 2015, by using active surveillance data to correct reported dengue case data from passive surveillance records. We then evaluated the forecast retrospectively with available epidemiological information. Findings The predictions correctly forecast an early peak in dengue incidence in March, 2016, with a 90% chance of exceeding the mean dengue incidence for the previous 5 years. Accounting for the proportion of chikungunya cases that had been incorrectly recorded as dengue in 2015 improved the prediction of the magnitude of dengue incidence in 2016. Interpretation This dengue prediction framework, which uses seasonal climate and El Niño forecasts, allows a prediction to be made at the start of the year for the entire dengue season. Combining active surveillance data with routine dengue reports improved not only model fit and performance, but also the accuracy of benchmark estimates based on historical seasonal averages. This study advances the state-of-the-art of climate services for the health sector, by showing the potential value of incorporating climate information in the public health decision-making process in Ecuador.

The eight currently recognized species occur in the lowlands of South and Central America. Based on the largest taxon and character sampling to date, we analyze three mitochondrial and one nuclear gene using Bayesian methods to (1) infer the phylogeny of Polychrus under both concatenated-tree and speciestree methods; (2) identify lineages that could represent putative undescribed species; and (3) estimate divergence times. Our species tree places P. acutirostris as the sister taxon to all other species of Polychrus. While the phylogenetic position of P. gutturosus and P. peruvianus is poorly resolved, P. marmoratus and P. femoralis are strongly supported as sister to P. liogaster and P. jacquelinae, respectively. Recognition of P. auduboni and P. marmoratus sensu stricto as distinct species indicates that the populations of \"P. marmoratus\" from the Amazon and the Atlantic coast in Brazil represent separate species. Similarly, populations of P. femoralis from the Tumbes region might belong to a cryptic undescribed species. Relative divergence times and published age estimates suggest that the orogeny of the Andes did not play a significant role in the early evolution of Polychrus. © 2017 Torres-Carvajal et al.

Malaria, which has a cyclicality in its dynamics, is closely related to climatic, ecological and socio-economic phenomena. The main objective of this research has been to compare three different prediction species models, the so-called Maxent, logistic regression and multi criteria evaluation with fuzzy logic, in order to determine the model which best describes the ecological niche of the Anopheles spp species, which transmits malaria within Ecuador. After performing a detailed data collection and data processing, we applied the mentioned models and validated them with a statistical analysis in order to discover that the Maxent model has been the model that best defines the distribution of Anopheles spp within the territory. The determined sites, which are of high strategic value and important for the increasing national development, will now be able to initiate preventive countermeasures based on this study. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Given the geographical complexity of the Andes, species distributions hold interesting information regarding the history of isolation and gene flow across geographic barriers and ecological gradients. Moreover, current threats to the region's enormous plant diversity pose an additional challenge to the understanding of these patterns. We explored the geographic structure of genetic diversity within the Ceroxylon quindiuense species complex (wax palms) at a regional scale, using a model-based approach to disentangle the historical mechanisms by which these species have dispersed over a range encompassing 17 of latitude in the tropical Andes. A total of 10 microsatellite loci were cross-amplified in 8 populations of the 3 species comprising the C. quindiuense complex. Analyses performed include estimates of molecular diversity and genetic structure, testing for genetic bottlenecks and an evaluation of the colonization scenario under approximate Bayesian computation. We showed that there was a geographical diversity gradient reflecting the orogenetic pattern of the northern Andes and its end at the cordilleras facing the Caribbean Sea. A general pattern of diversity suggests that the cordilleras of Colombia have served as historical recipients of gene flow occurring only scantly along the northern Andes. We provided evidence of important isolation between the largest populations of this complex, suggesting that both historical constraints to dispersal but also current anthropogenic effects might explain the high levels of population structuring. We provide a list of advisable measures for conservation stakeholders. © The American Genetic Association 2016.

To understand how the reliabilities, sensitivities, and vulnerabilities of reservoir operations vary across hydrogeologic settings, a bottom-up approach was applied to investigate the reliability of two water resources systems in the future. To represent the uncertainty associated with future streamflow, global climate model projections were integrated with a formal Bayesian uncertainty analysis and groundwater-surface water hydrologic modeling. Finally, the effectiveness of variable rule curves for mitigating the effects of climate change was evaluated. Increasing air temperature appeared to reduce the reliability of meeting summer environmental flow targets in the future by 42 and 12% for the groundwater basin and surface water basin, respectively, but had negligible impacts on reservoir refilling and flood regulation. Variable rule curves mitigated the impact of climate change on summer flow target reliability without compromising flood risk reduction. Differences in subbasin sensitivity to changing climate were evident across the two hydrogeologic settings, and uncertainty associated with modeling groundwater resources and decision thresholds were identified, with implications for reliability assessments in other basins. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","The aim of the paper is to present a Bayesian Network (BN) for predicting reputation of members of Virtual Learning Communities using direct interactions between them considering the theory of the rewards of behavioral Psychology.

In this study, we appraised results from taxonomy, genetics, phylogenetics, phylogeography and pollination ecology to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus Galvezia. Location: Peru, continental Ecuador and Galápagos. Methods: We sequenced the nuclear ribosomal ITS and two plastid regions, ndhF and ndhF-rpL32, to infer the origin of Galvezia and patterns of colonization to and across the Galápagos archipelago, based on Bayesian inference and statistical parsimony analyses. To investigate genetic diversity and differentiation within G. leucantha, we screened the genome of six populations and obtained 194 AFLP fingerprints. Autogamy tests and pollination network analyses were performed to evaluate the colonization potential and to investigate the structure of the pollinators’ assemblage of Galvezia. Results: Relationships of seven nucleotide-substitution haplotypes and 11 nucleotide-substitution ribotypes of Galvezia revealed monophyly for the Galapagos species. Dating estimates indicated divergence of the insular Galvezia lineage in the Middle-Upper Pleistocene (0.66–0.09 Ma). In addition, distribution of genotypes (seven haplotypes, eight ribotypes) across the three continental species showed geographical differentiation, while low differentiation and distribution of G. leucantha. AFLP genetic diversity is relatively high (HT = 0.109), but a low proportion of the total allelic variance is attributed to variation among subspecies/islands (Hb = 0.035, hierarchical AMOVA: 3.77% of total variance). The endemic bee (Xylocopa darwinii) accounted for 87.30% of the floral visits to G. leucantha. Main conclusions: We inferred a single origin for an insular lineage that colonized the Galápagos Islands from northern Peru in the Pleistocene. Recent colonization of the archipelago, Pleistocene land bridges between islands and active gene flow promoted by X. darwinii may account for the low-moderate genetic differentiation of G. leucantha subspecies. An unusual pollination shift from ornithophily (hummingbirds on the continent) to entomophily (Xylocopa in the Galápagos Islands) is supported. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","This study investigated how reservoir performance varied across different hydrogeologic settings and under plausible future climate scenarios. Modelling was conducted for the Santiam River Basin, OR, USA, comparing the North Santiam Basin, with high permeability and extensive groundwater (GW) storage, and the South Santiam Basin, with low permeability, little GW storage, and rapid runoff response. The coupling of projections of future temperature and precipitation from global climate models, a surface water–GW hydrologic model, and a formal Bayesian uncertainty analysis produced synthetic hydrographs of reservoir inflows. Inflow hydrographs were summarized as median and extreme future flows for inputs to a reservoir operations model. The performance of reservoir operations was evaluated as the failure to meet flood management, spring and summer environmental flows, and hydropower generation objectives. Despite projected increases in winter flows and decreases in summer flows, results provided little evidence of a response in reservoir operation performance to a changing climate, with the exception of summer flow targets. Independent of climate impacts, historical prioritization of reservoir operations played an important role in the reliability of flood regulation, demonstrating the importance of reservoir operations relative to hydrologic responses to climate change in this basin. Results also highlight how hydrologic uncertainty is likely to complicate planning for climate change in basins with substantial GW interactions. © 2016 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.","Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L. 1753) is a plant of great cultural, economic and ecological importance globally. By its structure and function maintains a wide variety of animal species. In Latin America, their crops are being affected by the disease called ‘frosty pod rot of cocoa’ caused by the fungus Moniliophthora roreri (Cif & Par) Evans. 2007, considered as the most destructive disease that attacks cocoa and kills it. The increase of temperature or precipitation because of warming global climate change could favor the fungus expansion to areas previously unaffected. We modeled the potential distribution for M. roreri and T. cocoa using MaxEnt and circulation model general HADCM3, A2a scenario with climatic variables for the present and the future (5, 35 and 65 years), in order to find sites suitable for monitoring to prevent the fungus spread, and to identify which variables determine the presence of M. roreri. The suitable areas for both species overlap from present to 2050, while they are different in 2080. M. roreri could extend from southern Ecuador to Venezuela, spread to westernmost Amazon, southwest Peruvian Amazon, and to the Peruvian-Bolivian border and the adjacent areas of Brazil. In both taxa the most influential variable seems to be precipitation of the wettest month. The Brazilian Amazon is the areas of South America with the largest plantations of T. cocoa, and therefore the most sensitive to the presence and proliferation of the fungus. For this reason we recommend to set up a monitoring system allowing early warning and control of incipient outbreaks that could eventually destroy Bolivian and Brazilian cocoa plantations. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

These strains were spread to United States in 2013 through an intercontinental transmission from China with further spreading across the world, evidencing the emergent nature of these strains. In the present study, an analysis of PEDV field sequences from Ecuador was conducted by comparing all the PEDV S gene sequences available in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic comparisons and Bayesian phylogeographic inference based on complete S gene sequences were also conducted to track the origin and putative route of PEDV. The sequence from the PED-outbreak in Ecuador was grouped into the clade II of PEDV genogroup 2a together with other sequences of isolates from Mexico, Canada, and United States. The phylogeographic study revealed the emergence of the Chinese PEDV strains, followed by spreading to US in 2013, from US to Korea, and later the introduction of PEDV to Canada, Mexico, and Ecuador directly from the US. The sources of imports of live swine in Ecuador in 2014 were mainly from Chile and US. Thus, this movement of pigs is suggested as the main way for introducing PEDV to Ecuador. © 2017 Maritza Barrera et al.","This article shows the application the fragment-asperity interaction theory to the earthquakes catalog of Ecuador. This catalog contains earthquakes generated by an oblique subduction, by the movement of a sliver plate and by several shallow faults. In this scenario, the nonextensive q parameter of the theory is calculated and it is compared with other regions. The q parameter for Ecuador is higher than for other seismic catalogs. We compute the parameter q of two types of seismicity originated in different physical processes: shallow earthquakes and intermediate-depth earthquakes. For the latter, the value of q is slightly higher than for the former. An essential contribution of this article is to show the calculation of the q parameter by an algorithm that solves the inverse problem from a Bayesian approach.","The genus Culicoides includes vectors of important animal diseases such as bluetongue and Schmallenberg virus (BTV and SBV). This genus includes 1300 species classified in 32 subgenera and 38 unclassified species. However, the phylogenetic relationships between different subgenera of Culicoides have never been studied. Phylogenetic analyses of 42 species belonging to 12 subgenera and 8 ungrouped species of genus Culicoides from Ecuador, France, Gabon, Madagascar and Tunisia were carried out using two molecular markers (28S rDNA D1 and D2 domains and COI mtDNA). Sequences were subjected to non-probabilistic (maximum parsimony) and probabilistic (Bayesian inference (BI)) approaches. The subgenera Monoculicoides, Culicoides, Haematomyidium, Hoffmania, Remmia and Avaritia (including the main vectors of bluetongue disease) were monophyletic, whereas the subgenus Oecacta was paraphyletic. Our study validates the subgenus Remmia (= Schultzei group) as a valid subgenus, outside of the subgenus Oecacta. In Europe, Culicoides obsoletus, Culicoides scoticus and Culicoides chiopterus should be part of the Obsoletus complex whereas Culicoides dewulfi should be excluded from this complex. Our study suggests that the current Culicoides classification needs to be revisited with modern tools. © 2017 D.

Ultimately, data from 37 animals (23 mothers with a calf and 14 unsexed adults) were included in the assessment. Transmissions were filtered and behavior states defined using a Bayesian state-space model. Mean tag longevity was 14.2 d (SD = 12.43; range: 1 to 70 d), and longevity was significantly longer in mothers (53%) than in unsexed individuals (t test = 2.43, p = 0.02). Based on the extent of their movements, two different habitat use patterns were recognized and referred to as short range (SR) and long range (LR). SR movements were associated mainly with slow, area-restricted movements (ARM) and short periods of fast, directed movement (FDM). LR movements were related mainly to FDM and, in some cases, with short ARM periods. We found significant differences in the proportion of time spent in each behavioral mode and in swim speed between mothers and unsexed individuals (p < 0.01, in all cases). Mothers displaying SR movements stayed in relatively small areas with back and forth movements up to 350 km along the coast; the 95% home range (kernel density) was estimated to be 61,105 km2 in whales from Panama and 26,331 km2 in whales from Ecuador. In mothers displaying LR movements, distribution range was seven times greater in Panama and up to 2.5 times greater in Ecuador. Since tag longevity was not significantly different between SR and LR movements in females (t test = 0.063, p > 0.05), a shift from the nursing to migration phase is a plausible explanation for this increased range. Information from unsexed animals is inconclusive because of the short tracking periods. Mothers were distributed closer to shore than other tagged unsexed individuals, but both types of whales swam into deeper waters mainly during migration. Our results confirm maternal-biased stratification in this population along the entire breeding range. These findings have important implications for coastal management, including reduction of risk posed by human activities such as bycatch, ship strikes, and whale watching.","The trophic level and ecological role of species in the ecosystem are determined by their feeding habits. While the trophic level and niche width are characteristic at population level, trophic overlap indicates the interaction between populations of a community. Three apex predators coexist in Uruguayan waters: Franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei), South American sea lion (SASL, Otaria flavescens) and South American fur seal (SAFS, Arctocephalus australis). The two otariids consume different main prey species and have different isotopic niche, whereas feeding habits of Franciscana dolphin in Uruguayan waters remain practically unknown. This study aimed to determine Franciscana diet composition by stomach content and stable isotope (δ13C and δ15N) analyses, and to assess trophic overlap in diet composition as well as in isotopic niche space among the three apex predators. Diet composition of each species was estimated by Bayesian mixing models with prior information on the diet of predators. Moreover, Bayesian ellipses were used to define the isotopic niche space and overlap among the three species. Diets among predators varied: diet of SAFS was composed mainly by a few pelagic prey species, diet of SASL was more diverse and included pelagic and benthic preys, and for Franciscana dolphin the diet was mainly composed by coastal prey species. The SAFS had the largest isotopic niche area compared to the Franciscana and the SASL. The isotopic niche of the SASL did not overlap with those of the other two species. Although the Franciscana and the SAFS overlap in isotopic space, they do not overlap in feeding areas; this is because particulate organic matter δ13C values increase from inner Rio de la Plata to the estuary and the Atlantic Coast. Here, the relevance of using different sources of information to reach strong conclusions about feeding habits of marine predators and about co-use of resources is shown, mainly in environments where variation in δ13C can be related to diverse reasons. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Although recent years have seen an increase in genetic analyses that identify new species of cephalopods and phylogeographic patterns, the loliginid squid of South America remain one of the least studied groups. The suggestion that Doryteuthis plei may represent distinct lineages within its extensive distribution along the western Atlantic coasts from Cape Hatteras, USA (36°N) to northern Argentina (35°S) is consistent with significant variation in a number of environmental variables along this range including in both temperature and salinity. In the present study D. plei samples were obtained from a large number of localities along the western Atlantic coasts to investigate the distribution of these possible species in a phylogeographic context. Phylogeographic analyses were performed using the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I gene and nuclear Rhodopsin gene. Divergence times were estimated using Bayesian strict clock dating with calibrations based on fossil records for divergence from the lineage containing Vampyroteuthis infernalis (162 mya), the probable origins of the North American loliginids (45 mya), and the European loliginids (20 mya) and fossil statolith from Doryteuthis opalescens (3 mya). Our results suggest a deep genetic divergence within Doryteuthis plei. The currently described specie consists of two genetically distinct clades (pair-wise genetic divergence of between 7.7 and 9.1%). One clade composed of individuals collected in northwestern Atlantic and Central Caribbean Atlantic waters and the other from southwestern Atlantic waters. The divergence time and sampling locations suggest the speciation process at approximately 16 Mya, which is in full agreement with the middle Miocene orogeny of the Caribbean plate, ending up with the formation of the Lesser Antilles and the adjacent subduction zone, coinciding with a particularly low global sea level, resulting in the practical absence of continental shelves at the area, and therefore an effective geographic barrier for D. plei. Furthermore, this study also provides evidence of previously undocumented sub-population structuring in the Gulf of Mexico. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Accelerating taxonomic knowledge and making accurate species identifications are critically important given the current biodiversity crisis, particularly in biodiversity hotspots such as Mesoamerica. Objective species delimitation that reduces investigator-driven bias is fundamental to the establishment of appropriate conservation strategies, above all in managed species. Previous morphological and molecular studies on three managed stingless bee species of the genus Scaptotrigona distributed in Mexico (S. mexicana, S. pectoralis and S. hellwegeri) suggested that both S. mexicana and S. hellwegeri are cryptic species complexes. Herein we tested species delimitation by analysing sequence information of five markers (two mitochondrial: cox1 and 16S, and three nuclear: ITS1, EF1-α, ArgK) within a Bayesian coalescent framework to test the putative species. We obtained two different hypotheses using a Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC) model: four (cox1) and six (16S) species. After the species validation step with the Bayesian species-delimitation analysis (BPP), we suggest that only S. mexicana is a complex of two species with different distribution (along the Pacific and the Atlantic coasts, respectively). We highly recommend avoiding colony exchange between geographical regions in order to conserve the genetic integrity of both taxa. © 2016 The Royal Entomological Society","This paper presents a comparison of the performance of different control algorithms in two types of systems; one exhibiting fast dynamics and the other slow dynamics. The first control system regulates the speed of a DC motor, while the second control system regulates the temperature of an electrical heater. This systems' performance comparison pretends to evaluate the energy consumption, as well as the controllers' transient response in order to identify the best control strategy for each system. System models are obtained through the responses to a pseudorandom binary signal (PRBS) and the least squares fit method using an auto-regressive model with an exogenous variable (ARX). The implemented control algorithms used in this study are: Pole placement regulator (state-space controller) with integral error processing, auto-tunable proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, neural PID controller, unconstrained model predictive control (MPC), fuzzy PID controller, neuro-fuzzy controller, bayesian controller and an optimal quadratic regulator (LQR). A detailed analysis of the performance and energy consumption index is performed, that allow the categorization of the control strategies in accordance with their performance. © 2016 IEEE.","In this work we applied Variable Mesh Optimization population metaheuristc (VMO) for Bayesian network (BN) structure learning as a score-and-search method. Our idea was to represent each node of the Mesh as a Bayesian network through a set of arcs. Then new BNs are created using (union and difference) operations among sets. For this process, three types of BNs are identified, local optima (BNs with the best score in each neighborhood), global optima (BN with the best score among local optima), and frontier solutions (most and least different in structure BNs). Finally the clearing process is applied to select the most representative BNs in the Mesh (score and structure). For determining the global score, each BN is used as a Bayesian classifier and classification accuracy is obtained using cross validation over dataset. The proposal is compared with other classifiers using UCI repository data set. Results show that our proposal obtains the best score, that proves to be a very competitive algorithm for supervised classification. © 2016 IEEE.","This paper presents a spatiotemporal dynamic model which allows Bayesian inference of precipitation states in some Venezuelan meteorological stations. One of the limitations that are reported in digital databases is the reliability of the records and the lack of information for certain days, weeks, or months. To complete the missing data, the Gibbs algorithm, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure, was used. A feature of precipitation series is that their distribution contains discrete and continuous components implying complicated dynamics. A model is proposed based on a discrete representation of a stochastic integro-difference equation. Given the difficulty of obtaining explicit analytical expressions for the predictive posterior distribution, approximations were obtained using a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm called the parallelized ensemble Kalman filter. The proposed method permits the completion of the missing data in the series where required and secondly allows the splitting of a large database into smaller ones for separate evaluation and eventual combination of the individual results. The objective is to reduce the dimension and computational cost in order to obtain models that are able to describe the reality in real time. It was shown that the obtained models are able to predict spatially and temporally the states of rainfall for at least three to four days quickly, efficiently and accurately. Three methods of statistical validation were used to evaluate the performance of the model and showed no significant discrepancies. Speedup and efficiency factors were calculated to compare the speed of calculation using the parallelized ensemble Kalman filter algorithm with the speed of the sequential version. The improvement in speed for four pthread executions was greatest. © Brazilian Statistical Association, 2016.","While the effects of climate change on top predators are well documented, the role of predation on ecosystem level carbon production is poorly developed, despite it being a logical consequence of trophic dynamics. Trophic cascade effects have shown predator mediated changes in primary production, but we predict that predators should lower the overall biomass capacity of any system with top down control. Through a simple Bayesian belief network model of a typical marine foodweb, we show that predator removal, as is common through activities such as fishing and shark finning, results in higher biomasses of lower trophic level fish and zooplankton, resulting in higher net carbon production by the system. In situations common throughout much of the ocean, where activities such as shark finning and over fishing reduce the highest tropic levels, the probability of net carbon production increasing in the model was ~ 60%, and unlike previous studies on simple food chains, trophic cascade effects were not present. While the results are preliminary, and sources of uncertainty in data and models are acknowledged, such results provide even more strength to the argument to protect open sea fish stocks, and particularly large predators such as sharks, cetaceans and game fish. © 2016 The Authors","In modern decision making systems, it is necessary to develop ways to optimize the decisions. To achieve this objective, new paradigms are necessary, as those linked to autonomic paradigm, which establishes, among other things, the self-configuration of the systems in order to improve their performances. On this basis, this paper proposes a system of autonomous decision, based on Bayesian networks and ontologies, to optimize and adapt a system to the characteristics of the context. The ontology provides the knowledge about the context to study, to configure the structure of the Bayesian network, while this latter is the stochastic reasoning mechanism used by the decision-making system. To verify the operation of our approach, it is used in an autonomic communication system. In the tests realized we could observe an improvement in the system performance. © 2016 IEEE.","We present a dated phylogenetic tree for the Neotropical genus Attalea (Arecaceae). We used six orthologues from the nuclear WRKY gene family across 98 accessions to address relationships among species and biogeographical hypotheses. We found that the formerly recognized groups within Attalea are not monophyletic and therefore there is no support for multiple genera as previously thought. Species of Attalea-like palms from the Atlantic forest form a well-supported clade sister to the Attalea species from Amazonia, the Andean valleys and Mesoamerica. Dates for the main divergence events suggest a relationship with the development of the dry forests that now span eastern South America and the now-lost Pebas Lake region in the western Amazon. Attalea crassispatha possibly colonized Hispaniola by a long-distance dispersal event, not via the land bridge Great Antilles Avian Ridge (GAAR), before the Panama channel closed. The common ancestor of Attalea appears to have been an Atlantic forest clade c. 30 Mya. The early split between the Atlantic-forest clade and the two Amazonian-northern Andean clades was probably the result of climatic changes that caused an increase in aridity in South America. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London","We re-examined the biogeography of the leaf-toed geckos (Phyllodactylus) endemic to the Galápagos Islands by analyzing for the first time samples of P. gilberti, a species endemic to Wolf island, in a phylogenetic framework. Our aim was to test the three-colonizations scenario previously proposed for these lizards and estimate the age of each colonization event. To achieve this we estimated simultaneously a species tree and divergence times with Bayesian methods. Our results supported the three-colonizations scenario. Similar to a previous hypothesis, the species tree obtained here showed that most species of Phyllodactylus are nested in a single clade with an age between 5.49 and 13.8 Ma, whereas a second independent colonization corresponding to P. darwini from San Cristóbal island occurred 3.03 Ma ago. The species from Wolf island, P. gilberti, stems from a more recent colonization event (0.69 Ma). Thus, present diversity of Galápagos leaf-toed geckos stems from three independent, asynchronous colonization events. As with other Galápagos organisms, the Pacific coast of South America seems to be the source for the founders of P. gilberti. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Phaedranassa schizantha (Amaryllidaceae) is an endangered species endemic to Ecuador and two varieties have been described: P. schizantha var. schizantha and P. schizantha var. ignea. We assessed population genetic structure and demographic patterns in 11 populations across the range of the species using 13 microsatellite loci. Our data show that genetic diversity was generally lower in the southern part of the range and was especially low in populations closest to cities. We found significant population differentiation (FST = 0.14, DEST = 0.34) and evidence of a genetic bottleneck. Genetic variation did not show isolation by distance. Instead, results suggest genetic barriers around two main cities. Bayesian analysis identified two genetic groups, neither of which represents either of the two varieties previously recognized. Coalescent analysis indicates a relatively recent colonization pattern between the two genetic groups (< 3000 generations). Conservation efforts need to be taken to facilitate genetic exchange between the groups, especially between locations that seem to be genetically isolated. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London","The geographic distribution of Octopus mimus Gould, 1852 is unclear, as most records are restricted to coastal localities of Peru and Chile, and some references have mentioned its presence off Central America. It is unknown whether this octopus is found off Ecuador as two previous unpublished records have suggested. The aim of the present study is to identify genetically the main octopus captured in a marine protected area known as Reserva de Produccion Faunistica Marino-Costera Puntilla de Santa Elena (REMACOPSE) off the Santa Elena peninsula, Ecuador. Samples collected from the local fishery were used to test the presence of this species based on the sequences of three mitochondrial markers and using a Bayesian approach. The phylogenetic analysis confirms that O. mimus inhabits the REMACOPSE. The results also indicate that the octopus specimens captured in the fishery from this marine protected area, are more closely related to O. mimus specimens from Central America than those from South America. The genetic identification of two groups of O. mimus could be associated with the different marine environmental conditions of the two biogeographic provinces. The finding in this study represents an important step for posterior research on the biology and fishery of octopus in Ecuador.","Interspecific phylogenetic relationships in the Neotropical orchid genus Mormodes were assessed by means of maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian inference (BI) analyses of non-coding nuclear ribosomal (nrITS) and plastid (trnL–trnF) DNA sequences and 24 morphological characters for 36 species of Mormodes and seven additional outgroup species of Catasetinae. The bootstrap (>50%) consensus trees of the MP analyses of each separate dataset differed in the degree of resolution and overall clade support, but there were no contradicting groups with strong bootstrap support. MP and BI combined analyses recovered similar relationships, with the notable exception of the BI analysis not resolving section Mormodes as monophyletic. However, sections Coryodes and Mormodes were strongly and weakly supported as monophyletic by the MP analysis, respectively, and each has diagnostic morphological characters and different geographical distribution. The geographic structure reflected by the recovered phylogenetic patterns suggests that it is possible to undertake taxonomic revision of regional clades, which eventually will lead to a thorough revision of the genus. © 2016 Magnolia Press.","Genomic tools allow the study of the whole genome, and facilitate the study of genotype-environment combinations and their relationship with phenotype. However, most genomic prediction models developed so far are appropriate for Gaussian phenotypes. For this reason, appropriate genomic prediction models are needed for count data, since the conventional regression models used on count data with a large sample size (nT) and a small number of parameters (p) cannot be used for genomic-enabled prediction where the number of parameters (p) is larger than the sample size (nT). Here, we propose a Bayesian mixed-negative binomial (BMNB) genomic regression model for counts that takes into account genotype by environment (G×E) interaction. We also provide all the full conditional distributions to implement a Gibbs sampler. We evaluated the proposed model using a simulated data set, and a real wheat data set from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and collaborators. Results indicate that our BMNB model provides a viable option for analyzing count data. © 2016 Montesinos-López et al.","Comparative phylogeography allow us to understand how shared historical circumstances have shaped the formation of lineages, by examining a broad spectrum of co-distributed populations of different taxa. However, these types of studies are scarce in the Neotropics, a region that is characterized by high diversity, complex geology, and poorly understood biogeography. Here, we investigate the diversification patterns of five lineages of amphibians and reptiles, co-distributed across the Choco and Andes ecoregions in northwestern Ecuador. Mitochondrial DNA and occurrence records were used to determine the degree of geographic genetic divergence within species. Our results highlight congruent patterns of parapatric speciation and common geographical barriers for distantly related taxa. These comparisons indicate similar biological and demographic characteristics for the included clades, and reveal the existence of two new species of Pristimantis previously subsumed under P. walkeri, which we describe herein. Our data supports the hypothesis that widely distributed Chocoan taxa may generally experience their greatest opportunities for isolation and parapatric speciation across thermal elevational gradients. Finally, our study provides critical information to predict which unstudied lineages may harbor cryptic diversity, and how geology and climate are likely to have shaped their evolutionary history. © 2016 Arteaga et al.

Yet, the lack of a robust phylogenetic framework for Catasetinae has hampered deeper insights in origin and evolution of sexual systems. To investigate the origins of protandry and ESD in Catasetinae, we sequenced nuclear and chloroplast loci from 77 species, providing the most extensive data matrix of Catasetinae available so far with all major lineages represented. We used Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian methods to infer phylogenetic relationships and evolution of sexual systems. Irrespectively of the methods used, Catasetinae were monophyletic in molecular phylogenies, with all established generic lineages and their relationships resolved and highly supported. According to comparative reconstruction approaches, the last common ancestor of Catasetinae was inferred as having bisexual flowers (i.e., lacking protandry and ESD as well), and protandry originated once in core Catasetinae (comprising Catasetum, Clowesia, Cycnoches, Dressleria and Mormodes). In addition, three independent gains of ESD are reliably inferred, linked to corresponding loss of protandry within core Catasetinae. Thus, prior gain of protandry appears as the necessary prerequisite for gain of ESD in orchids. Our results contribute to a comprehensive evolutionary scenario for sexual systems in Catasetinae and more generally in orchids as well. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Previous studies have shown that a 64-kDa antigen (p64) that was purified from the Venezuelan TeAp-N/D1 isolate of Trypanosoma (Trypanozoon) equiperdum corresponds to the soluble form of its predominant variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), and exhibited cross-reactivity with Trypanosoma (Duttonella) vivax. The course of experimental acute infections of bovines with T. vivax were followed by measuring whole anti-p64 antibodies and specific anti-p64 IgG and IgM antibodies in animal sera by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The value of p64 to diagnose bovine trypanosomosis was also examined using 350 sera from healthy and T. vivax-infected cows living in a trypanosomosis-endemic and enzootic stable area, and 48 sera obtained during a trypanosomosis outbreak. Serological assays showed that ~70-80% of the infected sera contained anti-p64 antibodies, based on the comparative immunodetection of the T. equiperdum clarified antigenic fraction used as a reference test. In the absence of a gold standard, Bayesian analysis for multiple testing estimated a sensitivity and specificity of 71.6% and 98.8%, respectively, for the indirect ELISA using p64 as antigen. An apparent prevalence of 37.7% for bovine trypanosomosis infection was also estimated with a Bayesian approach when the p64 ELISA test was used. Employing blood from acute infected cows, the indirect ELISA response against p64 was contrasted with the microhematocrit centrifuge method and analyses by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers targeting the inter-specific length variation of the internal transcribed spacer 1 region of the 18S ribosomal gene. The efficiency of p64 for the detection of anti-trypanosome antibodies in acute infected bovines was also corroborated serologically by comparing its response to that of the Indonesian Trypanosoma evansi Rode Trypanozoon antigen type (RoTat) 1.2 VSG, which possesses high specificity and sensitivity. As expected, PCR was the best method to detect parasites and diagnose bovine trypanosomosis; however, a substantial level of concordance (Cohen's κ = 0.667) was obtained when serological tests using p64 and RoTat 1.2 VSG were compared. Additionally, an agglutination assay was designed using p64 covalently coupled to carboxylate-modified latex microparticles, which was proven here to be suitable for a fast qualitative diagnosis of bovine trypanosomosis. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","The taxonomy of the species-rich and widespread Rhamnus s.l. is partially unresolved.

Rhamnus, remains unclear. In order to clarify the taxonomy of Rhamnus, we present the largest molecular dataset available to date, including ITS and trnL-trnF sequences of 103 species. fasttree-like searches, maximum likelihood estimates and Bayesian analyses were performed and compared. Our results are congruent across all analyses and show that the current subdivision of Rhamnus s.l. should be extended from two (Frangula, Rhamnus) to four distinct genera. First, we exclude six species from Rhamnus and attribute them to the new genus Ventia. Second, we raise the entire Rhamnus sect. Oreoherzogia to generic level.

Adults of these species inhabit the intestine of cormorants of the genus Nannopterum, whereas larval forms (metacercariae) are found in the eyes (vitreous humor) of freshwater fishes. Records of both species have been established across a wide geographic range in the Americas. Diplostomid adults and metacercariae were collected from a wide geographical range that spans from south-eastern Mexico, southwards to Central and South America. Even though the diplostomid has been largely reported in Mexico as Diplostomum (Austrodiplostomum) compactum, our specimens were identified morphologically as A. ostrowskiae. Sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase (cox 1) were obtained for 86 individuals, including 15 adults recovered from the intestine of Nannopterum brasilianus, in five localities, and 71 metacercariae from the eyes of ten fish species, in 13 localities. Sequences were used to evaluate the genetic diversity, and to test conspecificity of these specimens with the available sequence of A. ostrowskiae. Sequences were aligned with another 12 taxa representing five genera of Diplostomatidae, forming a dataset of 104 taxa with 478 nucleotides. The genetic divergence estimated among the 86 sequenced individuals, and that of A. ostrowskiae from the double-crested cormorant, Nannopterum auritus, in the USA, was very low, ranging from 0 to 0.8%. The maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian consensus trees showed that all sequences nested within a monophyletic lineage, with strong bootstrap and Bayesian posterior probability support values (100/1.0). In conclusion, a link between the metacercariae in fish and the adults in cormorants was established, indicating also that a single species is found in the distribution range comprising southern USA, southwards to Venezuela. Previous records of this species, particularly from Mexico, need to be corrected. © 2015 Cambridge University Press.","Evaluating potential effects of conservation and management actions in marine reserves requires an understanding not only of the biological processes in the reserve, and between the reserve and the surrounding ocean, but also of the effects of the wildlife on the wider political and economic processes. Such evaluations are made considerably more difficult in the absence of good ecological data from within reserves or consistent data between reserves and the wider marine environment, as is the case in much of mainland Ecuador. We present an approach to evaluate the effects of a wide range of possible management processes on the marine ecology of the Machalilla National Park, as well as that of the surrounding marine environments (including recently established reserves) and related socio-economic pressures. The approach is based on Bayesian belief networks, and as such can be used in the presence of sparse data from multiple and disparate sources. We show that currently there are no observable benefits of marine reserves to reef and fish community structure, and that high value (normally predatory) fish, which are sought by fishers and shark finners are frequently absent from reef systems. We demonstrate that there is broad similarity in ecological communities between most shallow marine systems, in or out of marine reserves, and predict there can be a strong effect from actions outside the reserve on what is present within it. We also show that establishing a stronger link between (responsible) ecotourism and the marine environment could reduce the need for income in other more destructive areas, such as fishing and particularly shark finning, and discuss ways that high value, low impact eco-tourism could be introduced. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","While divergent ecological adaptation can drive speciation, understanding the factors that facilitate or constrain this process remains a major goal in speciation research. Here, we study two mimetic transition zones in the poison frog Ranitomeya imitator, a species that has undergone a Müllerian mimetic radiation to establish four morphs in Peru. We find that mimetic morphs are strongly phenotypically differentiated, producing geographic clines with varying widths. However, distinct morphs show little neutral genetic divergence, and landscape genetic analyses implicate isolation by distance as the primary determinant of among-population genetic differentiation. Mate choice experiments suggest random mating at the transition zones, although certain allopatric populations show a preference for their own morph. We present evidence that this preference may be mediated by color pattern specifically. These results contrast with an earlier study of a third transition zone, in which a mimetic shift was associated with reproductive isolation. Overall, our results suggest that the three known mimetic transition zones in R. imitator reflect a speciation continuum, which we have characterized at the geographic, phenotypic, behavioral, and genetic levels. We discuss possible explanations for variable progress toward speciation, suggesting that multifarious selection on both mimetic color pattern and body size may be responsible for generating reproductive isolation. © 2015 by The University of Chicago.

A very important aspect for stock assessment and fisheries management is the species' individual growth. In this paper U. occidentalis growth in males and females was determined by indirect methods and the multi-model approach. By Kernel density estimators size frequency distributions were built, separating their Gaussian components by the Bhattacharya's method. Using modal progression, the cohorts were identified, and one was selected to apply asymptotic, non-asymptotic, and Schnute's versatile growth models. The best fit model was selected using the Akaike and Bayesian weights. Case 1 of Schnute was the winner model in both sexes, asymptotic in males with L∞ = 93.62 mm cephalothorax width (CW), k = 0.57 year-1 and t0 =-0.02 year-1, but it was non-asymptotic for females with an inflexion point in 2.49 years that corresponded to 73.72 mm CW. The type of individual growth of this species varies between sexes, which may be linked to reproductive issues; however, we should consider the data source and their impact on the interpretations that we can draw about individual growth.

First, classical learning algorithms, as PC or K2 are reviewed. But the problem with these general learning procedures comes from the presence of a high number of variables that measure different aspects of the same concept, as it can be the case of socio-economic indicators in a population. In this case, we have that all the variables have some degree of dependence among them, without a true causal structure. So, a new procedure is presented which makes a hierarchical clustering of the data while learning a joint probability distribution. It generalizes AutoClass EM clustering allowing more complex models. Hierarchical clustering is compared in the experiments with classical learning algorithms showing a similar performance when considering the estimation of a joint probability distribution for all the variables, but with a clear advantage: the simplicity and easiness of the interpretation of the model. The method is applied to the analysis of two datasets of the educational data: socio-economic, academic achievement and drop outs at the Engineering Faculty of Quevedo State Technical University, and student evaluation of teachers from Gazi University in Ankara (Turkey). © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

T. ventricosus and L. variegatus are associated with seagrass beds, while the other three species usually inhabit hardground substrates. Food preferences of these species are well documented and they are commonly accepted as being primarily herbivorous-omnivorous; nevertheless, few of them have previously been characterized isotopically. We used this approach for assessing the isotopic characterization of five echinoids. We established the trophic position of two groups of co-occurring species and quantified the contribution of food resources in the diet of Echinometra lucunter, considered the most common sea urchin in the Caribbean region. The species T. ventricosus and D. antillarum showed the highest values of δ15N. Sea urchins exhibited similar values of δ13C varying from -11.6 ± 0.63 to -10.4 ± 0.99%. The echinoid E. lucunter displayed the lowest values of carbon, from -15.40 ± 0.76%. Significant differences among species were found for δ15N and δ13C. Seaweed communities exhibited no differences among sites for overall δ15N (F= 1.300, df= 3, p= 0.301), but we found spatial differences for δ13C (F= 7.410, df= 3, p= 0.001). The ellipse-based metrics of niche width analysis found that the hardground biotope species (D. antillarum, E. lucunter, and E. viridis) did not overlap each other. Similar results were obtained for the co-occurring species of the seagrass biotope; however, the distance between these species was closer than that of the hardground biotope species. The Bayesian mixing models run for E. lucunter at all four localities found differences in food resources contribution. The algae D. menstrualis, C. crassa and B. triquetrum dominated in CGD; whereas C. nitens, Gracilaria spp., and D. caribaea represented the main contributor algae to the diet of E. lucunter at LQY. In Culebra Island, no dominance of any particular algae was detected in TMD, where six of the eight species exhibited a similar contribution. Similarities in δ15N between D. antillarum and T. ventricosus may hint towards a similar trophic level for these species, although T. ventricosus is widely accepted as an omnivore, while D. antillarum is considered a generalist herbivore. The lack of overlap among species in the two biotopes seems to indicate a resource partitioning strategy to avoid niche competition among co-occurring species. © 2016 Universidad de Costa Rica.

Knowing the probability of droughts might help to optimize a priori the planning and management of the water resources in general and of the Andean watersheds in particular. This study compares Markov chain- (MC) and Bayesian network- (BN) based models in drought forecasting using a recently developed drought index with respect to their capability to characterize different drought severity states. The copula functions were used to solve the BNs and the ranked probability skill score (RPSS) to evaluate the performance of the models. Monthly rainfall and streamflow data of the Chulco River basin, located in Southern Ecuador, were used to assess the performance of both approaches. Global evaluation results revealed that the MC-based models predict better wet and dry periods, and BN-based models generate slightly more accurately forecasts of the most severe droughts. However, evaluation of monthly results reveals that, for each month of the hydrological year, either the MC- or BN-based model provides better forecasts. The presented approach could be of assistance to water managers to ensure that timely decision-making on drought response is undertaken. © 2016 by the authors.","Most otariids have colony-specific foraging areas during the breeding season, when they behave as central place foragers. However, they may disperse over broad areas after the breeding season and individuals from different colonies may share foraging grounds at that time. Here, stable isotope ratios in the skull bone of adult Galapagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki) were used to assess the long-Term fidelity of both sexes to foraging grounds across the different regions of the Galapagos archipelago. Results indicated that the stable isotope ratios (δ13C and δ15N) of sea lion bone significantly differed among regions of the archipelago, without any significant difference between sexes and with a non significant interaction between sex and region. Moreover, standard ellipses, estimated by Bayesian inference and used as a measure of the isotopic resource use area at the population level, overlapped widely for the sea lions from the southern and central regions, whereas the overlap of the ellipses for sea lions from the central and western regions was small and nonexisting for those from the western and southern regions. These results suggest that males and females from the same region within the archipelago use similar foraging grounds and have similar diets. Furthermore, they indicate that the exchange of adults between regions is limited, thus revealing a certain degree of foraging philopatry at a regional scale within the archipelago. The constraints imposed on males by an expanded reproductive season (~ 6 months), resulting from the weak reproductive synchrony among females, and those imposed on females by a very long lactation period (at least one year but up to three years), may explain the limited mobility of adult Galapagos sea lions of both sexes across the archipelago. © 2016 Drago et al.

First, a hidden Markov model is used to diagnose four states that play distinct roles in the December-May rainy season. The estimated daily states fall into two wet states, one dry state, and one transitional dry-wet state, and show a systematic seasonal evolution together with intraseasonal and interannual variability. The first wet state represents regionwide wet conditions, while the second one represents north-south gradients. The former could be associated with the annual moisture offshore of the PAEP, thermally driven by the climatological maximum of sea surface temperatures in the Niño-1.2 region. The latter corresponds with the dynamically noisy component of the PAEP rainfall signal, associated with the annual displacement of the intertropical convergence zone. Then, a four-state NHMM is coupled with GCM information to simulate daily sequences at each station. Simulations of the GCM-NHMM approach represent daily rainfall characteristics at station level well. The best skills were found in reproducing the interannual variation of seasonal rainfall amount and mean intensity at the regional-averaged level with correlations equal to 0.60 and 0.64, respectively. At catchment level, the best skills appear over catchments south of 48S, where hydrologically relevant characteristics are well simulated. It is thus shown that the GCM-NHMM approach provides the potential to produce precipitation information relevant for hydrological prediction in this climate-sensitive region. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Sea urchins are important grazers and influence reef development in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP). Diadema mexicanum and Eucidaris thouarsii are the most important sea urchins on the Ecuadorian coastal reefs. This study provided a trophic scenario for these two species of echinoids in the coral-rocky reef bottoms of the Ecuadorian coast, using stable isotopes. We evaluated the relative proportion of algal resources assimilated, and trophic niche of the two sea urchins in the most southern coral-rocky reefs of the ETP in two sites with different disturbance level. Bayesian models were used to estimate the contribution of algal sources, niche breadth, and trophic overlap between the two species. The sea urchins behaved as opportunistic feeders, although they showed differential resource assimilation. Eucidaris thouarsii is the dominant species in disturbed environments; likewise, their niche amplitude was broader than that of D. mexicanum when conditions were not optimal. However, there was no niche overlap between the species. The Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR) indicated that both sea urchins shared limiting resources in the disturbed area, mainly Dictyota spp. (contributions of up to 85% for D. mexicanum and up to 75% for E. thouarsii). The Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R (SIBER) analysis results indicated less interspecific competition in the undisturbed site. Our results suggested a trophic niche partitioning between sympatric sea urchin species in coastal areas of the ETP, but the limitation of resources could lead to trophic overlap and stronger habitat degradation. © 2016 Cabanillas-Terán et al.","Classifier ensembles appeared to be powerful alternative for handling a difficult problem. It is rapidly growing and enjoying many attentions from pattern recognition and machine learning communities. In the present report, the potential of multi-criteria decision making via multiclassifier approaches is assessed by applying them in the modeling of chemicals against hyper-pigmentation. TOMOCOMD-CARDD atom-based quadratic indices are used as descriptors to parameterize the molecular structures. Support vector machine, artificial neural network, Bayesian network, binary logistic regression, instance-based learning and tree classification applied on two collected datasets are explored as standalone classifiers. Prediction sets (PSs) are used to assess the performance of multiclassifier systems (MCSs). A strategy exploiting the principal component analysis together with pairwise diversity measures is designed to select the most diverse base classifiers to combine. Various trainable and nontrainable systems are developed that aggregate, at the abstract and continuous levels, the outputs of base classifiers. The obtained results are rather encouraging since the MCSs generally enhance the performance of the base classifiers; e.g. the best MCS obtains global accuracy of 95.51%, 88.89% in the PS for the data I and II in regard to 94.12% and 85.93% of best individual classifier, respectively. Our results suggest that the MCSs could be the best choice till the moment to obtain suitable QSAR models for the prediction of depigmenting agents. Finally, we consider these approaches will aid improving the virtual screening procedures and increasing the practicality of data mining of chemical datasets for the discovery of novel lead compounds. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.","A large amount of data for inconspicuous taxa is stored in natural history collections; however, this information is often neglected for biodiversity patterns studies. Here, we evaluate the performance of direct interpolation of museum collections data, equivalent to the traditional approach used in bryophyte conservation planning, and stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs) to produce reliable reconstructions of species richness patterns, given that differences between these methods have been insufficiently evaluated for inconspicuous taxa. Our objective was to contrast if species distribution models produce better inferences of diversity richness than simply selecting areas with the higher species numbers. As model species, we selected Iberian species of the genus Grimmia (Bryophyta), and we used four well-collected areas to compare and validate the following models: 1) four Maxent richness models, each generated without the data from one of the four areas, and a reference model created using all of the data and 2) four richness models obtained through direct spatial interpolation, each generated without the data from one area, and a reference model created with all of the data. The correlations between the partial and reference Maxent models were higher in all cases (0.45 to 0.99), whereas the correlations between the spatial interpolation models were negative and weak (-0.3 to -0.06). Our results demonstrate for the first time that S-SDMs offer a useful tool for identifying detailed richness patterns for inconspicuous taxa such as bryophytes and improving incomplete distributions by assessing the potential richness of under-surveyed areas, filling major gaps in the available data. In addition, the proposed strategy would enhance the value of the vast number of specimens housed in biological collections. © 2015 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Among Neotropical lizards, the geographically widespread gymnophthalmid Cercosaura as currently defined includes lowland and highland taxa from Panama to Argentina, with some species occurring in the northern Andes. In this study we analyze three mitochondrial (12S, 16S, ND4) and one nuclear (c-mos) gene using Bayesian methods to clarify the phylogenetic relationships among most species of Cercosaura based on a well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis that also includes a large sample of other taxa within Cercosaurini. The phylogenetic tree obtained in this paper shows that Cercosaura as currently defined is not monophyletic. Two species from the northern Andes (C. dicra and C. vertebralis) are nested within Pholidobolus, which has been formerly recognized as a major radiation along the Andes of Ecuador and Colombia. Therefore, Cercosaura has probably not diversified in the northern Andes, although the phylogenetic position of C. hypnoides from the Andes of Colombia remains unknown. Tree topology and genetic distances support both recognition of C. ocellata bassleri as a distinct species, C. bassleri, and recognition of C. argula and C. oshaughnessyi as two different species. In the interest of promoting clarity and precision regarding the names of clades of gymnophthalmid lizards, we propose a phylogenetic definition of Cercosaura. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Background: Epilepsy is one of the most common signs of Neurocysticercosis (NCC). In this study, spatial and temporal variations in the incidence of hospitalized cases (IHC) of epilepsy and NCC in Ecuadorian municipalities were analyzed. Additionally, potential socio-economic and landscape indicators were evaluated in order to understand in part the macro-epidemiology of the Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis complex. Methodology: Data on the number of hospitalized epilepsy and NCC cases by municipality of residence were obtained from morbidity-hospital systems in Ecuador. SatScan software was used to determine whether variations in the IHC of epilepsy and NCC in space and time. In addition, several socio-economic and landscape variables at municipality level were used to study factors intervening in the macro-epidemiology of these diseases. Negative Binomial regression models through stepwise selection and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) were used to explain the variations in the IHC of epilepsy and NCC. Principal findings: Different clusters were identified through space and time. Traditional endemic zones for NCC and epilepsy, recognized in other studies were confirmed in our study. However, for both disorders more recent clusters were identified. Among municipalities, an increasing tendency for IHC of epilepsy, and a decreasing tendency for the IHC of NCC were observed over time. In contrast, within municipalities a positive linear relationship between both disorders was found. An increase in the implementation of systems for eliminating excrements would help to reduce the IHC of epilepsy by 1.00% (IC95%; 0.2%–1.8%) and by 5.12% (IC95%; 3.63%-6.59%) for the IHC of NCC. The presence of pig production was related to IHC of NCC. Conclusion/Significance: Both disorders were related to the lack of an efficient system for eliminating excrements. Given the appearance of recent epilepsy clusters, these locations should be studied in depth to discriminate epilepsies due to NCC from epilepsies due to other causes. Field studies are needed to evaluate the true prevalence of cysticercosis in humans and pigs in different zones of the country in order to better implement and manage prevention and/or control campaigns. © 2015 Ron-Garrido et al.","We assessed the conservation status of the three Mexican Paraphlebia damselflies based on the criterion B of the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN): P. hyalina, P. quinta, and P. zoe. According to this List, P. hyalina has not been evaluated, P. quinta appears as least concern, and P. zoe appears as Vulnerable. Geographical records were taken from literature, enquiries to specialists and field visits. We also projected the future potential geographical range area. We generated species distribution models (SDM) for P. quinta and P. zoe (as there were not enough records for P. hyalina) as a surrogate of the extension of occurrence (EOO) and also calculated the area of occupancy. Future distributions were projected for years 2020, 2050, and, 2080 based on predicted changes in climatic conditions. Species distribution models predicted current EOO areas for P. quinta and P. zoe as 18 860 and 16 440 km2, respectively, and around 50% of their distribution coincides with agricultural, pasture or urban sites. Our SDM results indicate that IUCN-based conservation status of the three species should be changed as follows: P. quinta and P. zoe moved to endangered category, and P. hyalina to data-deficient category based on the reduced EOO areas and the historical loss of habitat. For P. quinta, future climatic projections suggest an initial reduction (2020) followed by an expansion (2050 and 2080) in suitable areas, whereas for P. zoe there will be a decrease in predicted area for the three time periods. Preserving areas that provide shade, high humidity and perching sites seems to be a key for Paraphlebia species survival. © 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.","Economic growth is often based on the intensification of crop production, energy consumption and urbanization. In many cases, this leads to the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Modelling water resources and the related identification of key drivers of change are essential to improve and protect water quality in river basins. This study evaluates the potential of Bayesian belief network models to predict the ecological water quality in a typical multifunctional and tropical river basin. Field data, expert knowledge and literature data were used to develop a set of Bayesian belief network models. The developed models were evaluated based on weighted Cohen's Kappa (κw), percentage of correctly classified instances (CCI) and spherical payoff. On top, a sensitivity analysis and practical simulation tests of the two most reliable models were performed. Cross-validation based on κw (Model 1: 0.44±0.08; Model 2: 0.44±0.11) and CCI (Model 1: 36.3±2.3; Model 2: 41.6±2.3) indicated that the performance was reliable and stable. Model 1 comprised of input variables main land use, elevation, sediment type, chlorophyll, flow velocity, dissolved oxygen, and chemical oxygen demand; whereas Model 2 did not include dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand. Although the predictive performance of Model 2 was slightly higher than that of Model 1, simulation outcomes of Model 1 were more coherent. Additionally, more management options could be evaluated with Model 1. As the model's ability to simulate management outcomes is of utmost importance in model selection, Model 1 is recommended as a tool to support decision-making in river management. Model predictions and sensitivity analysis indicated that flow velocity is the major variable determining ecological water quality and suggested that construction of additional dams and water abstraction within the basin would have an adverse effect on water quality. Although a case study in a single river basin is presented, the modelling approach can be of general use on any other river basin. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aim: The subduction of the Nazca Plate and the eastward propagation of the Andean orogenic wedge in western Amazonia caused the formation of arches or ridges that have influenced the modern configuration of the upper Amazon drainage and the diversification of biota. We used a lineage of 15 palm species (Astrocaryum sect. Huicungo, Arecaceae) to test two biogeographical hypotheses for lowland plants: (1) that vicariance resulted from tectonically mediated geographical barriers (population contraction), and (2) that recurrent dispersal events (population expansion) produced geographical isolation and subsequent speciation. Location: Rain forests of South America. Methods: A total of 78 palm individuals were collected in the field, from which five chloroplast and two nuclear DNA fragments were sequenced. We reconstructed a Bayesian dated phylogeny and inferred the demographic history. We used a Bayesian phylogeographical spatial diffusion approach to propose a model of colonization. Results: We found a phylogeographical break at c. 5° S between two main clades with crown ages of c. 6.7 and 7.3 Ma located in the Fitzcarrald Arch (FA) and the subsiding northern Amazonian foreland basin (NAFB), respectively. These diversification times were close to the emergence of the FA in the late Miocene, and the coeval development of the transcontinental modern drainage and sedimentation plain of the NAFB. As expected for the recurrent-dispersal hypothesis, lineage delimitations were spatially inconsistent with the location of rivers or ridges, and we found some evidence of past ancestral population expansion supported particularly by the chloroplast sequences. Main conclusions: Our results support the biogeographical scenario whereby recurrent dispersal into western Amazonia produced spatial isolation of populations, followed by speciation within two areas of contrasting geological activity: tectonic uplift in the FA versus subsidence in the NAFB. We did not test and cannot rule out ecological speciation within western Amazonia or at finer spatial scales. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Background and Aims Date palms (Phoenix dactylifera, Arecaceae) are of great economic and ecological value to the oasis agriculture of arid and semi-arid areas. However, despite the availability of a large date palm germplasm spreading from the Atlantic shores to Southern Asia, improvement of the species is being hampered by a lack of information on global genetic diversity and population structure. In order to contribute to the varietal improvement of date palms and to provide new insights on the influence of geographic origins and human activity on the genetic structure of the date palm, this study analysed the diversity of the species. Methods Genetic diversity levels and population genetic structure were investigated through the genotyping of a collection of 295 date palm accessions ranging from Mauritania to Pakistan using a set of 18 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and a plastid minisatellite. Key Results Using a Bayesian clustering approach, the date palm genotypes can be structured into two different gene pools: the first, termed the Eastern pool, consists of accessions from Asia and Djibouti, whilst the second, termed the Western pool, consists of accessions from Africa. These results confirm the existence of two ancient gene pools that have contributed to the current date palm diversity. The presence of admixed genotypes is also noted, which points at gene flows between eastern and western origins, mostly from east to west, following a human-mediated diffusion of the species. Conclusions This study assesses the distribution and level of genetic diversity of accessible date palm resources, provides new insights on the geographic origins and genetic history of the cultivated component of this species, and confirms the existence of at least two domestication origins. Furthermore, the strong genetic structure clearly established here is a prerequisite for any breeding programme exploiting the effective polymorphism related to each gene pool. © 2015 The Author.

Here, we examine historical demographic trends for six species of milksnake with representatives in both the temperate and tropical Americas to determine if species share responses to climate change as a taxon or by area (i.e., temperate versus tropical environments). Using a multilocus dataset, we test for the demographic signature of population expansion and decline using non-genealogical summary statistics, as well as coalescent-based methods. In addition, we determine whether range sizes are correlated with effective population sizes for milksnakes. Results indicate that there are no identifiable trends with respect to demographic response based on location, and that species responded to changing climates independently, with tropical taxa showing greater instability. There is also no correlation between range size and effective population size, with the largest population size belonging to the species with the smallest geographic distribution. Our study highlights the importance of not generalizing the demographic histories of taxa by region and further illustrates that the New World tropics may not have been a stable refuge during the Pleistocene. © 2015 Ruane et al.

Despite its cultural and commercial significance, limited information exists with regards to the degree of genetic variation and ecological history of P. serotina in Ecuador. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the degree of genetic diversity and population structure of Ecuadorian P. serotina, as a preliminary step towards understanding the distribution history of this species in Ecuador and establishing germplasm conservation programs. P. serotina samples (217, representing 8 provinces from the Ecuadorian highlands) were characterized using 8 heterologous SSR markers derived from related Prunus species. Expected heterozygosity across samples (He=0.71) reveals a moderate level of genetic diversity for Ecuadorian P. serotina. Nevertheless, simple allele-count analysis indicates that Ecuadorian capuli has a narrower degree of allelic richness relative to collections from the species' center of origin in North America. Furthermore, pairwise F statistics (0.0069≤Fst≤0.0319) and Nei genetic distance estimates (0.02≤Ds≤0.09) indicate minimal population differentiation within Ecuadorian capuli. However, Bayesian population structure analysis suggests a subtle genetic contrast between germplasm from the Northern and Southern highlands. Certainly, it is of interest to analyze whether this underlying genetic differentiation between the Northern- and Southern-Highland groups is also manifested in morphological, agronomic or other phenotypic characters that could indicate adaptive differences to divergent agro-ecosystems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Knowing how migratory pelagic predators use food web resources during early life stages is essential for understanding population dynamics and recruitment. Feeding habits of ∼3 to 4 mo old Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT) Thunnus thynnus from 2 Mediterranean nearshore areas (Cartagena and Cambrils, Spain) showing distinct oceanographic features were investigated using stomach-content (SCA) and stable-isotope (SIA) analyses. SCA showed diet variability between areas and years; further correspondence analysis revealed that epipelagic fishes (primarily anchovy and sardine) constitute the staple diet of age-0 ABFT in Cambrils, whereas mesopelagic fishes (especially myctophids) and squid were consumed in significant amounts by ABFT in Cartagena. δ13C values differed significantly between tissues (white muscle and liver), areas and years (2009 and 2010), while δ15N values were not significantly different. In all cases, mean δ13C values were significantly higher in muscle than in liver, while differences in δ13C between locations and years were also observed in some instances. Estimations of trophic niche width using the antilogarithm of Shannon's entropy, exp(H), and from stable isotope Bayesian ellipses, SEAc, indicated that niche width was generally larger in samples from Cambrils than in those from Cartagena. Moreover, SEAc analysis suggested that trophic niches were broader in 2010 than in 2009. Our results indicate a low degree of feeding specialisation and suggest that, like older classes, age-0 ABFT rely on a wide prey range, easily adapting their foraging behaviour to prey availability and distribution in the habitat. This research assesses the potential of using stable isotope techniques combined with SCA for the characterization of spatio-temporal variability in the diet of juvenile top predators. © Inter-Research 2015.","Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in skin and bone of South American sea lions from Brazil and Uruguay were analysed to test the hypothesis that trophic overlap between the sexes is lower during the pre-breeding season than throughout the rest of the year. The isotopic values of skin and bone were used to infer the trophic relationships between the sexes during the pre-breeding period and year round, respectively. Prey species were also analysed to establish a baseline necessary for interpreting the stable isotope ratios of skin and bone. Standard ellipse areas, estimated using Bayesian inference in the SIBER routine of the SIAR package in R, suggested that males and females used a wide diversity of foraging strategies throughout the year and that no differences existed between the sexes. However, the diversity of foraging strategies was largely reduced during the pre-breeding period, with all the individuals of each sex adopting similar strategies, but with the two sexes differing considerably in stable isotope values and the ellipse areas of males and females not overlapping at all. Nevertheless, the results revealed a general increase in the consumption of pelagic prey by both sexes during the pre-breeding period. The progressive crowding of individuals in the areas surrounding the breeding rookeries during the pre-breeding period could lead to an increase in the local population density, which could explain the above reported changes. © Inter-Research 2015 · www.int-res.com.","In Ecuador, Tapirus pinchaque is considered to be critically endangered. Although the species has been registered in several localities, its geographic distribution remains unclear, and the effects of climate change and current land uses on this species are largely unknown. We modeled the ecological niche of T. pinchaque using MaxEnt, in order to assess its potential adaptation to present and future climate change scenarios. We evaluated the effects of habitat loss due by current land use, the ecosystem availability and importance of Ecuadorian System of Protected Areas into the models. The model of environmental suitability estimated an extent of occurrence for species of 21,729 km2 in all of Ecuador, mainly occurring along the corridor of the eastern Ecuadorian Andes. A total of 10 Andean ecosystems encompassed ~98% of the area defined by the model, with herbaceous paramo, northeastern Andean montane evergreen forest and northeastern Andes upper montane evergreen forest being the most representative. When considering the effect of habitat loss, a significant reduction in model area (~17%) occurred, and the effect of climate change represented a net reduction up to 37.86%. However, the synergistic effect of both climate change and habitat loss, given current land use practices, could represent a greater risk in the short-term, leading to a net reduction of 19.90 to 44.65% in T. pinchaque's potential distribution. Even under such a scenarios, several Protected Areas harbor a portion (~36 to 48%) of the potential distribution defined by the models. However, the central and southern populations are highly threatened by habitat loss and climate change. Based on these results and due to the restricted home range of T. pinchaque, its preference for upland forests and paramos, and its small estimated population size in the Andes, we suggest to maintaining its current status as Critically Endangered in Ecuador. © 2015 Ortega-Andrade et al.","A new flavivirus, Ecuador Paraiso Escondido virus (EPEV), named after the village where it was discovered, was isolated from sand flies (Psathyromyia abonnenci, formerly Lutzomyia abonnenci) that are unique to the New World. This represents the first sand fly-borne flavivirus identified in the New World. EPEV exhibited a typical flavivirus genome organization. Nevertheless, the maximum pairwise amino acid sequence identity with currently recognized flaviviruses was 52.8%. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete coding sequence showed that EPEV represents a distinct clade which diverged from a lineage that was ancestral to the nonvectored flaviviruses Entebbe bat virus, Yokose virus, and Sokoluk virus and also the Aedes-associated mosquito-borne flaviviruses, which include yellow fever virus, Sepik virus, Saboya virus, and others. EPEV replicated in C6/36 mosquito cells, yielding high infectious titers, but failed to reproduce either in vertebrate cell lines (Vero, BHK, SW13, and XTC cells) or in suckling mouse brains. This surprising result, which appears to eliminate an association with vertebrate hosts in the life cycle of EPEV, is discussed in the context of the evolutionary origins of EPEV in the New World. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.","This paper presents a novel model to estimate human activities — a human activity is defined by a set of human actions. The proposed approach is based on the usage of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Bayesian inference through the continuous monitoring of human actions and its surrounding environment. In the current work human activities are inferred considering not only visual analysis but also additional resources; external sources of information, such as context information, are incorporated to contribute to the activity estimation. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the way the information is encoded, so that it can be later associated according to a predefined semantic structure. Hence, a pattern representing a given activity can be defined by a set of actions, plus contextual information or other kind of information that could be relevant to describe the activity. Experimental results with real data are provided showing the validity of the proposed approach. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","RATIONALE The feeding success of predators is associated with the competition level for resources, and, thus, sympatric species are exposed to a potential trophic overlap. Isotopic Bayesian mixing models should provide a better understanding of the contribution of preys to the diet of predators and the feeding behavior of a species over time. METHODS The carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures from pup hair samples of 93 Galapagos sea lions and 48 Galapagos fur seals collected between 2003 and 2009 in different regions (east and west) of the archipelago were analyzed. A PDZ Europa ANCA-GSL elemental analyzer interfaced with a PDZ Europa 20-20 continuous flow gas source mass spectrometer was employed. Bayesian models, SIAR and SIBER, were used to estimate the contribution of prey to the diet of predators, the niche breadth, and the trophic overlap level between the populations. RESULTS Statistical differences in the isotopic values of both predators were observed over the time. The mixing model determined that Galapagos fur seals had a primarily teutophagous diet, whereas the Galapagos sea lions fed exclusively on fish in both regions of the archipelago. The SIBER analysis showed differences in the trophic niche between the two sea lion populations, with the western rookery of the Galapagos sea lion being the population with the largest trophic niche area. CONCLUSIONS A trophic niche partitioning between Galapagos fur seals and Galapagos sea lions in the west of the archipelago is suggested by our results. At intraspecific level, the western population of the Galapagos sea lion (ZwW) showed higher trophic breadth than the eastern population, a strategy adopted by the ZwW to decrease the interspecific competition levels in the western region.

This study was conducted (i) to establish the potential acute toxicity and the antinociceptive activity of some preparations of Cyrtopodium macrobulbon, in order to demonstrate its preclinical efficacy for treating symptoms of \"mal de orin\"; and (ii) to determine the chemical composition and quality control parameters of this medicinal orchid. Materials and methods The antinociceptive effect was assessed using the acetic acid-induced writhing and the hot-plate tests. Investigation of the acute toxicity was accomplished by the Lorke method. The organic extract (OE) was subjected to conventional phytochemical study using chromatographic conventional procedures. The volatile components profile of the species was accomplished via GC-MS analysis of HS-SPME-adsorbed compounds. Furthermore, an HPLC method to quantify ephemeranthol B (10) was developed and validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines. Microscopic anatomy studies were performed using light and scanning electron microscopies. Finally, a potential distribution map was generated using the MaxEnt modeling method. Results AE and OE were not toxic to mice since the LD50 was higher than 5000 mg/kg. OE was only active in the acetic acid-induced writhing assay at the doses of 100 and 316 mg/kg. Conventional phytochemical analysis of OE led to the isolation and characterization of n-hexacosyl-trans-p-coumarate (1), n-octacosyl-trans-p- coumarate (2), n-triacontyl-trans-p-coumarate (3), 4-methoxy-benzyl alcohol (4), 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (5), 1,5,7-trimethoxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene-2,6-diol (6), confusarin (7), gigantol (8), batatasin III (9), and ephemeranthol B (10). The major volatile components identified by HS-SPME analysis were 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone, eucalyptol (11), and isobornyl formate. An HPLC analytical method for the quantification of compound 10 in the plant was developed and fully validated for selectivity, accuracy, and precision. The microscopic studies revealed that the epidermal tissue displayed a layer of enlarged, crenate and cell thin-walled cells with a thickened cuticle; these cells are described for first time for this species. The potential distribution map generated revealed that this species is widespread in Mexico from Sinaloa to Merida states. Conclusions The results of the pharmacological studies tend to support the traditional use of Cyrtopodium macrobulbon for \"mal de orin\"; the presence of compounds 8, 9, and 11 with known antinociceptive activity might be related with the pharmacological effect demonstrated. The HPLC and microscopic analyses developed in this work will be valuable tools for quality control purposes for this plant. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Background: Previous studies have shown that haemosporidian parasites (Haemoproteus (Parahaemoproteus) and Plasmodium) infecting passerine birds have an evolutionary history of host switching with little cospeciation, in particular at low taxonomic levels (e.g., below the family level), which is suggested as the main speciation mechanism of this group of parasites. Recent studies have characterized diverse clades of haemosporidian parasites (H. (Haemoproteus) and H. (Parahaemoproteus)) infecting non-passerine birds (e.g., Columbiformes, Pelecaniiformes). Here, we explore the cospeciation history of H. (Haemoproteus) and H. (Parahaemoproteus) parasites with their non-passerine hosts. Methods. We sequenced the mtDNA cyt b gene of both haemosporidian parasites and their avian non-passerine hosts. We built Bayesian phylogenetic hypotheses and created concensus phylograms that were subsequently used to conduct cospeciation analyses. We used both a global cospeciation test, PACo, and an event-cost algorithm implemented in CoRe-PA. Results: The global test suggests that H. (Haemoproteus) and H. (Parahaemoproteus) parasites have a diversification history dominated by cospeciation events particularly at the family level. Host-parasite links from the PACo analysis show that host switching events are common within families (i.e., among genera and among species within genera), and occasionally across different orders (e.g., Columbiformes to Pelecaniiformes). Event-cost analyses show that haemosporidian coevolutionary history is dominated by host switching and some codivergence, but with duplication events also present. Genetic lineages unique to raptor species (e.g., FALC11) commonly switch between Falconiformes and Strigiformes. Conclusions: Our results corroborate previous findings that have detected a global cospeciation signal at the family taxonomic level, and they also support a history of frequent switching closer to the tips of the host phylogeny, which seems to be the main diversification mechanism of haemosporidians. Such dynamic host-parasite associations are relevant to the epidemiology of emerging diseases because low parasite host specificity is a prerequisite for the emergence of novel diseases. The evidence on host distributions suggests that haemosporidian parasites have the potential to rapidly develop novel host-associations. This pattern has also been recorded in fish-monogenean interactions, suggesting a general diversification mechanism for parasites when host choice is not restricted by ecological barriers. © 2014 Santiago-Alarcon et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","A systematic methodology for development of a set of discrete-time sequence models for batch control based on historical and online operating data is presented and investigated experimentally. The modeling is based on the two independent characteristic time dimensions of batch processing, being time within the batch and the batch number. The model set is parsimoniously parametrized as a set of local, interdependent models which are estimated from data for as few as half a dozen batches. On the basis of state space models transformed from the acquired input-output model set, the asymptotic convergence of iterative learning control is combined with the closed-loop performance of model predictive control to form an optimal controller aiming to ensure reliable and reproducible operation of the batch process. This learning model predictive controller may also be used for optimizing control through optimization of the bioreactor operations model. The modeling and preliminary control performance is demonstrated on an industrial fed-batch protein cultivation production process. The presented methods lend themselves directly for application as Process Analytical Technologies. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","We investigated the phylogenetic placement of Cyanaeorchis and selected representatives of the tribe Cymbidieae based on nuclear (ITS) and plastid (matK-trnK and rbcL) DNA sequences. Bayesian and parsimony analyses of separate and combined datasets were largely congruent with each other and showed that the Neotropical Cyanaeorchis does not belongs in the predominantly Old World subtribe Eulophiinae, where it has previously been placed. Instead, it is strongly supported as a sister to Grobya in Catasetinae. Because Catasetinae are Neotropical and there are no unequivocal morphological similarities between Cyanaeorchis and other genera in the subtribe, this relationship reflects a geographical rather than morphological similarity and suggest habitat-driven local diversification. Specimens from central Brazil formerly identified as Cyanaeorchis minor are shown to be a distinct species, described here as C. praetermissa. Niche modeling indicates that C. praetermissa and C. minor have different distributions and ecological niches, whereas a third species, C. arundinae has broader climatic tolerances and a distribution that encompasses those of the other two species. The distribution of the genus is also predicted to include Bolivia, the states of Rio de Janeiro, Espirito Santo and several areas in northeastern Brazil, from where no collections are currently known. © 2014 Magnolia Press.","This paper presents the design of an electrical energy conversion system (EECS) for the use of solar energy and its conditioning for injection of energy to the commercial power grid. A single-phase full-bridge inverter with transformerless H5 topology coupled to an LCL filter is used. The system is identified using an averaged small-signal state space model; while the used cascade control scheme is tuned by pole placement and includes a maximum power disturb-observe tracking type algorithm of that increases efficiency by operating the system at the optimum operating point of the solar panel. This design describes essential technical aspects in the components sizing and selection for experimental development, as well as the control structure design for a good performance to face systems perturbations.","Florens, Richard and Rolin (2003) proposed a specification test of a parametric hypothesis against a nonparametric one, in the framework of a Bayesian encompassing test. Building on that work, this paper elaborates the procedure under a condition of partial observability. The general procedure is illustrated with the case where only the sign is observable, and more generally when the available data come from a binary reduction of a vector of latent variables. This example is also used to point out some difficulties when implementing the proposed procedure. © 2013, Indian Statistical Institute.","Aim: We re-examine the biogeography of the leaf-toed geckos (Phyllodactylus) endemic to the Galápagos Islands. Our aim was to (1) test the multiple-colonization hypothesis against the single-colonization scenario proposed for most terrestrial organisms in the archipelago, (2) estimate the age of colonization of Phyllodactylus, and (3) evaluate the roles of dispersal and vicariance in the evolution of these lizards. Location: Galápagos archipelago, Ecuador. Methods: Phylogenetic relationships were evaluated with maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, including the estimation of divergence times and species trees. Previous biogeographical hypotheses were evaluated with tree-topology tests. Results: Our results support a multiple-colonization scenario: all but one species of Phyllodactylus in the Galápagos Islands belonged to a single radiation. The founders of this radiation colonized the archipelago 13.2 Ma when the islands currently above water had not yet emerged. Ten million years later, the ancestors of Phyllodactylus darwini colonized San Cristóbal. Main conclusions: As with other Galápagos organisms, the Pacific coast of South America seems to have been the source for the founders that led to the oldest radiation of leaf-toed geckos. Unlike most Galápagos endemics, however, P. darwini might have originated in the Andes. Our phylogenetic hypotheses and recent palaeogeographical data support both dispersal and vicariance as mechanisms leading to the radiation of leaf-toed geckos in the Galápagos Islands. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","In species differentiation, characters may not diverge synchronously, and there are also processes that shuffle character states in lineages descendant from a common ancestor. Species are thus expected to show some degree of incongruence among characters; therefore, taxonomic delimitation can benefit from integrative approaches and objective strategies that account for character conflict. We illustrate the potential of exploiting conflict for species delimitation in a study case of ground beetles of the subgenus Carabus (Mesocarabus), where traditional taxonomy does not accurately delimit species. The molecular phylogenies of four mitochondrial and three nuclear genes, cladistic analysis of the aedeagus, ecological niche divergence and morphometry of pronotal shape in more than 500 specimens of Mesocarabus show that these characters are not fully congruent. For these data, a three-step operational strategy is proposed for species delimitation by (i) delineating candidate species based on the integration of incongruence among conclusive lines of evidence, (ii) corroborating candidate species with inconclusive lines of evidence and (iii) refining a final species proposal based on an integrated characterization of candidate species based on the evolutionary analysis of incongruence. This procedure provided a general understanding of the reticulate process of hybridization and introgression acting on Mesocarabus and generated the hypothesis of seven Mesocarabus species, including two putative hybrid lineages. Our work emphasizes the importance of incorporating critical analyses of character and phylogenetic conflict to infer both the evolutionary history and species boundaries through an integrative taxonomic approach. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Biodiversity in the Tropical Andes is under continuous threat from anthropogenic activities. Projected changes in climate will likely exacerbate this situation. Using species distribution models, we assess possible future changes in the diversity and climatic niche size of an unprecedented number of species for the region. We modeled a broad range of taxa (11,012 species of birds and vascular plants), including both endemic and widespread species and provide a comprehensive estimation of climate change impacts on the Andes. We find that if no dispersal is assumed, by 2050s, more than 50% of the species studied are projected to undergo reductions of at least 45% in their climatic niche, whilst 10% of species could be extinct. Even assuming unlimited dispersal, most of the Andean endemics (comprising ~5% of our dataset) would become severely threatened (>50% climatic niche loss). While some areas appear to be climatically stable (e.g. Pichincha and Imbabura in Ecuador; and Nariño, Cauca, Valle del Cauca and Putumayo in Colombia) and hence depict little diversity loss and/or potential species gains, major negative impacts were also observed. Tropical high Andean grasslands (páramos and punas) and evergreen montane forests, two key ecosystems for the provision of environmental services in the region, are projected to experience negative changes in species richness and high rates of species turnover. Adapting to these impacts would require a landscape-network based approach to conservation, including protected areas, their buffer zones and corridors. A central aspect of such network is the implementation of an integrated landscape management approach based on sustainable management and restoration practices covering wider areas than currently contemplated. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.","Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic granulomatous disease that primarily affects lung tissue and lymph nodes (LN) in cattle, with economic impact on their productivity. Furthermore, it is potential zoonoses that may cause public health hazard. In this study, we evaluated the presence of bTB in two abattoirs: Cayambe and Pelileo countries located in the Ecuadorian provinces of Pichincha and Tungurahua, respectively. In total, 578 cattle were sampled (Cayambe 271 and Pelileo 307): 1,156 LN and 578 lung tissue samples were collected to apply in vitro culture and nested-PCR, respectively. The results determined a total apparent prevalence of 4.33 %, with 4.06 % at Cayambe's abattoir and 4.56 % at Pelileo's abattoir. Additionally, the Bayesian analysis showed a total true prevalence of 2.51 %, with 89.7 % of sensitivity and 97.6 % of specificity. The risk factors were evaluated by the use of simple logistic regressions with and without the random effect of places of origin. Associations of the origin of cattle in the selected slaughterhouses were found. The results showed an efficient method for the detection of bTB, which could identify a large number of infected animals, and the usefulness of lung tissue samples for early diagnosis of the disease was demonstrated in this study. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Ribes echinellum (Coville) Rehder (Miccosukee gooseberry; Grossulariaceae) is a Federally Threatened species known from only two localities: Jefferson County (Florida, FL) and McCormick County (South Carolina, SC). This perennial shrub, ca. 1 m tall, is deciduous, and reproduces both vegetatively (clonal growth) and sexually (seed production). Recent surveys of the FL population revealed a dramatic decline in plant numbers. To assist in conservation and management of this species in FL and SC populations, microsatellite genetic markers were used to identify genotypes and assess the genetic structure of R. echinellum. We genotyped seven microsatellite loci in 102 individuals: 74 collected in FL and 28 in SC. Unbiased heterozygosity was between 0.28 and 0.53. All seven loci were polymorphic, showing a range of 1.52-2.13 effective number of alleles per locus (mean = 1.75). The two populations of R. echinellum show low genetic diversity, especially in SC. Clonality was not widespread, but was higher in the SC population. Both populations show signatures of bottlenecks but isolation by distance was not evident. We found significant deviation from HW equilibrium, with higher number of heterozygotes than expected. However when HW test was done for the combined populations as two separate groups, only FL showed a significant HW test and for SC the test was non-significant. Bayesian analysis and FST values suggest high genetic divergence between the populations. These results are important for developing a recovery plan and an ex situ and reintroduction conservation programs. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).","Many species are altering their geographic range due to climate change creating new sympatric populations of otherwise allopatric populations. We investigated whether climate change will affect the distribution and thus the pattern of hybridization between two pairs of closely related damselfly species [Ischnura damula and I. demorsa, and I. denticollis and I. gemina (this, an endangered species)]. Thus, we estimated the strength of pre and postmating reproductive barriers between both pairs of species, and we predicted future potential distribution under four different Global Circulation Models and a realistic emissions scenario of climate change by using maximum entropy modelling technique. Our results showed that reproductive isolation (RI) is complete in I. damula × I. demorsa individuals: F1 (first generation) hybrids are produced but do not reach sexual maturation. However, RI in I. denticollis × I. gemina hybrids is high but incomplete and unidirectional: only I. gemina females produced F1 hybrids which mate with males and females of I. denticollis and between them producing BC1 (backcrosses) and F2 (second generation) viable hybrids. Maximum entropy models revealed a northern and westward shift and a general reduction of the potential geographic ranges. Based on the pattern of hybridization, for I. damula and I. demorsa there is a current threat as well as a rapid displacement and/or extinction of I. gemina by I. denticollis. However, the current pattern of extinction may not continue due to the contraction in ranges of the four species. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Objective: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is more frequently reported in men than in women; this may be due to male-biased exposure to CL vectors, female-biased resistance against the disease or both. We sought to determine whether gender-specific exposure to vector habitats explains male-biased CL incidence in two human populations of central Amazonia. Methods: We compared the CL incidence in one population of field researchers (N = 166), with similar exposure for males and females, and one population of rural settlers (N = 646), where exposure is overall male-biased. We used a combination of questionnaires and clinical data to quantify CL cases, and modelled disease incidence in a Bayesian framework. Results: There was a moderately higher incidence of CL among men than among women in both populations, but male bias decreased as exposure time increased. Disease incidence was overall higher among field researchers, suggesting that they are an important but understudied CL risk group. Conclusion: Our comparison of two contrasting populations provided epidemiological evidence that CL incidence can be male-biased even when exposure is comparable in both sexes. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Ecuador has the largest number of species by area worldwide, but also a low representation of species within its protected areas. Here, we applied systematic conservation planning to identify potential areas for conservation in continental Ecuador, with the aim of increasing the representation of terrestrial species diversity in the protected area network. We selected 809 terrestrial species (amphibians, birds, mammals, and plants), for which distributions were estimated via species distribution models (SDMs), using Maxent. For each species we established conservation goals based on conservation priorities, and estimated new potential protected areas using Marxan conservation planning software. For each selected area, we determined their conservation priority and feasibility of establishment, two important aspects in the decision-making processes. We found that according to our conservation goals, the current protected area network contains large conservation gaps. Potential areas for conservation almost double the surface area of currently protected areas. Most of the newly proposed areas are located in the Coast, a region with large conservation gaps and irreversible changes in land use. The most feasible areas for conservation were found in the Amazon and Andes regions, which encompass more undisturbed habitats, and already harbor most of the current reserves. Our study allows defining a viable strategy for preserving Ecuador's biodiversity, by combining SDMs, GIS-based decision-support software, and priority and feasibility assessments of the selected areas. This approach is useful for complementing protected area networks in countries with great biodiversity, insufficient biological information, and limited resources for conservation. © 2014 The Authors.","The New World sparrows (Emberizidae) are among the best known of songbird groups and have long-been recognized as one of the prominent components of the New World nine-primaried oscine assemblage. Despite receiving much attention from taxonomists over the years, and only recently using molecular methods, was a \"core\" sparrow clade established allowing the reconstruction of a phylogenetic hypothesis that includes the full sampling of sparrow species diversity. In this paper, we use mitochondrial DNA gene sequences from all 129 putative species of sparrow and four additional (nuclear) loci for a subset of these taxa to resolve both generic and species level relationships. Hypotheses derived from our mitochondrial (2184 base pairs) and nuclear (5705 base pairs) DNA data sets were generally in agreement with respect to clade constituency but differed somewhat with respect to among-clade relationships. Sparrow diversity is defined predominantly by eight well-supported clades that indicate a lack of monophyly for at least three currently recognized genera. Ammodramus is polyphyletic and requires the naming of two additional genera. Spizella is also polyphyletic with Tree Sparrow ( Spizella arborea) as a taxonomic \"outlier\". Pselliophorus is embedded within a larger Atlapetes assemblage and should be merged with that group. This new hypothesis of sparrow relationships will form the basis for future comparative analyses of variation within songbirds. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","We studied a population of the endangered glassfrog, Cochranella mache, at Bilsa Biological Station, northwestern Ecuador, from 2008 and 2009. We present information on annual abundance patterns, behavioral ecology, habitat use and a species distribution model performed with MaxEnt. We evaluate the importance of the National System of Protected Areas (SNAP) in Colombia and Ecuador, under scenarios of climate change and habitat loss. We predicted a restricted environmental suitability area from 48,509 Km2 to 65,147 Km2 along western Ecuador and adjacent Colombia; ��8% of the potential distribution occurs within SNAP. We examined four aspects of C. mache ecology: (1) ecological data suggests a strong correlation between relative abundance and rainfall, with a high probability to observe frogs through rainy months (February-May); (2) habitat use and the species distribution model suggest that this canopy dweller is restricted to small streams and rivulets in primary and old secondary forest in evergreen lowland and piedmont forest of western Ecuador, with predictions of suitability areas in adjacent southern Colombia; (3) the SNAP of Colombia and Ecuador harbor a minimum portion of the predicted model of distribution (,10%); and (4) synergetic effects of habitat loss and climate change reduces in about 95% the suitability areas for this endangered frog along its distributional range in Protected Areas. The resulting model allows the recognition of areas to undertake conservation efforts and plan future field surveys, as well as forecasting regions with high probability of C. mache occurrence in western Ecuador and southern Colombia. Further research is required to assess population tendencies, habitat fragmentation and target survey zones to accelerate the discovery of unknown populations in unexplored areas with high probability of suitability. We recommend that Cochranella mache must be re-categorized as \"Critically Endangered\" species in national and global status, according with criteria and sub-criteria A4, B1ab(i,ii,iii,iv),E.

It is known in three locations where it is sympatric with other Phaedranassa species. Phaedranassa viridiflora is the only species of the genus with yellow flowers. We analyzed 13 microsatellite loci to elucidate the genetic structure of the populations of P. viridiflora. Our results provided the first evidence of natural hybridization in the genus (between P. viridiflora and P. dubia in the Pululahua crater of northern Ecuador). The central and southern populations did not show hybridization. Genetic diversity was the highest in the Pululahua population. Central and southern populations have a higher proportion of clones than Pululahua. Bayesian and cluster analysis suggest that the yellow flower type evolved at least three times along the Ecuadorean Andes. In contrast to other Phaedranassa species, Phaedranassa viridiflora shows lower genetic diversity, which is likely related to a vegetative reproductive strategy. © 2013 The New York Botanical Garden (outside the USA).","Triatoma infestans, the major vector of Chagas disease south of the Amazon in South America, has a large distribution of wild populations, contrary to what has previously been stated. These populations have been suspected of being the source of reinfestation of human habitats and could impede the full success of vector control campaigns. This study examined gene flow between intra-peridomestic populations and wild populations collected in the surround areas in three Andean localities in Bolivia. The populations were defined according to temporal, ecological, and spatial criteria. After DNA extraction from the legs of each insect, the samples were analyzed using seven microsatellite markers. First, the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) detected an absence of differentiation between wild and intra-peridomestic populations, although strong structuring was observed between the populations within each environment. Then for some populations, the Bayesian method of assignment to inferred populations showed very similar assignment patterns of the members of wild or intra-peridomestic populations in each locality. Finally, the detection of the first-generation migrants within the different populations provided evidence of insect displacement from the wild to the intra-peridomestic environment. This result indicates that, after control campaigns in the Andes, controlling this new paradigm of vector transmission risk stemming from the invasion of human habitats by wild populations of T. infestans requires long-term maintenance of public monitoring to keep the risk at a minimal level. Since wild populations of T. infestans have also been detected elsewhere in Argentina, Paraguay, and Chile, there is an urgent need to take these populations into account in future monitoring of Chagas disease transmission. © 2013 Brenière et al.","There are not \"universal methods\" to determine diet composition of predators. Most traditional methods are biased because of their reliance on differential digestibility and the recovery of hard items. By relying on assimilated food, stable isotope and Bayesian mixing models (SIMMs) resolve many biases of traditional methods. SIMMs can incorporate prior information (i.e. proportional diet composition) that may improve the precision in the estimated dietary composition. However few studies have assessed the performance of traditional methods and SIMMs with and without informative priors to study the predators' diets. Here we compare the diet compositions of the South American fur seal and sea lions obtained by scats analysis and by SIMMs-UP (uninformative priors) and assess whether informative priors (SIMMs-IP) from the scat analysis improved the estimated diet composition compared to SIMMs-UP. According to the SIMM-UP, while pelagic species dominated the fur seal's diet the sea lion's did not have a clear dominance of any prey. In contrast, SIMM-IP's diets compositions were dominated by the same preys as in scat analyses. When prior information influenced SIMMs' estimates, incorporating informative priors improved the precision in the estimated diet composition at the risk of inducing biases in the estimates. If preys isotopic data allow discriminating preys' contributions to diets, informative priors should lead to more precise but unbiased estimated diet composition. Just as estimates of diet composition obtained from traditional methods are critically interpreted because of their biases, care must be exercised when interpreting diet composition obtained by SIMMs-IP. The best approach to obtain a near-complete view of predators' diet composition should involve the simultaneous consideration of different sources of partial evidence (traditional methods, SIMM-UP and SIMM-IP) in the light of natural history of the predator species so as to reliably ascertain and weight the information yielded by each method. © 2013 Franco-Trecu et al.","Electricity consumption for plugged-in electric loads (PELs) accounts for more use than any other single end-use service in residential and commercial buildings. PELs possess potentials to be efficiently managed for many purposes. However, few existing load identification methods are designed for PELs to handle challenges such as the diversity within each type of PELs and similarity between different types of PELs with similar front-end power supply units. Existing methods provide only absolute decisions which are not reliable when handling these challenges. This paper presents a simple yet efficient and practical hybrid supervised self-organizing map (SSOM)/Bayesian identifier for PELs. The proposed identifier can classify PELs into clusters by inherent similarities due to similar front-end power supply topologies, extract and utilize statistical information, and provide the probability of the unknown load belonging to a specific type of load. Tests based on real-world data validate that the proposed methods are accurate, robust, and applicable. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","Background:Triatoma dimidiata is among the main vectors of Chagas disease in Latin America. However, and despite important advances, there is no consensus about the taxonomic status of phenotypically divergent T. dimidiata populations, which in most recent papers are regarded as subspecies.Methodology and Findings:A total of 126 cyt b sequences (621 bp long) were produced for specimens from across the species range. Forty-seven selected specimens representing the main cyt b clades observed (after a preliminary phylogenetic analysis) were also sequenced for an ND4 fragment (554 bp long) and concatenated with their respective cyt b sequences to produce a combined data set totalling 1175 bp/individual. Bayesian and Maximum-Likelihood phylogenetic analyses of both data sets (cyt b, and cyt b+ND4) disclosed four strongly divergent (all pairwise Kimura 2-parameter distances >0.08), monophyletic groups: Group I occurs from Southern Mexico through Central America into Colombia, with Ecuadorian specimens resembling Nicaraguan material; Group II includes samples from Western-Southwestern Mexico; Group III comprises specimens from the Yucatán peninsula; and Group IV consists of sylvatic samples from Belize. The closely-related, yet formally recognized species T. hegneri from the island of Cozumel falls within the divergence range of the T. dimidiata populations studied.Conclusions:We propose that Groups I-IV, as well as T. hegneri, should be regarded as separate species. In the Petén of Guatemala, representatives of Groups I, II, and III occur in sympatry; the absence of haplotypes with intermediate genetic distances, as shown by multimodal mismatch distribution plots, clearly indicates that reproductive barriers actively promote within-group cohesion. Some sylvatic specimens from Belize belong to a different species - likely the basal lineage of the T. dimidiata complex, originated ∼8.25 Mya. The evidence presented here strongly supports the proposition that T. dimidiata is a complex of five cryptic species (Groups I-IV plus T. hegneri) that play different roles as vectors of Chagas disease in the region. © 2013 Monteiro et al.","We provide the first evidence of Hepatozoon parasites infecting bats.

These commercially important species occur in tropical and temperate coastal waters around the world. The taxonomy of the family has been revised a number of times in recent years, focusing in particular on genera such as Doryteuthis, Sepioteuthis, Alloteuthis, and Uroteuthis, which are represented by populations in the New World, Oceania, Europe/Africa, and Asia. However, no detailed phylogenetic analysis is available for the loliginids of the southern Atlantic, in particular the genus Doryteuthis. The present molecular study analyzed 81 loliginid taxa from around the world. The partial sequencing of the mitochondrial 16S and Cytochrome Oxidase I genes, and the nuclear rhodopsin gene revealed a number of important patterns, recovering the monophyletic status of the majority of the genera and revealing possible cryptic species in Doryteuthis plei D. pealei, Uroteuthis duvauceli and Sepioteuthis lessoniana. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Andean Pholidobolus and Macropholidus lizards contain seven and two species, respectively, as currently recognized.

The phylogenetic tree obtained in this paper includes two main clades and shows that both Pholidobolus and Macropholidus are not monophyletic. A chronophylogenetic analysis indicates that the southernmost clade, occurring in the Huancabamba Depression, diversified earlier than the northern-Andes clade.

How common is it? Where does it spend its inactive periods? These are basic questions about the biology of a species, which bring key information for application in conservation and management. Unfortunately, this information is available for only a minimum fraction of all animal species. Using 1) ecological niche modeling with maximum entropy (Maxent), 2) relative abundance estimates using museum records, and 3) field surveys of roosting sites, we report the fraternal fruit-eating bat, Artibeus fraterculus, as having a distribution limited to the Tumbesian ecoregion in Ecuador and west central Peru, being the relatively most abundant bat species throughout its range, with healthy populations which are primarily sustained by cultivated and introduced plants, and using human-made constructions as roost sites. Additionally, we described a large congregation of individuals of this species in a single roost, representing the largest colony reported for the genus Artibeus. These results may indicate resilience of A. fraterculus to human disturbance. © Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.","Premise ofthe study: This study elucidates the phylogenetic position of a unique taxon of Graphidaceae occurring on rock in coastal desert areas, assessing its importance for our understanding of the evolution of the largest family of tropical lichenized fungi. Methods: We used maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches to reconstruct a three-gene phylogeny of Graphidaceae and a Bayesian molecular clock approach to estimate divergence dates for major clades, as well as Bayesian ancestral ecogeography state analysis.Key results: The new genus Redonographa represents a new subfamily, Redonographoideae, sister to subfamily Graphidoideae. Redonographa is exclusively saxicolous and restricted to the American Pacific coast from California to central Chile, including Galapagos. It contains four species: Redonographa chilensis comb. nov., R. saxiseda comb. nov., R. saxorum comb. nov., and R. galapagoensis sp. nov. The genus Gymnographopsis, with a similar ecogeography but differing in excipular carbonization and chemistry, is also included in Redonographoideae, with the species G. chilena from Chile and G. latispora from South Africa. Molecular clock analysis indicates that Redonographoideae diverged from Graphidoideae about 132 million years ago (Ma) in the Early Cretaceous.Conclusions: The divergence date for subfamilies Redonographoideae and Graphidoideae coincides with the early breakup of Gondwana and ancient origin of the Atacama Desert. However, the common ancestor of Redonographoideae plus Graphidoideae was reconstructed to be tropical-epiphytic. Thus, even if Redonographoideae is subtropical-saxicolous, the hypothesis that Graphidoideae evolved from a subtropical-saxicolous ancestor is not supported. © 2013 Botanical Society of America.","Objective: To estimate and compare the performances of coprology, copro-Ag ELISA and real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (copro-PCR) for detection of Taenia solium tapeworm carriers. Methods: The three diagnostic tests were applied on 817 stool samples collected in two Zambian communities where taeniasis is endemic. A Bayesian approach was used to allow estimation of the test characteristics. Two (0.2%; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0-0.8), 67 (8.2%; 95% CI: 6.4-10.3) and 10 (1.2%; 95% CI: 0.5-2.2) samples were positive using coprology, copro-Ag ELISA and copro-PCR, respectively. Results: Specificities of 99.9%, 92.0% and 99.0% were determined for coprology, copro-Ag ELISA and copro-PCR, respectively. Sensitivities of 52.5%, 84.5% and 82.7% were determined for coprology, copro-Ag ELISA and copro-PCR, respectively. Conclusions: We urge for additional studies exploring possible cross-reactions of the copro-Ag ELISA and for the use of more sensitive tests, such as copro-PCR, for the detection of tapeworm carriers, which is a key factor in controlling the parasite in endemic areas. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Aim: The phylogeographical history of Neotropical species can be difficult to reconstruct because of superimposed Neogene and Quaternary histories, and because of taxonomic uncertainty. We analysed range-wide genetic diversity in a widespread pioneer tree species, Jacaranda copaia (Aubl.) D. Don, to characterize phylogeographical structure, date the evolutionary relationships among lineages, and evaluate the role of dispersal and vicariance in establishing the present geographical range. Location: Guiana Shield; central, southern and western Amazon Basin; Chocó region; Central America. Methods: We analysed nine nuclear simple sequence repeat loci (nuSSR), eight chloroplast SSRs (cpSSR), and two cpDNA intergenic sequences in 341 adult trees. Genetic differentiation at nuSSRs was inferred using Bayesian clustering. Dating of chloroplast lineage divergence was obtained using a range of published mutation rates and Bayesian coalescence analyses. Population divergence dating was performed using an isolation-with-migration model for eight loci (one cp sequence and seven nuSSRs). Results: Nuclear SSR variation identified three geographically overlapping clusters (nu-1, nu-2, nu-3). Twelve cpDNA haplotypes were clustered into two haplogroups (cp-1, cp-2) with the central Amazon harbouring the highest diversity. Molecular dating analysis suggests that cpDNA haplotype diversification started around the end of the Pliocene (2.61 Ma on average), whereas population divergence was more recent and occurred during the mid-Quaternary (point estimates between 357 and 436 ka). Main conclusions: The genetic variation of J. copaia in the Neotropics was shaped mainly by Pleistocene events. Chloroplast diversity did not display the expected cis/trans Andean disjunction, indicating recent dispersal. Nuclear variation revealed that separate regions share a recent history, with a centre of diversity in the central Amazon Basin. The geographical pattern of diversity is congruent with the distribution of the two subspecies, J. copaia copaia and J. copaia spectabilis, and evidence of nuSSR admixture between the two taxa supports their classification as subspecies. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Aim Many tropical tree species have poorly delimited taxonomic boundaries and contain undescribed or cryptic species. We examined the genetic structure of a species complex in the tree genus Carapa in the Neotropics in order to evaluate age, geographic patterns of diversity and evolutionary relationships, and to quantify levels of introgression among currently recognized species. Location Lowland moist forests in the Guiana Shield, the Central and Western Amazon Basin, Chocó and Central America. Methods Genetic structure was analysed using seven nuclear simple sequence repeats (nuSSR), five chloroplast SSRs (cpSSR), and two chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) intergenic sequences (trnH-psbA and trnC-ycf6). Bayesian clustering analysis of the SSR data was used to infer population genetic structure and to assign 324 samples to their most likely genetic cluster. Bayesian coalescence analyses were performed on the two cpDNA markers to estimate evolutionary relationships and divergence times. Results Two genetic clusters (nu_guianensis and nu_surinamensis) were detected, which correspond to the Neotropical species C. guianensis (sensu latu) and C. surinamensis. Fourteen cpDNA haplotypes clustered into six haplogroups distributed between the two nuclear genetic clusters. Divergence between the haplogroups was initiated in the Miocene, with some haplotype structure evolving as recently as the Pleistocene. The absence of complete lineage sorting between the nuclear and chloroplast genomes and the presence of hybrid individuals suggest that interspecific reproductive barriers are incomplete. NuSSR diversity was highest in C. guianensis and, within C. guianensis, cpDNA diversity was highest in the Central and Western Amazon Basin. Regional genetic differentiation was strong but did not conform to an isolation-by-distance process or exhibit a phylogeographical signal. Main conclusions The biogeographical history of Neotropical Carapa appears to have been influenced by events that took place during the Neogene. Our results point to an Amazonian centre of origin and diversification of Neotropical Carapa, with subsequent migration to the Pacific coast of South America and Central America. Gene flow apparently occurs among species, and introgression events are supported by inconsistencies between chloroplast and nuclear lineage sorting. The absence of phylogeographical structure may be a result of the ineffectiveness of geographical barriers among populations and of reproductive isolation mechanisms among incipient and cryptic species in this species complex. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Aim: The origins of much Neotropical biodiversity remain a topic of debate, with both palaeogeographical and more recent climatic drivers playing a role in diversification both among and within species. Here we use a combination of molecular data to assess genetic variation within and among species in the Neotropical tree genus Cedrela, with a focus on Cedrela odorata, to test hypotheses on the drivers of diversification, to place known ecotypic variation in context and to detect intraspecific phylogeographical structure. Location: Central and South America, Cuba, Cayman Islands, Trinidad and Guadeloupe. Methods: Samples were collected from the field, existing collections and herbaria from across the geographical range, including a total of 528 individuals from 72 sites. A phylogenetic framework was constructed using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence data (intergenic spacers plus flanking 18S and 26S regions), and genetic structure was analysed using a combination of chloroplast DNA sequences (trnC-ycf6, trnH-psbA) and chloroplast and nuclear microsatellite (single sequence repeat, SSR) loci. Phylogenetic reconstruction was undertaken using a combination of Bayesian and parsimony-based approaches; divergence times were estimated for major nodes. Geographical structure in chloroplast SSR data was analysed using SAMOVA, while that in nuclear SSR data was assessed using a combination of Bayesian clustering and principal coordinates analysis. Results: ITS sequence data supported phylogenetic distinctiveness of four morphologically cryptic species within C. odorata. Chloroplast sequence and microsatellite data showed geographical structuring both among and within species, suggesting the influence of climatic and geographical drivers. Intraspecific genetic divergence was also present in nuclear microsatellite data, suggesting contemporary gene flow limitation across sea and mountain barriers. Main conclusions: The data support diversification of the genus Cedrela in South America with subsequent recolonization into Central America prior to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. At least four morphologically cryptic taxa were evident within C. odorata and within-species phylogeographical divergence across the Andes and within Central America was present, the latter suggestive of Pleistocene climatic influence. Previously recognized ecotypes in Central America should be elevated to species level. The new molecular data support the recent reclassification and will support the monitoring of exploitation in the genus. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Habenaria is a large genus of terrestrial orchids distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The integrity and monophyly of this genus have been under discussion for many years, and at one time or another, several genera have been either included in a broadly defined Habenaria or segregated from it. In this study, the phylogenetic relationships of the Neotropical members of the genus and selected groups of African Habenaria were investigated using DNA sequences from the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the plastid matK gene sampled from 151 taxa of Habenaria from the Neotropics (ca. 51% of the total) as well as 20 species of Habenaria and Bonatea from the Old World. Bayesian and parsimony trees were congruent with each other, and in all analyses, the Neotropical species formed a highly supported group. African species of Habenaria in sections Dolichostachyae, Podandria, Diphyllae, Ceratopetalae and Bilabrellae, and the Neotropical clade formed a highly supported \" core Habenaria clade\" , which includes the type species of the genus from the New World. The topology of the trees indicates an African origin for the Neotropical clade and the low sequence divergence among the Neotropical species suggests a recent radiation of the genus in the New World. Species of Bonatea and Habenaria sections Chlorinae and Multipartitae formed a well-supported clade that was sister to the \" core Habenaria clade\" The Neotropical clade consists of at least 21 well-supported subgroups, but all Neotropical sections of the current sectional classification are paraphyletic or polyphyletic and will need extensive revision and recircumscription. Most of the Neotropical subgroups formed morphologically uniform assemblage of species, but some cases of morphological divergence within subgroups and convergence between subgroups indicated that morphology alone can be misleading for inferring relationships within the genus. The genera Bertauxia, Kusibabella and Habenella, segregated from New World Habenaria, are not monophyletic and a revision of the sectional classification rather than a generic division seems most appropriate. Our results do not support an extensive generic fragmentation of Habenaria as previously suggested and will provide a framework for revising the infrageneric classification and investigating the patterns of morphological evolution and geographical distribution of the genus in the New World. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","empty","Rhodnius barretti, a new triatomine species, is described based on adult specimens collected in rainforest environments within the Napo ecoregion of western Amazonia (Colombia and Ecuador). R. barretti resembles Rhodnius robustus s.l., but mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences reveal that it is a strongly divergent member of the “robustus lineage”, i.e., basal to the clade encompassing Rhodnius nasutus, Rhodnius neglectus, Rhodnius prolixus and five members of the R. robustus species complex. Morphometric analyses also reveal consistent divergence from R. robustus s.l., including head and, as previously shown, wing shape and the length ratios of some anatomical structures. R. barretti occurs, often at high densities, in Attalea butyracea and Oenocarpus bataua palms. It is strikingly aggressive and adults may invade houses flying from peridomestic palms. R. barretti must therefore be regarded as a potential Trypanosoma cruzi vector in the Napo ecoregion, where Chagas disease is endemic. © 2013 Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

We review the influence of geological events such as the Pebas system, the Andean uplift and the land connections between South and Central/North America, on the historical assembly of Neotropical palms. We present a case study of the palm genus Astrocaryum (40 species) as a model for evaluating colonization and diversification patterns of lowland Neotropical taxa. We conducted a Bayesian dated phylogenetic analysis based on four low-copy nuclear DNA regions and a biogeographical analysis using the dispersal, extinction and cladogenesis model. Cladogenesis of Western Amazonian Astrocaryum spp. (c.6Mya) post-dated the drainage of the aquatic Pebas system, supporting the constraining role of Pebas on in situ diversification and colonization. The ancestral distribution of Astrocaryum spp. in the Guiana Shield supported the hypothesis of an old formation that acted as a source area from which species colonized adjacent regions, but an earliest branching position for Guianan species was not confidently recovered. A twofold increase in diversification rate was found in a clade, the ancestor of which occupied the Guiana Shield (c.13Mya, a time of climatic change and Andean uplift). © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.","In this paper we discuss operational risk modeling and consider a general Bayesian context incorporating information on market risk profile, expert opinion and operational losses, taking into account the general macroeconomic environment as well. This modeling aims at estimating a characteristic parameter of the operational risk severity distribution function, using those sources of information. It generalizes under more realistic conditions a study realized by Lambrigger, Shevchenko and Wüthrich, and analyses the influence of macroeconomic effects on operational risk. Our theoretical model suggests that severities of operational losses are more related to the macroeconomic environment than usually assumed. © 2012, Incisive Media Ltd.

Factorial correspondence analysis, analysis of molecular variance, genetic distances, average number of migrants per population and Wright's F statistics were performed. Population structure was assessed by a Bayesian model, assuming an unknown number of K genetically distinct groups. The correspondence analysis showed that the populations of Guabalá and Guaymí cluster with Mexican creole cattle and Texas Longhorn. Lower genetic differentiation of Panamanian creole with Mexican and Texas Longhorn was also observed. The analyses of genetic distances have also shown similar results to those obtained by Amova and by the factorial correspondence analysis, and the less distance was observed between north populations and Panamanian ones, in comparison with southern populations. Bayesian clustering permitted the assignment of individuals to their respective groups, based on their genetic similarity, and provided information on the number of cluster from which they originate. There is a close historical, genetic, and geographic relationship of Panamanian, Mexican, and Texas Longhorn populations due to the migration of precursors from the Caribbean islands to Panama and Mexico.","The mosquito Aedes aegypti, the dengue virus vector, has spread throughout the tropics in historical times. While this suggests man-mediated dispersal, estimating contemporary connectivity among populations has remained elusive. Here, we use a large mtDNA dataset and a Bayesian coalescent framework to test a set of hypotheses about gene flow among American Ae. aegypti populations. We assessed gene flow patterns at the continental and subregional (Amazon basin) scales. For the Americas, our data favor a stepping-stone model in which gene flow is higher among adjacent populations but in which, at the same time, North American and southeastern Brazilian populations are directly connected, likely via sea trade. Within Amazonia, the model with highest support suggests extensive gene flow among major cities; Manaus, located at the center of the subregional transport network, emerges as a potentially important connecting hub. Our results suggest substantial connectivity across Ae. aegypti populations in the Americas. As long-distance active dispersal has not been observed in this species, our data support man-mediated dispersal as a major determinant of the genetic structure of American Ae. aegypti populations. The inferred topology of interpopulation connectivity can inform network models of Ae. aegypti and dengue spread. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Aim Abundance of small passerines may be distributed over large wintering areas according to geographical patterns that are difficult to detect. This may prevent the identification and conservation of the most suitable sectors, or the detection of local and regional features affecting the species during winter. In this paper, we explore the usefulness of ring recoveries to predict bird distribution in wintering grounds by using Maxent, one of the presence-only techniques available for modelling species distributions. We test whether suitability indices obtained in 2.5×2.5km UTM squares from ring recoveries were positively correlated with the actual abundance of robins (Erithacus rubecula) and blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) inside the squares. Location Spain. Methods We used 686 and 1139 localities across the country in which blackcap and robin ring recoveries were recorded by the Spanish Office of Migratory Species to generate the suitability maps. In addition, we sampled bird abundance inside 70 control squares independent of ring recovery localities along a belt crossing mountains, highlands and lowlands of the Iberian Peninsula during January from 2006 to 2011. Results Suitability indices predicted by Maxent were positively correlated with robin (r=0.42, n=70, P<0.001) and blackcap (r=0.52, n=70, P<0.001) abundances in the 70 control squares along the belt crossing the Iberian Peninsula. Main conclusions These results suggest that the use of distribution models with ring recoveries may be used to describe the habitat suitability of the winter ranges of small, common passerines. This also means that the huge number of ring recoveries stored in national and transnational data banks could be used to explore the factors shaping bird ranges and to forecast the geographical distribution of suitable wintering areas of migratory birds in large, poorly known regions. This may be useful in biogeography and conservation. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Reliable surveillance models are an important tool in public health because they aid in mitigating disease outbreaks, identify where and when disease outbreaks occur, and predict future occurrences. Although many statistical models have been devised for surveillance purposes, none are able to simultaneously achieve the important practical goals of good sensitivity and specificity, proper use of covariate information, inclusion of spatio-temporal dynamics, and transparent support to decision-makers. In an effort to achieve these goals, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal conditional autoregressive hidden Markov model with an absorbing state. The model performs well in both a large simulation study and in an application to influenza/pneumonia fatality data. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Objectives: Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are used to produce predictions of potential Leguminosae diversity in West Central Africa. Those predictions are evaluated subsequently using expert opinion. The established methodology of combining all SDMs is refined to assess species diversity within five defined vegetation types. Potential species diversity is thus predicted for each vegetation type respectively. The primary aim of the new methodology is to define, in more detail, areas of species richness for conservation planning. Methodology: Using Maxent, SDMs based on a suite of 14 environmental predictors were generated for 185 West Central African Leguminosae species, each categorised according to one of five vegetation types: Afromontane, coastal, non-flooded forest, open formations, or riverine forest. The relative contribution of each environmental variable was compared between different vegetation types using a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis followed by a post-hoc Kruskal-Wallis Paired Comparison contrast. Legume species diversity patterns were explored initially using the typical method of stacking all SDMs. Subsequently, five different ensemble models were generated by partitioning SDMs according to vegetation category. Ecological modelers worked with legume specialists to improve data integrity and integrate expert opinion in the interpretation of individual species models and potential species richness predictions for different vegetation types. Results/Conclusions: Of the 14 environmental predictors used, five showed no difference in their relative contribution to the different vegetation models. Of the nine discriminating variables, the majority were related to temperature variation. The set of variables that played a major role in the Afromontane species diversity model differed significantly from the sets of variables of greatest relative important in other vegetation categories. The traditional approach of stacking all SDMs indicated overall centers of diversity in the region but the maps indicating potential species richness by vegetation type offered more detailed information on which conservation efforts can be focused. © 2012 de la Estrella et al.","We review the systematics of frogs of the Hyloscirtus larinopygion group. A new phylogenetic tree inferred from mitochondrial DNA (partial sequences of 12S rRNA, valine-tRNA, and 16S rRNA genes; ∼2.3 kb) of eleven species of the H. larinopygion group is provided, based on maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses. Our phylogeny confirms the close relationship of members of the H. larinopygion group with Andean relatives of the H. armatus group, which also occurs in the Andes. Hyloscirtus tapichalaca is placed as sister species to the rest of the H. larinopygion group, in which two clades (A+B) are evident. Although ingroup relationships are well supported, the monophyly of the H. larinopygion group and placement of H. tapichalaca require additional testing. Genetic divergences among species of the H. larinopygion group are shallow compared to those observed in many other anurans, with genetic distance among sister species (H. princecharlesi and H. ptychodactylus) as low as 1.31%. However, this pattern is concordant with radiations in other highland Andean lineages of anurans that show marked morphological or behavioral differentiation, but low divergence in mitochondrial markers. Divergence-time analyses (using BEAST) indicate that the Hyloscirtus clade is a relatively ancient lineage that appeared in the Eocene, at a minimum age of 51.2 million years ago (MYA), while the H. larinopygion group originated in the Middle-Late Eocene at a minimum age of 40.9 MYA. Our results might suggest a rapid radiation of Hyloscirtus starting in the Miocene into the Pliocene, from at least 14.2 MYA to the most recent divergence between sister taxa at ∼2.6 MYA. We also describe two sympatric new species of Hyloscirtus from northwestern Ecuador: H. criptico sp. nov. and H. princecharlesi sp. nov. We diagnose them by their phylogenetic position (they are not sister to each other), genetic divergence, and a unique combination of color patterns, and other morphological features. Additionally, we describe the suctorial tadpoles and the extreme ontogenic color changes in H. larinopygion, H. lindae, H. pantostictus, H. princecharlesi, H. psarolaimus, and H. tigrinus. Furthermore, we describe the osteology of H. criptico, H. lindae, H. pacha, H. pantostictus, H. princecharlesi, H. psarolaimus, H. ptychodactylus, and H. staufferorum. We describe vocalizations of H. lindae, H. pacha, H. pantostictus, H. pasarolaimus, H. staufferorum, and H. tapichalaca. Hyloscirtus tigrinus is recorded for the first time in Ecuador and its range is extended 62.4 km (airline distance), from its southernmost locality record in Departamento de Nariño, Colombia. Most species of the H. larinopygion group are currently severely threatened by extinction, after surviving the catastrophic extinctions in the 1980s and 1990s that led to the disappearance of many other sympatric anurans that bred in swiftly flowing water and had lotic water tadpoles in the Andean highlands. Research and conservation actions are urgently needed for these species. In order to better call attention to these conservation issues, we name one of the new species in honor of Prince Charles of Wa l e s, who is contributing significantly to the growth of awareness in the battle against tropical deforestation, climate change, and the catastrophic extinction of rainforest amphibians.

Phaedranassa tunguraguae is an IUCN endangered plant species endemic to a single valley in the Ecuadorian Andes. We estimate the levels of genetic differentiation across the geographic distribution of P. tunguraguae using 12 microsatellite loci. We discuss factors that might influence the genetic structure of this species. Genetic distance was used to evaluate relationship among populations and geographic patterns. Bayesian methods were used to investigate population structure, migration, evidence of recent bottlenecks, and time of divergence. The 7 populations form 2 genetic clusters. These clusters show highly significant differentiation between them, along with isolation by distance. Allele richness decreases from the most diverse westernmost population to the least diverse easternmost population. The species overall shows an excess of homozygotes, with highest levels of inbreeding in the easternmost population. We found evidence of recent bottleneck events. Migration rates were in general low but were higher between populations within each of the clusters. Time of divergence between populations was related to historical volcanic activity in the area. Based on our results, we propose 2 management units for P. tunguraguae. © The American Genetic Association. 2012.

Because Marmorkrebs are parthenogenetic, they could establish a population from only a single individual, and thus pose a risk for becoming established in Japan, as they have in other countries. There are two major reasons to be concerned about the possibility of Marmorkrebs establishing viable populations in Japan. First, Japan's only endemic crayfish, Cambaroides japonicus (De Haan, 1841), lives throughout Hokkaido and is endangered. Introduced Marmorkrebs are potential competitors that could further threaten C. japonicus. Second, Marmorkrebs live in rice paddies in Madagascar and consume rice. Marmorkrebs populations could reduce rice yields in Japan.Results: We created five models in MaxEnt of the potential distribution of Marmorkrebs in Japan. All models showed eastern Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu contain suitable habitats for Marmorkrebs. Hokkaido, the main habitat for C. japonicus, contained much less suitable habitat in most models, but is where the only Marmorkrebs in Japan to date was found.Conclusions: Marmorkrebs appear to be capable of establishing populations in Japan if introduced. They appear to pose minimal threat to C. japonicus, but may negatively affect rice production. © 2012 Faulkes et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Early and accurate detection of outbreaks is one of the most important objectives of syndromic surveillance systems. We propose a general Bayesian framework for syndromic surveillance systems. The methodology incorporates Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) and spatio-temporal conditional autoregressive (CAR) modeling. By contrast, most previous approaches have been based on only spatial or time series models. The model has appealing probabilistic representations as well as attractive statistical properties. Based on extensive simulation studies, the model is capable of capturing outbreaks rapidly, while still limiting false positives. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Aim To assess the effects of altitude and historic and recent forest fragmentation on the genetic diversity and structure of the wind-pollinated tropical tree line species Polylepis incana. Location One of the highest mountain forest regions of the world, located in the Eastern Cordillera of the Ecuadorian Andes. Methods We compared genetic diversity and structure of adult trees with those of seedlings (n= 118 in both cases) in nine forest stands spanning an altitudinal gradient from 3500 to 4100m a.s.l. using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). Genetic diversity was calculated as percentage of polymorphic bands (P) and Nei's expected heterozygosity (He); genetic differentiation was assessed using analysis of molecular variance, Φ ST statistics and Bayesian cluster analysis. Results Estimates of genetic diversity at the population level were significantly lower in seedlings than in adults. Genetic diversity (He-value) was, in both cases, negatively correlated to altitude and positively correlated to population size in the seedlings. Genetic differentiation of the seedlings was approximately as high (φ ST= 0.298) as that of the adults (φ ST= 0.307), and geographical differentiation was clearly reflected in both AFLP profiles, with mountain ridges acting as barriers to gene flow. Main conclusions Our study provides evidence of a historic upslope migration of P. incana in central Ecuador. In addition, it highlights the detrimental effects of unexpectedly strong genetic isolation, both recent and historical, particularly for our wind-pollinated species where the distance between forest stands was less than 25km. We therefore additionally propose that in habitats with pronounced high-mountain landscape structures, gene flow may be hampered to such an extent that species have a more pronounced sensitivity to habitat fragmentation, even among populations of wind-pollinated trees. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","The faunas associated with oceanic islands provide exceptional examples with which to examine the dispersal abilities of different taxa and test the relative contribution of selective and neutral processes in evolution. We examine the patterns of recent differentiation and the relative roles of gene flow and selection in genetic and morphological variation in the yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia aureola) from the Galápagos and Cocos Islands. Our analyses suggest aureola diverged from Central American lineages colonizing the Galápagos and Cocos Islands recently, likely less than 300000years ago. Within the Galápagos, patterns of genetic variation in microsatellite and mitochondrial markers suggest early stages of diversification. No intra-island patterns of morphological variation were found, even across steep ecological gradients, suggesting that either (i) high levels of gene flow may be homogenizing the effects of selection, (ii) populations may not have had enough time to accumulate the differences in morphological traits, or (iii) yellow warblers show lower levels of 'evolvability' than some other Galápagos species. By examining genetic data and morphological variation, our results provide new insight into the microevolutionary processes driving the patterns of variation. © 2012 The Authors.

Our results indicate that this species is only distantly related to both Spiranthes and Cyclopogon, the genera in which it has been included by previous taxonomists. Instead it is recovered as sister to a clade formed by Eurystyles and Lankesterella, with strong support from the Bayesian analysis. The new, monotypic genus Quechua is proposed to accommodate former S. glabrescens, which differs from both Eurystyles and Lankesterella in habit as well as in vegetative and reproductive characters. The main ecological and structural features of Quechua glabrescens are discussed and compared with those of other genera of Spiranthinae. © Copyright 2012 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.","The phylogenetic relationships of subtribe Chloraeinae, a group of terrestrial orchids endemic to southern South America, have not been satisfactorily investigated. A previous molecular phylogenetic analysis based on plastid DNA supported the monophyly of Chloraeinae and Gavilea, but showed that Chloraea is non-monophyletic and that the sole species of Bipinnula analysed is sister to Geoblasta. However, that analysis included only 18 of the 73 species belonging to this subtribe. Here, the phylogenetic relationships of Chloraeinae were assessed by analysing aproximately 7500bp of nucleotide sequences from nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and plastid DNA (rbcL, matK, trnL-trnF, rpoB-trnC) for 42 species representing all four currently accepted genera of Chloraeinae and appropriate outgroups. Nuclear and plastid data were analysed separately and in combination using two different methods, namely parsimony and Bayesian inference. Our analyses support the monophyly of Chloraeinae and their inclusion in an expanded concept of Cranichideae, but none of the genera of Chloraeinae that includes more than one species is monophyletic. Gavilea and Bipinnula are paraphyletic, with Chloraea chica nested in Gavilea and Geoblasta penicillata in Bipinnula. As currently delimited, Chloraea is polyphyletic. The taxonomic changes proposed recently are for the most part not justifiable on phylogenetic grounds, except for recognition of the monotypic genus Correorchis. The lack of resolution for the relationships among species of 'core'Chloraea suggests a relatively recent diversification of this group. The current generic classification is in need or revision, but additional study is advisable before carrying out further taxonomic changes. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.","The ITS2 gene class shows a high sequence divergence among its members that have complicated its annotation and its use for reconstructing phylogenies at a higher taxonomical level (beyond species and genus). Several alignment strategies have been implemented to improve the ITS2 annotation quality and its use for phylogenetic inferences. Although, alignment based methods have been exploited to the top of its complexity to tackle both issues, no alignment-free approaches have been able to successfully address both topics. By contrast, the use of simple alignment-free classifiers, like the topological indices (TIs) containing information about the sequence and structure of ITS2, may reveal to be a useful approach for the gene prediction and for assessing the phylogenetic relationships of the ITS2 class in eukaryotes. Thus, we used the TI2BioP (Topological Indices to BioPolymers) methodology [1,2], freely available at http://ti2biop.sourceforge.net/ to calculate two different TIs. One class was derived from the ITS2 artificial 2D structures generated from DNA strings and the other from the secondary structure inferred from RNA folding algorithms. Two alignment-free models based on Artificial Neural Networks were developed for the ITS2 class prediction using the two classes of TIs referred above. Both models showed similar performances on the training and the test sets reaching values above 95% in the overall classification. Due to the importance of the ITS2 region for fungi identification, a novel ITS2 genomic sequence was isolated from Petrakia sp. This sequence and the test set were used to comparatively evaluate the conventional classification models based on multiple sequence alignments like Hidden Markov based approaches, revealing the success of our models to identify novel ITS2 members. The isolated sequence was assessed using traditional and alignment-free based techniques applied to phylogenetic inference to complement the taxonomy of the Petrakia sp. fungal isolate. © 2011 Agüero-Chapin et al.","(Neuro)cysticercosis is an important zoonotic disease caused by infection with Taenia solium metacestode larvae. Existing immunodiagnostic techniques detect antibodies and circulating antigens (Ag) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Blood/CSF collection is an invasive procedure associated with blood-borne infections and is often not well accepted by communities. Detection of circulating Ag in urine has been suggested as an alternative, however this has been evaluated in clinical settings only. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the performance of a urine Ag-ELISA under field conditions. Paired serum and urine samples were obtained from participants in endemic areas of Ecuador (n= 748) and Zambia (n= 690) and were subjected to a monoclonal antibody-based Ag-ELISA. Calculation of positive and negative agreement indices (AI) showed better agreement in the negative direction both for Ecuadorian and Zambian samples (AI of 93.1 and 86.8, respectively). Using a Bayesian approach to determine the test characteristics, similar sensitivities were obtained for serum and urine Ag detection, whereas a decreased specificity was determined for the urine Ag-ELISA with a lower specificity (78.6%) for Zambian samples than for Ecuadorian samples (88.4%). This study indicates a higher specificity for the serum test under field conditions and promotes further research to improve the urine test. © 2011 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.","Contrasting generic concepts of Dichromanthus and Stenorrhynchos held recently by taxonomists were assessed by means of parsimony and Bayesian cladistics analyses of 40 species/22 genera of Spiranthinae and over 2400 base pairs of non-coding nuclear and plastid DNA. Floral structure of relevant taxa was compared using fresh, pickled and herbarium specimens. Our results indicate that a broad concept of Dichromanthus corresponds to a strongly supported monophyletic group sharing several ecogeographical attributes and at least one putative floral synapomorphy (nectary formed by a narrow channel at the base of the labellum). Dichromanthus s.l. occupies a derived position within the Spiranthes clade, with Deiregyne being strongly supported as its sister genus. Stenorrhynchos, as delimited by most previous taxonomists, is shown to be polyphyletic; monophyly requires a narrower delimitation and this narrow concept is strongly supported as belonging in the Stenorrhynchos clade, which also includes members of the genera Eltroplectris, Mesadenella, Pteroglossa and Sacoila. The scant published information on natural pollination and inferences made from flower colouration and morphology suggest convergence in floral characteristics between species of Dichromanthus, Stenorrhynchos and probably other distantly related genera as a result of independent adaptation to pollination by hummingbirds. Bee-pollinated D. michuacanus is recovered in a derived position relative to hummingbird-pollinated Dichromanthus spp., suggesting a secondary reversal in this trait. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London.","The distribution of the Galápagos land iguanas Conolophus subcristatus has been strongly affected by human activities in the last century. Previously widespread throughout the whole archipelago, today they inhabit only few islands, with populations often small and isolated. In this study, we analyzed the population genetic structure of land iguanas from Santa Cruz Island to investigate the genetic implications of a semi-captive conservation program that started in middle 1970s and is still ongoing. Nine microsatellites were used to measure the level of genetic variability and to detect potential evidence of inbreeding and genetic sub-structure. Furthermore, we used approximate Bayesian computation, together with software packages for coalescent-based simulations, to test a priori hypotheses in different demographic scenarios. Despite the abrupt reduction in size of the original population, no evidence of inbreeding was found, and the levels of genetic variability were similar to those of undisturbed populations of the archipelago. Nevertheless, the source and the repatriated populations started differentiating (FST=0.016) and genetic sub-structure was found. Following our results and the simulation of possible future scenarios, we suggest the genetic measures that should be adopted to avoid further genetic variability depletion and preserve this vulnerable endemic species. © 2011 The Authors.

Atelopus monophyly has been suggested but intergeneric, interspecific and intraspecific relationships are poorly understood. One reason is that morphological characters of harlequin frogs are often difficult to interpret, making species delimitations difficult. Molecular analyses (DNA barcoding, phylogeny) may be helpful but sampling is hampered as most of the more than 100 Atelopus species have undergone severe population declines and many are possibly extinct. We processed mitochondrial DNA (12S and 16S rRNA) of 28 available ingroup samples from a large portion of the genus' geographic range (Bayesian Inference, Maximum Likelihood). Our samples constitute a monophyletic unit, which is sister to other bufonid genera studied including the Andean genus Osornophryne. In contrast to previous morphological studies, our results suggest that Osornophryne is neither sister to Atelopus nor nested within it. Within Atelopus, we note two major clades with well supported subclades, one Amazonian-Guianan Clade (Flavescens-spumarius Clade plus Tricolor Clade) and an Andean-Chocó-Central American Clade (Varius Clade plus all other Atelopus). The first mentioned includes all species that possess a middle ear (i.e. stapes) except for A. seminiferus lacking it (like all remaining Atelopus). Previously proposed species groups based on frog-like versus toad-like overall appearance (i.e. Longirostris and Ignescens Groups) or phalangeal reduction in the thumb (i.e. Flavescens Group) are not monophyletic in our phylogeny, thus characters used to define them are not considered synapomorphies. We show that genetic divergence can be high between species belonging to different clades, in spite of their phenetic similarity (e.g. A. pulcher, Atelopus sp. 2). On the other hand, within the same clade, colour can vary tremendously, while genetic divergence is low (e.g. A. flavescens and allies). These observations demonstrate that Atelopus taxonomy is complicated and that an integrative approach is required before 'splitting' or 'lumping' nominal species. © 2011 The Natural History Museum.","In the preset report, for the first time, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), Bayesian networks (BNs), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) are applied and compared on two \"in-house\" datasets to describe the tyrosinase inhibitory activity from the molecular structure. The data set Data I is used for the identification of tyrosinase inhibitors (TIs) including 701 active and 728 inactive compounds. Data II consists of active chemicals for potency estimation of TIs. The 2D TOMOCOMD-CARDD atom-based quadratic indices are used as molecular descriptors. The derived models show rather encouraging results with the areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AURC) curve in the test set above 0.943 and 0.846 for the Data I and Data II, respectively. Multiple comparison tests are carried out to compare the performance of the models and reveal the improvement of machine learning (ML) techniques with respect to statistical ones (see Chemometr. Intell. Lab. Syst. 2010, 104, 249). In some cases, these ameliorations are statistically significant. The tests also demostrate that k-NN, despite being a rather simple approach, presents the best behavior in both data. The obtained results suggest that the ML-based models could help to improve the virtual screening procedures and the confluence of these different techniques can increase the practicality of data mining procedures of chemical databases for the discovery of novel TIs as possible depigmenting agents.

Thus, the Topological Indices to BioPolymers (TI2BioP) methodology (Agüero-Chapin et al., 2010) inspired in both the TOPS-MODE and the MARCH-INSIDE methodologies allows the calculation of simple topological indices (TIs) as alignment-free classifiers. These indices were derived from the clustering of the amino acids into four classes of hydrophobicity and polarity revealing higher sequence-order information beyond the amino acid composition level. The predictability power of such TIs was evaluated for the first time on the RNase III family, due to the high diversity of its members (primary sequence and domain organization). Three non-linear models were developed for RNase III class prediction: Decision Tree Model (DTM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)-model and Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The first two are alignment-free approaches, using TIs as input predictors. Their performances were compared with a non-classical HMM, modified according to our amino acid clustering strategy. The alignment-free models showed similar performances on the training and the test sets reaching values above 90% in the overall classification. The non-classical HMM showed the highest rate in the classification with values above 95% in training and 100% in test. Although the higher accuracy of the HMM, the DTM showed simplicity for the RNase III classification with low computational cost. Such simplicity was evaluated in respect to HMM and ANN models for the functional annotation of a new bacterial RNase III class member, isolated and annotated by our group. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Brown-headed spider monkeys (Ateles fusciceps), endemic to the Choco-Darien forests and lower Andean forests of NW Ecuador, are considered critically endangered. Unfortunately, scientific data regarding the actual status of populations is lacking. We combined satellite image analysis, species-specific habitat assessment, and a field survey technique using playback to focus conservation efforts for this species. First, we identified remaining forest via a LANDSAT mosaic and then applied species-specific criteria to delineate remaining forest with potential to hold populations. By combining this with the historical distribution from ecological niche modeling and predicted hunting intensity we generated a species-specific landscape map. Within our study area, forest capable of sustaining Ateles fusciceps covers 5872 km2, of which 2172 km2 (40%) is protected. Unprotected forest considered suitable for Ateles fusciceps extends to 3700 km2 but within this only 989 km2 (23%) is under low hunting pressure and likely to maintain healthy populations of Ateles fusciceps. To overcome problems of sampling at low primate density and in difficult mountain terrain we developed a field survey technique to determine presence and estimate abundance using acoustic sampling. For sites under low hunting pressure density of primates varied with altitude. Densities decreased from 7.49 individuals/km2 at 332 masl to 0.9 individuals/km2 at 1570 masl. Based on combining data sets in a gap analysis, we recommend conservation action focus on unprotected lowland forest to the south and west of the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve where hunting pressure is low and population densities of Ateles fusciceps are greatest. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Bactridinae include about 150 species of spiny Neotropical palms in five genera that are ecologically important in several vegetation types such as open woodland (Acrocomia), lowland rainforest (Astrocaryum, Bactris), and montane forest (Aiphanes). The subtribe also includes the only exclusively lianescent palm genus in the Neotropics (Desmoncus). We present a fully resolved molecular phylogeny of 41 species of Bactridinae, representing all genera as well as most of the currently accepted infrageneric taxa (subgenera, sections etc.) and recently proposed informal groups. Analyses are based on five plastid DNA regions (matK, trnQ-rps16, rps16 intron, trnD-trnT, trnL-trnF) and three nuclear markers (PRK, RPB2, ITS). A combined dataset was analysed with likelihood and parsimony methods. The results show that all accepted taxa at and above the generic level are monophyletic with high support. Astrocaryum alatum and A. mexicanum, recently segregated into a genus of their own (Hexopetion), form a strongly supported monophyletic group sister to the remaining Astrocaryum species. Desmoncus and Acrocomia are resolved as sister genera, and together they are sister to the remaining Bactridinae. This finding contrasts with that of two previous studies reporting Acrocomia to be sister to the rest of the subtribe. Aiphanes is resolved as sister to Bactris and Astrocaryum. Species-level relationships recovered within Astrocaryum and Bactris disagree to a large extent with previous morphology-based infrageneric classifications, suggesting that those characters are homoplasious, particularly within Bactris. A Bayesian dating analysis using the relaxed-clock model indicates that most genera of Bactridinae diverged during a relatively short period around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, which might explain the difficulties in resolving the phylogenetic backbone of the group. The mostly Andean genus Aiphanes shows an initial radiation of early lineages in the Oligocene (around 25 Ma ago) corresponding to an early uplift phase of the cordillera. These taxa are nowadays restricted to the mountain forests of Colombia and Ecuador. The main diversification of Andean Aiphanes began in the Miocene (around 11 Ma ago). This study provides the first substantial insight into Bactridinae phylogeny and sets the stage for more comprehensively sampled species-level studies analysing drivers of diversity of Neotropical palms, speciation patterns, character evolution, or biogeography.","This study tests the hypothesis that female South American sea lions shift from off-shore, pelagic prey to coastal, benthic prey after parturition in order to reduce the foraging trip duration and hence the time pups remain unattended on the beach during early lactation. The δ13C and δ15N values of the serum and blood cells of 26 South American sea lion suckling pups from northern Patagonia were used to track the dietary changes of their mothers from late pregnancy to early lactation, after correction for differential isotopic fractionation between tissues. Primary producers and potential prey species were also analysed to establish a baseline for interpreting the stable isotope concentration of serum and blood cells. Isotopic ratios revealed a generalized increase in the consumption of coastal-benthic prey after parturition. Such a generalized post-partum shift will allow females to spend more time on land and look after their pups. The effects of this foraging strategy on the nutritional quality of the female's diet are discussed.","The evolutionary relationships of Andean harlequin frogs were studied, with emphasis on the Atelopus ignescens and A. bomolochos species complexes. Sampling included 53 individuals belonging to eight taxa and several unidentified species, for which a mitochondrial fragment (16S, tRNA-Leu, ND1, and tRNA-Ile; 1294 bp) was amplified. Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analyses were used to obtain hypotheses of relationships. The resulting phylogeny indicates that the species complexes are non-monophyletic. Additionally, analyses support the presence of four or five undescribed species. Most of these populations and newly discovered lineages have not been recorded in several years and are presumed extinct, the exception being two populations of probably new taxa from mid-elevations in southeastern Ecuador found during recent field surveys. Although sampling is limited, geographic isolation is the most plausible cause of differentiation among populations and taxa.

Serological tests are the most appropriate diagnostic tools to understand the transmission dynamics of the parasite, but the performances of these methods in such a setting are not known. A south Ecuadorian human population living in an endemic area was tested using three common serological tests. Because none of them is a gold standard, a Bayesian Latent Class analysis was used to estimate the test characteristics. Two definitions of a case were considered to differentiate between prevalence of current infection and prior exposure to the parasite. Differences between the performances of the same test in function of the definition of a case were observed. This study shows that test results and prior information should be interpreted carefully in a Bayesian analysis framework, particularly when the latter is based on clinical studies.

Uncovering how populations of a species differ genetically and ecologically is important for understanding evolutionary processes. Here we combine population genetic methods (microsatellites) with phylogenetic information (mtDNA) to define genetic population clusters of the wide-spread Neotropical tngara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus). We measure gene flow and migration within and between population clusters and compare genetic diversity between population clusters. By applying ecological niche modeling we determine whether the two most divergent genetic groups of the tngara frog (1) inhabit different habitats, and (2) are separated geographically by unsuitable habitat across a gap in the distribution. Results. Most population structure is captured by dividing all sample localities into two allopatric genetic lineages. The Northern genetic lineage (NW Costa Rica) is genetically homogenous while the Southern lineage (SW Costa Rica and Panama) is sub-divided into three population clusters by both microsatellite and mtDNA analyses. Gene flow is higher within the Northern lineage than within the Southern lineage, perhaps due to increased landscape heterogeneity in the South. Niche modeling reveals differences in suitable habitat between the Northern and Southern lineages: the Northern lineage inhabits dry/pine-oak forests, while the Southern lineage is confined to tropical moist forests. Both lineages seem to have had little movement across the distribution gap, which persisted during the last glacial maximum. The lack of movement was more pronounced for the Southern lineage than for the Northern lineage. Conclusions. This study confirms the finding of previous studies that tngara frogs diverged into two allopatric genetic lineages north and south of the gap in the distribution in central Costa Rica several million years ago. The allopatric distribution is attributed to unsuitable habitat and probably other unknown ecological factors present across the distribution gap. Niche conservatism possibly contributes to preventing movements across the gap and gene flow between both groups. Genetic and ecological data indicate that there is the potential for ecological divergence in allopatry between lineages. In this context we discuss whether the Northern and Southern lineages should be recognized as separate species, and we conclude that further studies of pre- and post-zygotic isolation are needed for a final assessment. Identified population clusters should motivate future behavioral and ecological research regarding within-species biodiversity and speciation mechanisms. © 2010 Pröhl et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","The growth pattern of Loxechinus albus in southern Chile was studied using size-at-age data obtained by reading growth bands on the genital plates. The scatter plots of sizes-at-age for samples collected in three different locations indicated that growth is linear between ages 2 and 10. Five different growth models, including linear, asymptotic and non-asymptotic functions, were fitted to the data, and model selection was conducted based on the Akaike information criteria (AIC) and the Bayesian information criteria (BIC). The AIC identified the Tanaka model as the most suitable for two of the three sites. However, the BIC led to the selection of the linear model for all zones. Our results show that the growth pattern of L. albus is different from the predominantly asymptotic pattern that has been reported for other sea urchin species. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Phylogenetic relationships were studied in the genus Cyanocorax (Aves: Corvidae) and related genera, Psilorhinus and Calocitta, a diverse group of New World jays distributed from the southern United States south to Argentina. Although the ecology and behavior of some species in the group have been studied extensively, lack of a molecular phylogeny has precluded rigorous interpretations in an evolutionary framework. Given the diverse combinations of plumage coloration, size, and morphology, the taxonomy of the group has been inconsistent and understanding of biogeographic patterns problematic. Moreover, plumage similarity between two geographically disjuct species, the Tufted jay (Cyanocorax dickeyi) from western Mexico and the White-tailed jay (C. mystacalis) from western Ecuador and Peru, has puzzled ornithologists for decades. Here, a phylogeny of all species in the three genera is presented, based on study of two mitochondrial and three nuclear genes. Phylogenetic trees revealed the non-monophyly of Cyanocorax, and the division of the whole assemblage in two groups: \"Clade A\" containing Psilorhinus morio, both species in Calocitta, Cyanocorax violaceus, C. caeruleus, C. cristatellus, and C. cyanomelas, and \"Clade B\" consisting of the remaining species in Cyanocorax. Relationships among species in Clade A were ambiguous and, in general, not well resolved. Within Clade B, analyses revealed the monophyly of the \"Cissilopha\" jays and showed no evidence for a sister relationship between C. mystacalis and C. dickeyi. The phylogenetic complexity of lineages in the group suggests several complications for the understanding biogeographic patterns, as well as for proposing a taxonomy that is consistent with morphological variation. Although multiple taxonomic arrangements are possible, recommendations are for recognizing only one genus, Cyanocorax, with Psilorhinus and Calocitta as synonyms. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.","Background: Although not unusual to find captive relicts of species lost in the wild, rarely are presumed extinct species rediscovered outside of their native range. A recent study detected living descendents of an extinct Galápagos tortoise species (Chelonoidis elephantopus) once endemic to Floreana Island on the neighboring island of Isabela. This finding adds to the growing cryptic diversity detected among these species in the wild. There also exists a large number of Galápagos tortoises in captivity of ambiguous origin. The recently accumulated population-level haplotypic and genotypic data now available for C. elephantopus add a critical reference population to the existing database of 11 extant species for investigating the origin of captive individuals of unknown ancestry. Methodology/Findings:We reanalyzed mitochondrial DNA control region haplotypes and microsatellite genotypes of 156 captive individuals using an expanded reference database that included all extant Galápagos tortoise species as well as the extinct species from Floreana. Nine individuals (six females and three males) exhibited strong signatures of Floreana ancestry and a high probability of assignment to C. elephantopus as detected by Bayesian assignment and clustering analyses of empirical and simulated data. One male with high assignment probability to C. elephantopus based on microsatellite genotypic data also possessed a \"Floreana-like\" mitochondrial DNA haplotype. Significance: Historical DNA analysis of museum specimens has provided critical spatial and temporal components to ecological, evolutionary, taxonomic and conservation-related research, but rarely has it informed ex situ species recovery efforts. Here, the availability of population-level genotypic data from the extinct C. elephantopus enabled the identification of nine Galápagos tortoise individuals of substantial conservation value that were previously misassigned to extant species of varying conservation status. As all captive individuals of C. elephantopus ancestry currently reside at a centralized breeding facility on Santa Cruz, these findings permit breeding efforts to commence in support of the reestablishment of this extinct species to its native range. © 2010 Russello et al.","Background. Marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) inhabit the coastlines of large and small islands throughout the Galpagos archipelago, providing a rich system to study the spatial and temporal factors influencing the phylogeographic distribution and population structure of a species. Here, we analyze the microevolution of marine iguanas using the complete mitochondrial control region (CR) as well as 13 microsatellite loci representing more than 1200 individuals from 13 islands. Results. CR data show that marine iguanas occupy three general clades: one that is widely distributed across the northern archipelago, and likely spread from east to west by way of the South Equatorial current, a second that is found mostly on the older eastern and central islands, and a third that is limited to the younger northern and western islands. Generally, the CR haplotype distribution pattern supports the colonization of the archipelago from the older, eastern islands to the younger, western islands. However, there are also signatures of recurrent, historical gene flow between islands after population establishment. Bayesian cluster analysis of microsatellite genotypes indicates the existence of twenty distinct genetic clusters generally following a one-cluster-per-island pattern. However, two well-differentiated clusters were found on the easternmost island of San Cristábal, while nine distinct and highly intermixed clusters were found on youngest, westernmost islands of Isabela and Fernandina. High mtDNA and microsatellite genetic diversity were observed for populations on Isabela and Fernandina that may be the result of a recent population expansion and founder events from multiple sources. Conclusions. While a past genetic study based on pure FSTanalysis suggested that marine iguana populations display high levels of nuclear (but not mitochondrial) gene flow due to male-biased dispersal, the results of our sex-biased dispersal tests and the finding of strong genetic differentiation between islands do not support this view. Therefore, our study is a nice example of how recently developed analytical tools such as Bayesian clustering analysis and DNA sequence-based demographic analyses can overcome potential biases introduced by simply relying on F STestimates from markers with different inheritance patterns. © 2009 Steinfartz et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","The genus Stenocercus is composed of 61 species that occur mainly in the Andes and adjacent lowland areas (0-4 000 m) from northern Colombia and Venezuela to central Argentina. In this study, I performed parsimony and Bayesian analyses to infer the phylogenetic relationships among the 20 species of Stenocercus that occur in the northern Andes (Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela); I analyzed morphological, molecular, and combined datasets. These analyses resulted in similar topologies, which indicate that species of Stenocercus from the northern Andes are nested within 2 major clades. One of these clades contains 6 species occurring between southern Ecuador and southern Colombia, whereas the other clade includes 13 species that occur from southern Ecuador to northern Colombia and Venezuela. The results also suggest that the recent uplift of the northern Andes has had a major impact on the evolution of Stenocercus.","The Agaricales is the largest and most diverse order of mushroom-forming Basidiomycota, with over 100 natural groups recognized in recent Fungal Tree of Life studies. Most agarics are either saprotrophic or ectomycorrhizal fungi, but the family Hygrophoraceae is in part characterized by a unique and remarkable diversity of lichenized forms. The most familiar of these is the chlorolichen genus Lichenomphalia, whose phylogenetic position in the Agaricales has been established. Recent limited evidence suggested that Hygrophoraceae also contains cyanolichens in the genus Dictyonema, which indicates a remarkable concentration and diversity of lichen-formers in a single family of agarics. To demonstrate the relationships of lichen-formers to other fungi in the family, we assembled ribosomal sequences from 52 species representing recognized groups within the Hygrophoraceae, among them new sequences representing Acantholichen and most species and forms of Dictyonema. The molecular data were evaluated using parsimony, likelihood, Bayesian, and distance analyses, including coding of ambiguous regions by means of INAASE and ARC, all of which indicate that Dictyonema and Acantholichen form a monophyletic clade derived from the primarily bryophilous genus Arrhenia and sister to the enigmatic Athelia pyriformis, a species unrelated to the Atheliales for which we are proposing a new genus name Eonema. The chlorolichen genus Lichenomphalia may be polyphyletic. Fungi in the Dictyonema-Acantholichen clade are typically tropical, entirely lichenized, and associate with cyanobacterial photobionts. Our data indicate a transition from agaricoid-omphalinoid basidiomes observed in Arrhenia to stereoid-corticioid forms in Dictyonema, and also support a previous suggestion of a connection between loss of clamp connections and lichenization. The diverse basidiome and thallus morphologies and nutritional ecologies of these fungi indicate a remarkable evolutionary flexibility that appears to have developed in part as a consequence of symbiosis. © 2009 The British Mycological Society.","The endangered Galápagos Cormorant, Phalacrocorax harrisi, is unique among the species of the Phalacrocoracidae in being flightless and sequentially polyandrous. It has had a vexed taxonomic history, variously being lumped with all the species in Phalacrocorax, being accorded its own genus, Nannopterum, or being included in Leucocarbo or Compsohalieus. Different authorities have similarly suggested a number of different species as being its closest relative. Here we use novel mitochondrial DNA sequence data to show that the Galápagos Cormorant is related to the sister pair of the mainland Americas, the Double-crested Cormorant, P. auritus, and the Neotropic Cormorant, P. brasilianus. This trio of species has high statistical support (Bayesian posterior probability of 1.00; NJ bootstrap 98%; MP bootstrap 91%). The Galápagos Cormorant is thus a relatively recent offshoot of the mainland form, which has subsequently evolved flightlessness. Until the phylogeny of the cormorants is more clearly resolved, we recommend the continued use of Phalacrocorax for all species. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Here we present the first detailed assessment of its distribution, ecology and conservation. We first used a maximum entropy model (Maxent model) to create a predicted distribution for this species based on very limited species occurrence data. We used this model to guide field surveys for the species between April and October 2006. We found a positive relationship between model values and species presence, indicating that the model was a useful tool to predict species occurrence and guide exploration. In the sites where the metaltail was found we gathered data on its habitat requirements, food resources and behaviour. Our results indicate that Violet-throated Metaltail is restricted to the Western Cordillera of the Andes Mountains in Azuay and Cañar provinces of Ecuador, with an area of extent of less than 2,000 km2. Deep river canyons to the north and south, lack of suitable habitat, and potential interspecific competition in the east may limit the bird's distribution. The species occurred in three distinct habitats, including Polylepis woodland, the upper edge of the montane forest, and in shrubby paramo, but we found no difference in relative abundance among these habitats. The metaltail seems to tolerate moderate human intervention in its habitats as long as some native brushy cover is maintained. We found that Brachyotum sp., Berberis sp., and Barnadesia sp. were important nectar resources. The 'Endangered' status of this species is supported due to its restricted distribution in fragmented habitats which are under increasing human pressures. © 2009 BirdLife International.","Background and AimsPhylogenetic relationships of subtribes Cranichidinae and Prescottiinae, two diverse groups of neotropical terrestrial orchids, are not satisfactorily understood. A previous molecular phylogenetic study supported monophyly for Cranichidinae, but Prescottiinae consisted of two clades not sister to one another. However, that analysis included only 11 species and eight genera of these subtribes. Here, plastid and nuclear DNA sequences are analysed for an enlarged sample of genera and species of Cranichidinae and Prescottiinae with the aim of clarifying their relationships, evaluating the phylogenetic position of the monospecific genera Exalaria, Ocampoa and Pseudocranichis and examining the value of various structural traits as taxonomic markers.MethodsApprox. 6000 bp of nucleotide sequences from nuclear ribosomal (ITS) and plastid DNA (rbcL, matK-trnK and trnL-trnF) were analysed with cladistic parsimony and Bayesian inference for 45 species/14 genera of Cranichidinae and Prescottiinae (plus suitable outgroups). The utility of flower orientation, thickenings of velamen cell walls, hamular viscidium and pseudolabellum to mark clades recovered by the molecular analysis was assessed by tracing these characters on the molecular trees.Key ResultsSpiranthinae, Cranichidinae, paraphyletic Prescottia (with Pseudocranichis embedded), and a group of mainly Andean 'prescottioid' genera (the 'Stenoptera clade') were strongly supported. Relationships among these clades were unresolved by parsimony but the Bayesian tree provided moderately strong support for the resolution (Spiranthinae-(Stenoptera clade-(Prescottia/Pseudocranichis- Cranichidinae))). Three of the four structural characters mark clades on the molecular trees, but the possession of a pseudolabellum is variable in the polyphyletic Ponthieva.ConclusionsNo evidence was found for monophyly of Prescottiinae and the reinstatement of Cranichidinae s.l. (including the genera of 'Prescottiinae') is favoured. Cranichidinae s.l. are diagnosed by non-resupinate flowers. Lack of support from parsimony for relationships among the major clades of core spiranthids is suggestive of a rapid morphological radiation or a slow rate of molecular evolution.","Based on a molecular phytogeny, a new phylogenetic taxonomy that is compatible with both the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) and the PhyloCode is proposed for Glassfrogs and their sister taxon, Allophryne ruthveni. The arrangement presented herein emphasizes the recognition of clades having (i) significant statistical support and congruence among phylogenetic estimation methods (i.e., parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference criteria), (ii) congruence among genetic markers, and (iii) morphological and/or behavioral distinctiveness. Also, when previously recognized groups are recovered as monophyletic or nearly monophyletic, we propose taxa that minimize the number of name changes required to make these groups monophyletic, preserving the names and contents of previous classifications (i.e., nomenclatural stability). The evolutionary proximity of Centrolenidae and Allophrynidae is recognized by combining these families into an unraked taxon, Allocentroleniae - a proposal that maintains the traditional names and species contents of Centrolenidae and Allophrynidae. We arrange centrolenid diversity in two subfamilies: Centroleninae and Hyalinobatrachinae. Within Centroleninae, the diagnosis and species content of the genera Centrolene, Cochranella, and Nymphargus are modified; Teratohyla is resurrected and modified, and Chimerella, Espadamna, Rulyrana, Sachatamia, and Vitreorana are proposed as new genera. The other subfamily, Hyalinobatrachinae, contains the new genus Celsiella and a modified Hyalinobatrachium that fully corresponds to the former fleischmanni Group. Additionally, the genus Ikakogi is described. Ikakogi could not be assigned with confidence to either subfamily and it is placed as incertae sedis in Centrolenidae. The data at hand suggest that Ikakogi tayrona is a lineage as old as the subfamilies Hyalinobatrachinae and Centroleninae. The revised taxonomy differs markedly from previous arrangements, which were based on phenetics and few morphological characters. Most of the genera defined herein are confined to distinct biogeographic regions, highlighting the importance of geography in the speciation of Glassfrogs. The principal limitation of this proposal is that it is based on an incomplete sampling of taxa (54% of the recognized Glassfrogs). Although diagnoses are based on phenotypic traits, there are several cases (16% of all species) in which the allocation of species is ambiguous because of morphological homoplasy and the lack of molecular data. Finally, in an attempt to facilitate species identification, comparison, and generic placement, we provide photographs for most (∼ 96%) of the recognized centrolenid species. © 2009 Magnolia Press.","We assessed colony- and island-level genetic differentiation for the flightless cormorant (Phalacrocorax harrisi), an endangered Galápagos endemic that has one of the most limited geographical distributions of any seabird, consisting of only two adjacent islands. We screened 223 individuals from both islands and nine colonies at five microsatellite loci, recovering 23 alleles. We found highly significant genetic differentiation throughout the flightless cormorant's range on Fernandina and Isabela Islands (global F ST = 0.097; P < 0.0003) both between islands (supported by Bayesian analyses, FSTand RST values) and within islands (supported only by FST and RST values). An overall pattern of isolation-by-distance was evident throughout the sampled range (r = 0.4169, one-sided P ≤ 0.02) and partial Mantel tests of this relationship confirmed that ocean is a dispersal barrier (r = 0.500, one-sided P ≤ 0.003), especially across the 5-km gap between the two islands. The degree of detected genetic differentiation among colonies is surprising, given the flightless cormorant's limited range, and suggests a role for low vagility, behavioural philopatry, or both to limit dispersal where physical barriers are absent. We argue that this population should be managed as at least two genetic populations to better preserve the species-level genetic diversity, but, for demographic reasons, advocate the continued conservation of all breeding colonies. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae.

In order to gain insight into these matters, we used a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, to analyze envelope (E) gene sequences of the DENV-3 genotype III of strains included in a monophyletic cluster composed by Ecuadorian as well as strains from Cuba, Puerto Rico and Peru. The results of these studies revealed that the expansion population growth model was the best fit to the data. The most common recent ancestor (MRCA) was placed around 1989, in agreement with the first reports of the emergence of this new DENV-3 type. A mean rate 1.033 × 10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year was obtained. This rate is comparatively higher than the ones obtained for DENV-2 and DENV-4 in the same region. Faster population growth and greater population dispersal may have contributed to the vigorous initial transmission dynamics of this genotype in the Latin American region. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, determinants of Neotropical biodiversity (i.e. , vicariance, dispersals, extinctions, and radiations) earlier than the Quaternary are largely unstudied. Using a novel method of ancestral area reconstruction and relaxed Bayesian clock analyses, we reconstructed the biogeography of the poison frog clade (Dendrobatidae). We rejected an Amazonian center-of-origin in favor of a complex connectivity model expanding over the Neotropics. We inferred 14 dispersals into and 18 out of Amazonia to adjacent regions; the Andes were the major source of dispersals into Amazonia. We found three episodes of lineage dispersal with two interleaved periods of vicariant events between South and Central America. During the late Miocene, Amazonian, and Central American-Chocoan lineages significantly increased their diversity compared to the Andean and Guianan-Venezuelan- Brazilian Shield counterparts. Significant percentage of dendrobatid diversity in Amazonia and Chocó resulted from repeated immigrations, with radiations at <10.0 million years ago (MYA), rather than in situ diversification. In contrast, the Andes, Venezuelan Highlands, and Guiana Shield have undergone extended in situ diversification at near constant rate since the Oligocene. The effects of Miocene paleogeographic events on Neotropical diversification dynamics provided the framework under which Quaternary patterns of endemism evolved.","Phylogenetic relationships were studied in the genus Cyanolyca, an assemblage of jays distributed from Mexico south to Bolivia. Given its fragmented distribution along the humid forests of the Neotropics, the genus Cyanolyca is a model group for exploring hypotheses on biogeography and speciation. Phylogenetic analyses were based on two mitochondrial and three nuclear loci; taxon sampling includes all species in the genus and most subspecies. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses produced trees that were congruent and highly robust at both terminal and deep nodes of the phylogeny. Cyanolyca comprises two major clades: one contains the Mesoamerican \"dwarf\" jays, and the other consists of two main groups-C. cucullata + C. pulchra and the \"core\" South American species. Prior hypotheses of relationships were explored statistically using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Dispersal-Vicariance analysis revealed the importance of the Northern Andes as a major center for biological diversification, and the effects of dispersal across the Panamanian Land Bridge in the composition of South American and Mesoamerican avifaunas. Phylogenetic patterns are highly congruent with an allopatric mode of speciation. Implications of these results are discussed in the context of the biogeography of Neotropical montane forests. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Background. The genus Algansea is one of the most representative freshwater fish groups in central Mexico due to its wide geographic distribution and unusual level of endemicity. Despite the small number of species, this genus has had an unsettled taxonomic history due to high levels of intraspecific morphological variation. Moreover, several phylogenetic hypotheses among congeners have been proposed but have had the following shortcomings: the use of homoplasious morphological characters, the use of character codification and polarisation methods that lacked objectivity, and incomplete taxonomic sampling. In this study, a phylogenetic analysis among species of Algansea is presented. This analysis is based upon two molecular markers, the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b and the first intron of the ribosomal protein S7 gene. Results. Bayesian analysis based on a combined matrix (cytochrome b and first intron S7) showed that Algansea is a monophyletic group and that Agosia chrysogaster is the sister group. Divergence times dated the origin of the genus around 16.6 MYA, with subsequent cladogenetic events occurring between 6.4 and 2.8 MYA. When mapped onto the molecular phylogenetic hypothesis, the character states of three morphological characters did not support previous hypotheses on the evolution of morphological traits in the genus Algansea, whereas the character states of the remaining six characters partially corroborated those hypotheses. Conclusion. Monophyly of the genus Algansea was corroborated in this study. Tree topology shows the genus consists of three main lineages: Central-Eastern, Western, and Southern clades. However, the relationships among these clades remained unresolved. Congruence found between the available geological and climatic history and the divergence times made it possible to infer the biogeographical history of Algansea, which suggested that vicariance events were responsible for the evolutionary history of the genus. Interestingly, this pattern was shared with other members of the freshwater fish fauna of central Mexico. In addition, molecular data also show that some morphological traits alleged to represent synapomorphies in previous studies were actually homoplasies. Others traits were corroborated as synapomorphies, particularly in those species of a subgroup corresponding with the Central-Eastern clade within Algansea; this corroboration is interpreted as a result of evolutionary adaptations. © 2009 Pérez-Rodríguez et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Non-parametric bootstrapping is one of the most commonly used methods for branch support assessment. Unlike Bayesian posterior probability values, which are influenced by a priori data partitioning, non-parametric bootstrapping is usually applied to unpartitioned (combined) datasets. The resulting bootstrap support values are misleading in that they do not measure how well clades are supported by all the partitions, unless all partitions are equal in size (i.e., number of characters). Since most empirical studies include data partitions that are heterogeneous in size, our current bootstrapping approach for partitioned datasets (i.e., bootstrapping the combined dataset) is not adequate. Here I propose a simple modification to non-parametric bootstrapping that takes a priori data partitioning into account by obtaining bootstrap replicates for each partition separately and combining them in such a way that the size (i.e., number of characters) of each partition is taken into account. With this \"corrected\" bootstrap support value, characters from smaller partitions will have greater influence on final bootstrap values, and those in larger partitions relatively less influence than they would for unpartitioned data.","The Galápagos land iguanas (genus Conolophus) have faced significant anthropogenic disturbances since the 17th century, leading to severe reduction of some populations and the extinction of others. Conservation activities, including the repatriation of captive-bred animals to depleted areas, have been ongoing since the late 1970s, but genetic information has not been extensively incorporated. Here we use nine species-specific microsatellite loci of 703 land iguanas from the six islands where the species occur today to characterize the genetic diversity within, and the levels of genetic differentiation among, current populations as well as test previous hypotheses about accidental translocations associated with early conservation efforts. Our analyses indicate that (i) five populations of iguanas represent distinct conservation units (one of them being the recently discovered rosada form) and could warrant species status, (ii) some individuals from North Seymour previously assumed to be from the natural Baltra population appear related to both Isabela and Santa Cruz populations, and (iii) the five different management units exhibit considerably different levels of intrapopulation genetic diversity, with the Plaza Sur and Santa Fe populations particularly low. Although the initial captive breeding programmes, coupled with intensive efforts to eradicate introduced species, saved several land iguana populations from extinction, our molecular results provide objective data for improving continuing in situ species survival plans and population management for this spectacular and emblematic reptile. © 2008 The Authors.","Rationale: Bedside use of Bayes' theorem for estimating probabilities of diseases is cumbersome. An alternative approach based on five categories of powers of tests from 'useless' to 'very strong' has been proposed. The performance of clinicians using it was assessed. Methods: Fifty clinicians attending a course of tropical medicine estimated powers of tests and post-test probabilities using the classical vs. the categorical Bayesian approach. The estimation of post-test probability was assessed for real and dummy diseases in order to avoid the bias of previous knowledge. Accuracy of answers was measured by the difference with reference values obtained from an expert system (Kabisa). Results: Clinicians estimated positive likelihood ratios (LRs) a median of -1.07 log10 lower than Kabisa [interquartile range (IQR): -1.47; -0.80] when derived classically and -0.17 (IQR: -0.42; +0.04) when estimated categorically (P < 0.001). For negative LRs the median was +0.39 log 10 higher (IQR: +0.71; +0.08) when derived classically and -0.18 log10 lower (IQR: +0.03; -0.36) when estimated categorically (P < 0.001). Twenty (40%) disclosed not being able to calculate post-test probabilities using sensitivities and specificities. Regardless the approach post-test probabilities were overestimated both for real and dummy diseases [respectively +1.23 log10 (IQR: +0,67; +2.08) and +2.03 log 10 (IQR: +0.49; +2.42)] (P = 0277), but the range was wider for the latter (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Participants were more accurate in estimating powers with a categorical approach than with sensitivities and specificities. Post-test probabilities were overestimated with both approaches. Knowledge of the disease did not influence the estimation of post-test probabilities. A categorical approach might be an interesting instructional tool, but the effect of training with this approach needs assessment. © 2008 The Authors.","Numerous collecting expeditions of Theobroma cacao L. germplasm have been undertaken in Latin-America. However, most of this germplasm has not contributed to cacao improvement because its relationship to cultivated selections was poorly understood. Germplasm labeling errors have impeded breeding and confounded the interpretation of diversity anaylses. To improve the understanding of the origin, classification, and population differentiation within the species, 1241 accessions covering a large geographic sampling were genotyped with 106 microsatellite markers. After discarding mislabeled samples, 10 genetic clusters, as opposed to the two genetic groups traditionally recognized within T. cacao, were found by applying Bayesian statistics. This leads us to propose a new classification of the cacao germplasm that will enhance its management. The results also provide new insights into the diversification of Amazon species in general, with the pattern of differentiation of the populations studied supporting the palaeoarches hypothesis of species diversification. The origin of the traditional cacao cultivars is also enlightened in this study.","Glassfrogs (family Centrolenidae) represent an exceptionally diverse group among Neotropical anurans, but their evolutionary relationships never have been assessed from a molecular perspective. Mitochondrial and nuclear markers were used to develop a novel hypothesis of centrolenid phylogeny. Ingroup sampling included 100 terminals, with 78 (53%) of the named species in the family, representing most of the phenotypic diversity described for the group. Thirty-five species representing taxa traditionally associated with glassfrogs were used as outgroups. Gene sampling consisted of complete or partial sequences of three mitochondrial (12S, 16S, ND1) and three nuclear markers (c-myc exon 2, RAG1, POMC) for a total of ∼4362 bp. Phylogenies were estimated using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses for individual genes and combined datasets. The separate analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear datasets allowed us to clarify the relationships within glassfrogs; also, we corroborate the sister-group relationship between Allophryne ruthveni and glassfrogs. The new phylogeny differs significantly from all previous morphology-based hypotheses of relationships, and shows that hypotheses based on few traits are likely to misrepresent evolutionary history. Traits previously hypothesized as unambiguous synapomorphies are shown to be homoplastic, and all genera in the current taxonomy (Centrolene, Cochranella, Hyalinobatrachium, Nymphargus) are found to be poly- or paraphyletic. The new topology implies a South American origin of glassfrogs and reveals allopatric speciation as the most important speciation mechanism. The phylogeny profoundly affects the traditional interpretations of glassfrog taxonomy, character evolution, and biogeography-topics that now require more extensive evaluation in future studies. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

An 800-bp mitochondrial DNA fragment, including a portion of COII, full tRNA-Lys, ATP8, and partial ATP6, was sequenced and analyzed for 96 individuals of the species and related taxa, resulting in a detailed framework of genetic differentiation in the northern half of the distribution of the complex. Phylogenetic analyses based on maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian optimality criteria found deep divergence between South American and Mesoamerican isolates, and seven differentiated populations corresponding to clear geographic breaks across the highlands of Mesoamerica. These distinct populations coincide with geographic structure found in previous analyses of morphological and molecular data for Chlorospingus ophthalmicus, as well as in previous phylogeographic studies of other taxa in the region. Species status for these populations is discussed under the evolutionary and biological species concepts. © 2008 The Authors.","Most of the recognized species of the genus Dionda inhabit drainages of the Gulf of Mexico from central Mexico to central Texas, USA, and have been considered a monophyletic group based on morphological, osteological, and allozyme investigations. Phylogenetic relationships of 15 species of Dionda and 34 species from closely related genera were inferred from one mitochondrial (cytb) and three nuclear gene sequences (S7, Rhodopsin, Rag1) totaling 4487 nucleotides. Separate analyses of all four genes yield congruent phylogenies; however the 15 putative species of Dionda evaluated were never recovered as a monophyletic group when species from nine related genera were included in the analyses. Among the ingroup taxa, one well-supported and highly divergent clade is consistently recognized and consists of six recognized and three undescribed northern species currently recognized in the genus Dionda. These nine species inhabit present or past tributaries of the Rio Grande basin of northern Mexico and southern USA, and were recovered as a basal clade in all analyses. Another large, also strongly supported clade, consisting of seven genera, include five southern recognized species currently in the genus Dionda, forming the sister group to the Codoma clade. These five species comprise the \"Southern Dionda clade\" and inhabit headwaters of the Pánuco-Tamesí drainage and some adjacent coastal rivers in the Tampico Embayment. The consistent and repeated identification of eight different clades recovered in most of the separate gene analyses strongly supports a division of the non-natural genus Dionda. A new genus, Tampichthys, is proposed for the clade of species endemic to east-central Mexico and formerly in Dionda. Tampichthys and the putative monotypic genus Codoma are more related to Mexican species of the genera Cyprinella and Notropis than to other species referred to Dionda sensu stricto. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Segments of three mitochondrial DNA genes (cytochrome b, ND2, and ND3) were sequenced for a total of 1,159 base pairs. Using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analysis, we found a set of seven differentiated populations that correspond to clear geographic breaks throughout the highlands of the Neotropics. These genetically distinct populations also correspond with the geographic breaks found in previous analyses of morphological data. Molecular evidence suggests species treatment for four of the Central American clades and three South American clades. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2008.","Familial, subfamilial, and tribal monophyly and relationships of aroids and duckweeds were assessed by parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of five regions of coding (rbcL, matK) and noncoding plastid DNA (partial trnK intron, trnL intron, trnL-trnF spacer) for exemplars of nearly all aroid and duckweed genera. Our analyses confirm the position of Lemna and its allies (formerly Lemnaceae) within Araceae as the well-supported sister group of all aroids except Gymnostachydoideae and Orontioideae. The last two subfamilies form the sister clade of the rest of the family. Monophyly of subfamilies Orontioideae, Pothoideae, Monsteroideae, and Lasioideae is supported, but Aroideae are paraphyletic if Calla is maintained in its own subfamily (Calloideae). Our results suggest expansion of the recently proposed subfamily Zamioculcadoideae (Zamioculcas, Gonatopus) to include Stylochaeton and identify problems in the current delimitation of tribes Anadendreae, Heteropsideae, and Monstereae (Monsteroideae), Caladieae/Zomicarpeae, and Colocasieae (Aroideae). Canalization of traits of the spathe and spadix considered typical of Araceae evolved after the split of Gymnostachydoideae, Orontioideae, and Lemnoideae. An association with aquatic habitats is a plesiomorphic attribute in Araceae, occurring in the helophytic Orontioideae and free-floating Lemnoideae, but evolving independently in various derived aroid lineages including free-floating Pistia (Aroideae).","The study of type III RNases constitutes an important area in molecular biology. It is known that the pac1+ gene encodes a particular RNase III that shares low amino acid similarity with other genes despite having a double-stranded ribonuclease activity. Bioinformatics memods based on sequence alignment may fail when there is a low amino acidic identity percentage between a query sequence and others with similar functions (remote homologues) or a similar sequence is not recorded in the database. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) applied to protein sequences may allow an alignment-independent prediction of protein function. These sequences of QS AR-like methods often use 1D sequence numerical parameters as the input to seek sequence-function relationships. However, previous 2D representation of sequences may uncover useful higher-order information. In the work described here we calculated for the first time the spectral moments of a Markov matrix (MMM) associated with a 2D-HP-map of a protein sequence. We used MMMs values to characterize numerically 81 sequences of type III RNases and 133 proteins of a control group. We subsequently developed one MMM-QSAR and one classic hidden Markov model (HMM) based on the same data. The MMM-QSAR showed a discrimination power of RNAses from other proteins of 97.35% without using alignment, which is a result as good as for the known HMM techniques. We also report for the first time the isolation of a new Pac1 protein (DQ647826) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe strain 428-4-1. The MMM-QSAR model predicts the new RNase III with the same accuracy as other classical alignment methods. Experimental assay of this protein confirms me predicted activity. The present results suggest that MMM-QSAR models may be used for protein function annotation avoiding sequence alignment with the same accuracy of classic HMM models. © 2008 American Chemical Society.","Peach palm (Bactris gasipaes Kunth.) is the only Neotropical palm domesticated since pre-Columbian times. It plays an important role not only at the local level due to its very nutritious fruits, but also in the international market for its gourmet palm heart. Phylogenetic relationships of the peach palm with wild Bactris taxa are still in doubt, and have never been addressed using molecular sequence data. We generated a chloroplast DNA phylogeny using intergenic spacers from a sampling of cultivars of Bactris gasipaes as well as putative wild relatives and other members of the genus Bactris. We estimated phylogenetic relationships using maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian analysis. Our results indicated a close affinity between three taxa: Bactris gasipaes var. gasipaes, B. gasipaes var. chichagui, and B. riparia. There was no clear differentiation between these three taxa at the level of chloroplast sequences, and they shared a unique inversion that we characterized in this paper. Bactris setulosa, a species potentially related to the Bactris gasipaes complex, appeared highly divergent, and seemed to be a composite taxon with affinities outside the complex. We also investigated nuclear microsatellite polymorphisms at 8 loci within Bactris gasipaes, B. riparia, and B. setulosa, finding a pattern of relationships in agreement with the cpDNA data. The results presented here are important for future studies on domestication and crop improvement of Bactris gasipaes. © Copyright 2007 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.","Rationale: From general practitioners to academic staff, clinicians continue to have difficulties in applying clinical epidemiology in their everyday work. They do not fully understand the logical rules behind the numbers and they do not recognize these rules in their work. We present a new model where the pre-test and the post-test probabilities are converted to log 10 of odds, and the likelihood ratio (LR) to its own log 10. Methods: Following Bayes' theorem, adding the log10LR to the log10 pre-test odds gives the log10 post-test odds, which can easily be represented on a logarithmic scale. In addition, by rounding the log10LR to half the unit, we create classes of discriminative power of tests, close to intuitive estimation. This model generates also a user-friendly diagram, adding considerably to the understanding of Bayes' theorem. We evaluated the effect of the rounding, the current use of the classical model and the acceptability of the new model. Results: Rounding 10 disease characteristics to half the unit gives an absolute error of less than half a unit. After six explanations of Bayes' theorem, only 6/16 medical students were capable of answering simple questions about predictive value. When asked about weight of disease characteristics, no one of the 50 clinicians mentioned sensitivity, specificity, predictive value or LR. With the new model, more than 80% of trainees found medical decision making easier to understand and recognized the theory in their practice. Conclusions: We conclude that our model of diagnostic clinical epidemiology offers a logical environment for an easy and rapid assessment of the evolution of disease probability with consecutive tests, providing a scientific format for 'qualitative' clinical estimations. © 2007 The Authors.","In this paper we study how shape information encoded in contour energy components values can be used for detection of microscopic organisms in population images. We proposed features based on shape and geometrical statistical data obtained from samples of optimized contour lines integrated in the framework of Bayesian inference for recognition of individual specimens. Compared with common geometric features the results show that patterns present in the image allow better detection of a considerable amount of individuals even in cluttered regions when sufficient shape information is retained. Therefore providing an alternative to building a specific shape model or imposing specific constrains on the interaction of overlapping objects. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.","Volcanic islands represent excellent models with which to study the effect of vicariance on colonization and dispersal, particularly when the evolution of genetic diversity mirrors the sequence of geological events that led to island formation. Phylogeographic inference, however, can be particularly challenging for recent dispersal events within islands, where the antagonistic effects of land bridge formation and vicariance can affect movements of organisms with limited dispersal ability. We investigated levels of genetic divergence and recovered signatures of dispersal events for 631 Galápagos giant tortoises across the volcanoes of Sierra Negra and Cerro Azul on the island of Isabela. These volcanoes are among the most recent formations in the Galápagos (<0.7 million years), and previous studies based on genetic and morphological data could not recover a consistent pattern of lineage sorting. We integrated nested clade analysis of mitochondrial DNA control region sequences, to infer historical patterns of colonization, and a novel Bayesian multilocus genotyping method for recovering evidence of recent migration across volcanoes using eleven microsatellite loci. These genetic studies illuminate taxonomic distinctions as well as provide guidance to possible repatriation programs aimed at countering the rapid population declines of these spectacular animals.

The species has been listed as critically endangered due to habitat deterioration and predation by introduced mammals. Significant morphological and behavioural differences among petrels nesting on different islands suggest that island populations may differ genetically. Furthermore, nesting phenology suggests that genetically differentiated seasonal populations may exist within at least one island. We analysed variation in six microsatellite loci and part of the mitochondrial ATPase 6/8 gene in 206 Galápagos petrels sampled from all five islands. No evidence of genetic structuring within islands was found, although statistical power was low. In contrast, significant differences occurred among island populations. For the microsatellite loci, private alleles occurred at all islands, sometimes at high frequency; global and pairwise estimates of genetic differentiation were all statistically significant; Bayesian analysis of genotypes frequencies provided strong support for three genetic populations; and most estimates of migration between populations did not differ significantly from zero. Only two ATPase haplotypes were found, but the geographic distribution of haplotypes indicated significant differentiation among populations. For conservation purposes, populations from Floreana, Santa Cruz, San Cristóbal and Santiago should be regarded as separate genetic management units. Birds from Isabela appear to be derived recently from the Santiago population, and the population on San Cristóbal appears to be a mixture of birds from other populations. However, considering ecological and behavioural differences among birds from different islands, we recommend that all five populations be protected. © Springer 2006.","We present individual body identification efforts, to identify skeletal remains and relatives of missing persons of an explosion took place inside one of the munitions recesses of the Armoured Brigade of the Galapagos Armoured Cavalry, in the city of Riobamba, Ecuador, on Wednesday, November 20, 2002. Nineteen samples of bone remains and two tissue samples (a blood stain on a piece of fabric) from the zero zone were analysed. DNA extraction was made by Isoamilic Phenol-Chloroform-Alcohol, and proteinase K. We increased PCR cycles to identify DNA from bones to 35 cycles in some cases. An ABI 310 sequencer was used. Determination of the fragment size and the allelic designation of the different loci was carried out by comparison with the allelic ladders of the PowerPlex©16 kit and Gene Scan Analysis Software® programme. Five possible family groups were established and were compared with the profiles found. Classical Bayesian methods were used to calculate the Likelihood Ratio and it was possible to identify five different genetic profiles in our country.

The reasonable maximum errors, and in turn the uncertainties of the measured phase-difference values, depend mainly on the global effect of the optical noise and the environmental perturbations. Objectively, this effect can be characterized by repeatedly measuring the phase-difference; however, the phase-difference measuring process is not usually repeatedly performed. In this case, the scarcity of experimental data forces us to consider all the available information sources, objective and subjective, to estimate both the reasonable maximum error and the uncertainty. In this work, we evaluate the uncertainty associated with phase-difference values measured from fringe patterns generated by Moiré interferometry and by electronic speckle-pattern interferometry (ESPI); each measurement was performed only once using the conventional phase-shifting technique of four frames. Since the apparent lack of experimental information, we incorporated in the uncertainty evaluation procedure the estimations of experts on what the reasonable maximum error associated with each measurement should be. We argue that the incorporation of these estimations allowed us to consider the influence of some error sources that otherwise could be difficult to include explicitly. The used method for the uncertainty evaluation gives theoretical support to the expert intuition since it satisfies the formalities of the Bayesian statistic inference. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The pdf can be inferred from the dispersion of unbiased observations obtained by repeatedly measuring the quantity involved. If the quantity is not repeatedly measured, the apparent scarcity of experimental data may require consideration of information other than experimental data to assign the pdf and to evaluate the uncertainty; in this context, an evaluator tends intuitively to consider information linked with his experience. In this work, we report on a method, based on the theorem of Bayes, to assign the pdf and to evaluate the uncertainty of a quantity measured only once. This method allows us to include in the uncertainty evaluation the information concerning the evaluator's experience. It gives theoretical support to the intuition since it satisfies the formalities of statistical inference.

Seven of them were polymorphic, which led us to investigate several population-genetic parameters. Private alleles and significant differences in gene frequencies were found among the populations studied, which demonstrated the extent of genetic differentiation among the spectacled bear populations. The levels of gene diversity measured with these microsatellites were rather modest in this species. Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium was especially found for the overall and the Ecuadorian samples, and might be due to the Wahlund effect or consanguinity. Significant genetic heterogeneity was mainly observed among the Colombian and the Ecuadorian populations.
