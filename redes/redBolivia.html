Biodiversity modelling is a key tool for the integration of these drivers and the predictions generated are essential, for example, for climate change forecast and conservation planning. However, the reliability of biodiversity models at the local scale remains poorly understood, especially in tropical species-rich areas, where they are required. We inventoried all woody plants with stems ≥ 2.5 cm in 397 plots across the Andes-Amazon gradient. We generated and mapped 19 uncorrelated biodiversity drivers at 90 m resolution, grouped into four categories: microclimatic, microtopographic, anthropic, and edaphic. In order to evaluate the importance of the different categories, we grouped biodiversity drivers into four different clusters by categories. For each of the four clusters of biodiversity drivers, we modelled the observed species richness using two statistical techniques (random forest and Bayesian inference) and two modelling procedures (including or excluding a spatial component). All the biodiversity models produced were evaluated by cross-validation. Species richness was accurately predicted by random forest (Spearman correlation up to 0.85 and explained variance up to 67%). The results suggest that precipitation and temperature are important driving forces of species richness in the region. Nonetheless, a spatial component should be considered to properly predict biodiversity. This could reflect macroevolutionary underlying forces not considered here, such as colonization time, dispersal capacities, or speciation rates. However, the proposed biodiversity modelling approach can predict accurately species richness at the local scale and detailed resolution (90 m) in tropical areas, something that previous works had found extremely challenging. The innovative methodology presented here could be employed in other areas with conservation needs. © 2022","<b>Phylogeny of Telmatobius marmoratus complex (Anura, Telmatobiidae) reveals high cryptic diversity in the Andean Altiplano<\/b><br><br>Telmatobius is the most diverse group of anurans in the Andean Altiplano (highlands) Morphologically, these amphibians have a generally conserved morphology but in turn present large intraspecific variation, which has led to a complex taxonomy and systematics. T. marmoratus has the widest distribution of the genus and forms a complex composed of at least two Telmatobius species. Partial systematic studies based on molecular evidence reveal the existence of three lineages with a complex spatial distribution. However, these studies did not include the entire distribution of T. marmoratus. Our study aims to reassess the current systematic scenario including the complete distribution of the complex. For this, we used a multilocus approach based on mitochondrial (16S, Cytb) and nuclear (RAG1-1, BFIB) DNA sequences to build a phylogenetic hypothesis based on Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony. Subsequently, we performed single-locus (ABGD and PTP) and multilocus (STACEY) species delimitation analyses to verify the diversity of nominal species within the complex. The analyses suggest seven non-sibling lineages and 6–10 candidate species within the marmoratus complex. Only one of the two lineages restricted to the central northern plateau correspond to T. marmoratus sensu stricto. South-central marbled water frogs belong to completely new lineages closer to T. gigas and T. culeus, evidencing the polyphyletic condition of the marmoratus complex. The findings of several sympatric lineages in some localities reveal a complex history of ancient water connections in south-central Altiplano. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Are birds more afraid in urban parks or cemeteries? A Latin American study contrasts with results from Europe<\/b><br><br>The escape behaviour, measured as flight initiation distance (FID; the distance at which individuals take flight when approached by a potential predator, usually a human in the study systems), is a measure widely used to study fearfulness and risk-taking in animals. Previous studies have shown significant differences in the escape behaviour of birds inhabiting cemeteries and urban parks in European cities, where birds seem to be shyer in the latter. We collected a regional dataset of the FID of birds inhabiting cemeteries and parks across Latin America in peri-urban, suburban and urban parks and cemeteries. FIDs were recorded for eighty-one bird species. Mean species-specific FIDs ranged from 1.9 to 19.7 m for species with at least two observations (fifty-seven species). Using Bayesian regression modelling and controlling for the phylogenetic relatedness of the FID among bird species and city and country, we found that, in contrast to a recent publication from Europe, birds escape earlier in cemeteries than parks in the studied Latin American cities. FIDs were also significantly shorter in urban areas than in peri-urban areas and in areas with higher human density. Our results indicate that some idiosyncratic patterns in animal fearfulness towards humans may emerge among different geographic regions, highlighting difficulties with scaling up and application of regional findings to other ecosystems and world regions. Such differences could be associated with intrinsic differences between the pool of bird species from temperate European and mostly tropical Latin American cities, characterized by different evolutionary histories, but also with differences in the historical process of urbanization. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","<b>Distribution shifts in habitat suitability and hotspot refugia of Andean tree species from the last glacial maximum to the Anthropocene<\/b><br><br>Forecasting the effects of climate change on the distribution of Andean trees (Polylepis, Rosaceae) is important to understand how species respond to climate variability and to assess their resilience to the ongoing climate crisis. Here, paleodistribution modelling is used to assess distribution shifts of 17 Polylepis species during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), mid-Holocene (MH), and the Anthropocene in the central Andes. Species distribution models (SDMs) were computed by combining presence records and current climatic conditions using Maxent and projected onto three climatic scenarios for the LGM (~22,000 yr BP), the MH (~6,000 yr BP), and the Anthropocene (1,970–2,000). Subsequently, current refugia hotspots were identified by intersecting suitable habitat over the LGM, MH, and anthropogenic conditions for all the studied species. SDMs for the LGM and MH showed a contraction of climate suitable habitat for most of the species in comparison to the Anthropocene. Four current refugia hotspots were identified: central Cordillera of Peru, Lake Titicaca basin, western Cordillera of Bolivia, and northern Chile. In general, SDMs were consistent with patterns proposed with pollen records, and partially with available phylogeographic studies. Current hotspots are highly important areas for the conservation of Polylepis and associated biota. This study assists in understanding distribution shifts over millennia of Andean tree species in response to climate change and identifying key conservation areas for the delineation of future conservation strategies. © 2021 The Author(s).

Ceratozygum horridum (Germar, 1839) is a little-known species with scarce occurrence data but presenting a broad and discontinuous distribution in Amazon and Atlantic Forest, lacking records in the dry diagonal. Field trips in Bolivia registered new records of C. horridum in an ecotone between the Southwest Amazon forest, the Chiquitano Dry Forest and the Dry Chaco forest. We used the maximum entropy algorithm aiming to model the occurrence probability of C. horridum on the Amazon Forest and transferred this model to the dry diagonal and the Atlantic Forest looking for continuous areas of probable occurrence for this species. We used ten records for a constrained portion of the Amazon forests and four environmental layers to train models with different numbers of background points. The average model performances returned AUC values higher than 0.7 and maximum sensitivity was reached. The models could not predict species occurrence with reliability when transferred to the whole Amazon area, dry diagonal, and the Atlantic Forests. Our findings suggest a low probability of occurrence of C. horridum in the dry diagonal, supporting the hypothesis that the Amazon and Atlantic Forests populations are isolated by the dry diagonal. The populations of C. horridum seem to be isolated in small spots with dissimilar ecological features across the complex ecoregions of the Neotropics. Building species distribution models for species with poorly known distribution is challenging and may raise more questions than light answers. Even the small pieces of evidence are pertinent to the knowledge of rare species like C. horridum. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:author:E11F3EE3-C93F-40EB-AC68-AD1B7C954E5E. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","<b>Interaction of economic policy. Lessons on social welfare and risk premium<\/b><br><br>The Purpose of this paper is to quantify the impacts on social welfare and risk premium, by combination and alternatives to interactions of economic policy: fiscal-monetary, fiscal-exchange and monetary for the Bolivian case. There are also considered unidirectional economic policies with counterfactual analysis without interaction. The estimates are presented by a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model with the incorporation of Bayesian structural autoregressive vectors (SVAR). The findings suggest that the fiscal-monetary interaction generates 79% of variability in social welfare, while the unidirectional exchange rate policy is a relevant factor for Risk premium of more than 84%. In the absence of economic policy interaction, productivity shocks are the most relevant. © 2021, Economic Laboratory for Transition Research.

Randomized control trials (RCTs) provide particularly robust evidence of the effectiveness of interventions (although they have been criticized as reductionist and unable to provide insights into mechanisms), but there have been few such experiments investigating conservation at the landscape scale. We explored the impact of Watershared, an incentive-based conservation program in the Bolivian Andes, with one of the few RCTs of landscape-scale conservation in existence. There is strong interest in such incentive-based conservation approaches as some argue they can avoid negative social impacts sometimes associated with protected areas. We focused on social and environmental outcomes based on responses from a household survey in 129 communities randomly allocated to control or treatment (conducted both at the baseline in 2010 and repeated in 2015–2016). We controlled for incomplete program uptake by combining standard RCT analysis with matching methods and investigated mechanisms by exploring intermediate and ultimate outcomes according to the underlying theory of change. Previous analyses, focused on single biophysical outcomes, showed that over its first 5 years Watershared did not slow deforestation or improve water quality at the landscape scale. We found that Watershared influenced some outcomes measured using the survey, but the effects were complex, and some were unexpected. We thus demonstrated how RCTs can provide insights into the pathways of impact, as well as whether an intervention has impact. This paper, one of the first registered reports in conservation science, demonstrates how preregistration can help make complex research designs more transparent, avoid cherry picking, and reduce publication bias. © 2020 Society for Conservation Biology","<b>Evolution between forest macrorefugia is linked to discordance between genetic and morphological variation in Neotropical passerines<\/b><br><br>The central Andean rainforests and the Atlantic Forest are two similar biomes that are fully isolated by xerophytic and open-vegetation regions (the Chaco and Cerrado, respectively). Even though there is evidence suggesting that these rainforests have been connected in the past, their dynamics of connection, the geographic areas that bridged these regions, and the biological processes that have promoted diversification between them remain to be studied. In this research, we used three passerine species (Poecilotriccus plumbeiceps, Phylloscartes ventralis and Cacicus chrysopterus) as models to address whether the Andean and the Atlantic forests have acted as a refugia system (macrorefugia), and to evaluate biogeographic hypotheses of diversification and connection between them. In order to achieve these goals, we performed traditional phylogeographic analyses and compared alternative biogeographic scenarios by using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Additionally, we performed morphological analyses to evaluate phenotypic divergence between these regions. Our findings support that both rainforest regions acted as refugia, but that the impact of their isolation was stronger on the genetic than on the morphologic characters. Our results provided evidence that both geographic isolation as well as ecological factors have modeled the external traits of forest organisms in the region. Regarding the connection routes between the Andes and the Atlantic Forest, the genetic data rejected the hypothesis of a Chaco connection in the tested species, providing evidence for a connection through the Cerrado or through the transition between the Cerrado and Chaco, in a process that could have started as early as the Late Miocene. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","<b>The interaction effect of gender and ethnicity in loan approval: A Bayesian estimation with data from a laboratory field experiment<\/b><br><br>Microfinance targets women and uses loan provision as a tool for empowerment, which translates into better household nutrition, improved education, and a scale down of domestic violence. However, ethnic discrimination in microfinance may exist in countries with a segregated indigenous population. We assessed this possibility with a field experiment in Bolivia. The controlled laboratory experiment evaluated whether credit officers rejected microloan applications based on the interaction effect of ethnicity and gender of potential borrowers. Point estimates of a Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression, estimated with the experimental data, indicate that nonindigenous women have double the chance of loan approval, but indigenous women have only 1.5 times the chance of loan approval when compared with men. While the findings about gender are limited, the evidence for the interaction of gender and ethnicity is more robust and suggests the existence of positive taste-based discrimination favorable for nonethnic women in Bolivia. We conclude that the affirmative actions towards women promoted by development agencies and microfinance institutions must not overlook ethnicity as an important factor for financial policies of sustainable development. In practice, these policies should be aimed at identifying and reducing both social desirability bias and the structural barriers to financial inclusion that indigenous women may face when trying to obtain access to a loan. © 2019 The Authors.

Developing tools for the genetic identification of Dipteryx species and their geographical origin can help to promote legal trading of timber. A collection of 800 individual trees, belonging to 6 different Dipteryx species, was genotyped based on 171 molecular markers. After the exclusion of markers out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or with no polymorphism or low amplification, 83 nuclear, 29 chloroplast, 13 mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and 2 chloroplast and 5 mitochondrial INDELS remained. Six genetic groups were identified using Bayesian Structure analyses of the nuclear SNPs, which corresponded to the different Dipteryx species collected in the field. Seventeen highly informative markers were identified as suitable for species identification and obtained self-assignment success rates to species level of 78-96%. An additional set of 15 molecular markers was selected to determine the different genetic clusters found in Dipteryx odorata and Dipteryx ferrea, obtaining self-assignment success rates of 91-100%. The success to assign samples to the correct country of origin using all or only the informative markers improved when using the nearest neighbor approach (69-92%) compared to the Bayesian approach (33-80%). While nuclear and chloroplast SNPs were more suitable for differentiating the different Dipteryx species, mitochondrial SNPs were ideal for determining the genetic clusters of D. odorata and D. ferrea. These 32 selected SNPs will be invaluable genetic tools for the accurate identification of species and country of origin of Dipteryx timber. © The American Genetic Association 2020.

Despite its great morphological diversity and complex taxonomic history, a robust phylogenetic estimate is still lacking for this group. Here, we study the morphological and molecular diversity of the L. montanus group and present the most complete quantitative phylogenetic hypothesis for the group to date. Our phylogeny includes 103 terminal taxa, of which 91 are members of the L. montanus group (58 are assigned to available species and 33 are of uncertain taxonomic status). Our matrix includes 306 morphological and ecological characters and 3057 molecular characters. Morphological characters include 48 continuous and 258 discrete characters, of which 70% (216) are new to the literature. The molecular characters represent five mitochondrial markers. We performed three analyses: A morphology-only matrix, a molecular-only matrix and a matrix including both morphological and molecular characters (total evidence hypothesis). Our total evidence hypothesis recovered the L. montanus group as monophyletic and included ≥ 12 major clades, revealing an unexpectedly complex phylogeny. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.","<b>Gomphrena (Amaranthaceae, Gomphrenoideae) diversified as a C4 lineage in the New World tropics with specializations in floral and inflorescence morphology, and an escape to Australia<\/b><br><br>The genus Gomphrena comprises about 120 species in the Americas and 35 in Australia. Previous research revealed that Gossypianthus, Lithophila and Philoxerus are closely related but the monophyly of Gomphrena remained unresolved. Our aim was to clarify phylogenetic relationships in Gomphrena and allies based on a thorough sampling of species and to reconstruct the evolution of morphological characters including C4 photosynthesis, and to explore the disjunction of the Australian taxa. We generated datasets of plastid (matK-trnK, trnL-F, rpl16) and nrITS representing 45 taxa of Gomphrena plus relatives and analysed them with parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian methods. Ancestral states of phenotypic characters were reconstructed with BayesTraits. BEAST was employed for divergence time estimates using an extended Amaranthaceae - Chenopodiaceae dataset to place fossil calibration points. Gossypianthus is closely related to a Gomphrena radiata - G. umbellata - G. tomentosa clade and G. meyeniana, whereas Lithophila and Philoxerus appear as successive sisters of the Australian species of Gomphrena. The majority of Andean species appears in a large clade including annual and perennial species. The Cerrado species Gomphrena mollis and G. rupestris, which are C3, constitute an early-branching lineage, whereas the core Gomphrena clade is C4 and has the inner two sepals strongly compressed as synapomorphy. A major subclade evolved inflorescences with subglobose paracladia in a whorl, supported by pseudanthial leaves. Whereas the core Gomphrena clade started to diversify around 11.4 Ma (8.45 - 14.5 95 % highest posterior density [HPD]) the Australian lineage split at only 4.8 Ma (2.61 - 7.18 HPD). Our detailed phylogenetic analysis of Gomphrena depicts 10 major lineages including segregate genera. We hypothesize that an adaptation to costal habitats was followed by long-distance dispersal to Australia. We also propose a revised genus concept of Gomphrena including Gossypianthus, Lithophila and Philoxerus, considering that these small segregate genera were based on states of vegetative characters exhibiting adaptations to specific habitats rather than phylogeny and overall morphology. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Phylogenetic analyses of Ameerega are highly discordant, lacking consistency due to variation in data types and methods, and often with limited coverage of species diversity in the genus. Here, we present a comprehensive phylogenomic reconstruction of Ameerega, utilizing state-of-the-art sequence capture techniques and phylogenetic methods. We sequenced thousands of ultraconserved elements from over 100 tissue samples, representing almost every described Ameerega species, as well as undescribed cryptic diversity. We generated topologies using maximum likelihood and coalescent methods and compared the use of maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods for estimating divergence times. Our phylogenetic inference diverged strongly from those of previous studies, and we recommend steps to bring Ameerega taxonomy in line with the new phylogeny. We place several species in a phylogeny for the first time, as well as provide evidence for six potential candidate species. We estimate that Ameerega experienced a rapid radiation approximately 7–11 million years ago and that the ancestor of all Ameerega was likely an aposematic, montane species. This study underscores the utility of phylogenomic data in improving our understanding of the phylogeny of understudied clades and making novel inferences about their evolution. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Genetic diversification of Panstrongylus geniculatus (Reduviidae: Triatominae) in northern South America<\/b><br><br>Triatomines are the vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Although Triatoma and Rhodnius are the most-studied vector genera, other triatomines, such as Panstrongylus, also transmit T. cruzi, creating new epidemiological scenarios. Panstrongylus has at least 13 reported species but there is limited information about its intraspecific genetic variation and patterns of diversification. Here, we begin to fill this gap by studying populations of P. geniculatus from Colombia and Venezuela and including other epidemiologically important species from the region. We examined the pattern of diversification of P. geniculatus in Colombia using mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal data. Genetic diversity and differentiation were calculated within and among populations of P. geniculatus. Moreover, we constructed maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference phylogenies and haplotype networks using P. geniculatus and other species from the genus (P. megistus, P. lignarius, P. lutzi, P. tupynambai, P. chinai, P. rufotuberculatus and P. howardi). Using a coalescence framework, we also dated the P. geniculatus lineages. The total evidence tree showed that P. geniculatus is a monophyletic species, with four clades that are concordant with its geographic distribution and are partly explained by the Andes orogeny. However, other factors, including anthropogenic and eco-epidemiological effects must be investigated to explain the existence of recent geographic P. geniculatus lineages. The epidemiological dynamics in structured vector populations, such as those found here, warrant further investigation. Extending our knowledge of P. geniculatus is necessary for the accurate development of effective strategies for the control of Chagas disease vectors. © 2019 Caicedo-Garzón et al.","<b>Genetic differences among Cedrela odorata sites in Bolivia provide limited potential for fine-scale timber tracing<\/b><br><br>Illegal trade of tropical timber leads to biodiversity and economic losses worldwide. There is a need for forensic tools that allow tracing the origin of timber and verifying compliance with international and national regulations. We evaluated the potential for genetic tracing of Cedrela odorata, one of the most traded neotropical timbers, within Bolivia. Using a set of seven microsatellites (SSRs), we studied the spatial distribution and genetic diversity and tested whether populations show sufficient genetic discrimination for timber tracing at a national level. Cambium and leaves were sampled from 81 C. odorata trees from three sites, at 268–501-km distance. To explore genetic differentiation, Bayesian clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) were employed. To infer the origin of samples, we conducted kernel discriminant analysis (KDA) based on a PCA that included all alleles and a manual assessment of site-unique alleles. The PCA showed three distinct genetic clusters, but only one of them corresponded with one of the sampled sites. The KDA based on allele frequency had a 33.7% mean classification error, with a considerably lower error (8.2%) for the site which matched with one genetic cluster. The blind test on unique alleles led to a similar classification error (30%). The occurrence of multiple genetic clusters within sites suggests that Bolivian C. odorata populations contain several parental lines, resulting in limited potential for forensic tracing at a national level. Based on our findings, we recommend for additional sampling across the spatial range of C. odorata within the country to support the development of forensic techniques for this species. © 2019, The Author(s).","<b>A New Species of Johngarthia from Clipperton and Socorro Islands in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (Crustacea: Decapoda: Gecarcinidae)<\/b><br><br>The taxonomy of the East Pacific land crab Johngarthia planata (Stimpson, 1860) is reviewed and a neotype designated to stabilize the taxonomy of this species. The population of J. planata is found to be restricted to inshore islands and the continental mainland coast of the tropical and subtropical Pacific coast of America. A new species, Johngarthia oceanica sp. nov., is described for populations that occur on the oceanic Clipperton and Socorro islands. Johngarthia oceanica sp. nov., can be separated from J. planata by the broad, subrectangular mesial lobe of the infraorbital margin (narrow, subtriangular in J. planata) and a dorsal carapace that is dark yellow to brightly orange with or without black areas of different extension (homogeneously red to maroon in J. planata). The distribution of J. planata is modeled using MaxEnt and the biogeography of East Pacific species of Johngarthia is discussed. The conservation status of the Clipperton population of J. oceanica sp. nov. deserves special attention because this population may be threatened by introduced rats. © 2019 by University of Hawai'i Press.

To achieve these goals we selected the Buff-browed Foliage-gleaner Syndactyla rufosuperciliata (Aves, Furnariidae) as a study system, a taxon distributed between the Andean and Atlantic forest. We first explored the historical connectivity between regions through niche modeling. We subsequently used DNA sequences (n = 71 individuals) and genomic analyses (ddRADseq, n = 33 individuals) to evaluate population genetic structure and gene flow within this species. Finally, we performed population model selection using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Our findings indicate that the Andean and the Atlantic forests acted as refugia, and that the populations of the focal species from both regions contacted through the Cerrado region, thus suggesting that the historical dynamics of Andean and Atlantic forests are important for the evolution of forest birds in the region. The results are in agreement with studies of other organisms and may indicate a more general pattern of connectivity among biomes in the Neotropics. Finally, we recommend recognizing both the Andean and the Altantic forests lineages of S. rufosuperciliata as independent species. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","<b>The Hyalella (Crustacea: Amphipoda) species cloud of the ancient Lake Titicaca originated from multiple colonizations<\/b><br><br>Ancient lakes are renowned for their exceptional diversity of endemic species. As model systems for the study of sympatric speciation, it is necessary to understand whether a given hypothesized species flock is of monophyletic or polyphyletic origin. Here, we present the first molecular characterization of the Hyalella (Crustacea: Amphipoda) species complex of Lake Titicaca, using COI and 28S DNA sequences, including samples from the connected Small and Large Lakes that comprise Lake Titicaca as well as from a broader survey of southern South American sites. At least five evolutionarily distant lineages are present within Lake Titicaca, which were estimated to have diverged from one another 12–20 MYA. These major lineages are dispersed throughout the broader South American Hyalella phylogeny, with each lineage representing at least one independent colonization of the lake. Moreover, complex genetic relationships are revealed between Lake Titicaca individuals and those from surrounding water bodies, which may be explained by repeated dispersal into and out of the lake, combined with parallel intralacustrine diversification within two separate clades. Although further work in deeper waters will be required to determine the number of species present and modes of diversification, our results strongly indicate that this amphipod species cloud is polyphyletic with a complex geographic history. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Genetic structuring in a Neotropical palm analyzed through an Andean orogenesis-scenario<\/b><br><br>Andean orogenesis has driven the development of very high plant diversity in theNeotropics through its impact on landscape evolution and climate. The analysis ofthe intraspecific patterns of genetic structure in plants would permit inferring theeffects of Andean uplift on the evolution and diversification of Neotropical flora. Inthis study, using microsatellite markers and Bayesian clustering analyses, we reportthe presence of four genetic clusters for the palm Oenocarpus bataua var. batauawhich are located within four biogeographic regions in northwestern South America:(a) Chocó rain forest, (b) Amotape-Huancabamba Zone, (c) northwestern Amazonianrain forest, and (d) southwestern Amazonian rain forest. We hypothesize that theseclusters developed following three genetic diversification events mainly promoted byAndean orogenic events. Additionally, the distinct current climate dynamics amongnorthwestern and southwestern Amazonia may maintain the genetic diversificationdetected in the western Amazon basin. Genetic exchange was identified betweenthe clusters, including across the Andes region, discarding the possibility of any cluster to diversify as a distinct intraspecific variety. We identified a hot spot of geneticdiversity in the northern Peruvian Amazon around the locality of Iquitos. We alsodetected a decrease in diversity with distance from this area in westward and southward direction within the Amazon basin and the eastern Andean foothills. Additionally,we confirmed the existence and divergence of O. bataua var. bataua from var. oligocarpus in northern South America, possibly expanding the distributional range of thelatter variety beyond eastern Venezuela, to the central and eastern Andean cordilleras of Colombia. Based on our results, we suggest that Andean orogenesis is themain driver of genetic structuring and diversification in O. bataua within northwestern South America. © 2018 The Authors.","<b>The geographical diversification of Furnariides: the role of forest versus open habitats in driving species richness gradients<\/b><br><br>Aim: Explaining species richness gradients in space and time requires understanding the evolutionary processes that ultimately alter the number of species. Here we examine species richness differences between primary habitats (forest versus open) for Furnariides birds, a Neotropical endemic bird clade, to test three major historical hypotheses – diversification rate, out of the tropics and tropical niche conservatism – and assess the role of evolutionary processes in driving the Furnariides species richness gradient. Location: Neotropics. Methods: We used phylogenetic and spatial data to tests the historical hypotheses. First, we used GeoSSE and Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixture models to evaluate differential diversification and dispersal rates between habitats. Second, we quantify the root distance of each species and examined the phylogenetic structure of the richness gradient and the correlation between total species richness and the richness of early-diverged and recently originated species. Results: Furnariides species richness is higher in forest than in open habitats. However, we found higher speciation, extinction, and dispersal rates in open when compared to forest habitats, resulting in a higher diversification rate in open habitats and higher dispersal rate out of open habitats than into them. The phylogenetic structure of the richness gradient showed strong spatial pattern, with early diverged species richness peaking in forest habitats and driving the overall Furnariides gradient. Main conclusions: The Furnariides species richness gradient results from the joint effect of differential rates of macroevolutionary processes. Our findings highlight dispersal and extinction as dominant forces driving richness differences between habitats, through the addition and extirpation of species from open to forest habitats. Differences in species richness between habitats support niche conservatism of forest habitat preferences of Furnariides species. We suggest that open habitats are effective evolutionary arenas and a key to the maintenance of bird diversity in forest habitats over evolutionary time. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","<b>The niche and phylogeography of a passerine reveal the history of biological diversification between the Andean and the Atlantic forests<\/b><br><br>The Atlantic Forest is separated from the Andean tropical forest by dry and open vegetation biomes (Chaco and Cerrado). Despite this isolation, both rainforests share closely related lineages, which suggest a past connection. This connection could have been important for forest taxa evolution. In this study, we used the Saffron-billed Sparrow (Arremon flavirostris) as a model to evaluate whether the Andean and the Atlantic forests act as a refugia system, as well as to test for a history of biogeographic connection between them. In addition, we evaluated the molecular systematic of intraspecific lineages of the studied species. We modeled the current and past distribution of A. flavirostris, performed phylogeographic analyses based on mitochondrial and nuclear genes, and used Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) analyses to test for biogeographic scenarios. The major phylogeographic disjunction within A. flavirostris was found between the Andean and the Atlantic forests, with a divergence that occurred during the Mid-Pleistocene. Our paleodistribution models indicated a connection between these forest domains in different periods and through both the Chaco and Cerrado. Additionally, the phylogeographic and ABC analyses supported that the Cerrado was the main route of connection between these rainforests, but without giving decisive evidence against a Chaco connection. Our study with A. flavirostris suggest that the biodiversity of the Andean and of the Atlantic forests could have been impacted (and perhaps enriched?) by cycles of connections through the Cerrado and Chaco. This recurrent cycle of connection between the Andean and the Atlantic Forest could have been important for the evolution of Neotropical forest taxa. In addition, we discussed taxonomic implications of the results and proposed to split the studied taxon into two full species. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Ecotypic differentiation under farmers' selection: Molecular insights into the domestication of Pachyrhizus Rich. ex DC.

Yam beans (Pachyrhizus Rich. ex DC.) are leguminous crops native to South and Central America that are grown for their tuberous roots but are seed-propagated. Using a landscape genetic approach, we examined correlations between environmental factors and phylogeographic patterns of genetic diversity in Pachyrhizus landrace populations. Molecular analyses based on chloroplast DNA sequencing and a new set of nuclear microsatellite markers revealed two distinct lineages, with strong genetic differentiation between Andean landraces (lineage A) and Amazonian landraces (lineage B). The comparison of different evolutionary scenarios for the diversification history of yam beans in the Andes using approximate Bayesian computation suggests that Pachyrhizus ahipa and Pachyrhizus tuberosus share a progenitor-derivative relationship, with environmental factors playing an important role in driving selection for divergent ecotypes. The new molecular data call for a revision of the taxonomy of Pachyrhizus but are congruent with paleoclimatic and archeological evidence, and suggest that selection for determinate growth was part of ecophysiological adaptations associated with the diversification of the P. tuberosus–P. ahipa complex during the Mid-Holocene. © 2017 The Authors.

I-O tables can be unbalanced if the sum of its columns (total input destination) does not equal the sum of its rows (total output). An artificial Ant Colony (ACO) algorithm based on Bayesian slave-making polymorphus ants is proposed for balancing an I-O matrix. The approach is inspired on the behavior of Rossomyrmex minuchae, a parasite ant that enslaves other species of ants (Proformica) which in turn choose an optimal path between their colony and the source of food by leaving a trace of pheromones. In the algorithm, an improvement in the balance of I-O accounts increase the pheromones, thus raising the probability of ants moving towards the equilibrium of the matrix. An application to a real I-O matrix and Monte Carlo experiments were performed to evaluate the proposed ACO algorithm. The results showed that slave-raiding ACO can be used by statistical offices as an automated algorithm to produce more timely and reliable I-O tables. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

In order to understand the phylogeographic patterns of Octodontomys gliroides, we sequenced 579 bp of the mitochondrial DNA control region from 100 individuals collected from 20 populations across its entire distributional range. The phylogenetic and parsimony network, in conjunction with analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), revealed a structured pattern of geographic differentiation of O. gliroides, with the occurrence of two well-defined evolutionary lineages: lineage A, restricted to Bolivia and Chile, and lineage B, restricted mainly to Argentina. Analysis of population structure inferred three genetic clusters along the distribution of O. gliroides that mostly agree with the four major barriers inferred by BARRIER analysis (e.g. rivers, salt flats, deserts, and mountain systems). In addition to the significant differentiation found among all levels studied, a positive correlation was identified between genetic and geographic distance, similar to as expected under the isolation-by-distance model. The most recent common ancestor of O. gliroides was estimated as c. 5.99 Mya, and the divergence between lineages A and B is estimated to have occurred by the Middle Pleistocene, about 0.69 Mya. The mismatch distributions and neutrality tests suggested a signal of population range expansion for both lineages coincident with major climatic changes that occurred during the wet–dry events of the Pleistocene in the Andean Puna region. Bayesian skyline plots (BSPs) for lineage A suggest a long history of constant population size followed by a period of slight to moderate demographic expansion at c. 0.04 Mya, whereas lineage B remained unclear after BSP analysis, probably because of the limited sample size. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London","<b>Climate change and the distribution and conservation of the world's highest elevation woodlands in the South American Altiplano<\/b><br><br>Climate change is becoming an increasing threat to biodiversity.

These woodlands are dominated by Polylepis tarapacana (Rosaceae), a species that forms unique biological communities with important conservation value.

Since it is predicted that P. tarapacana's potential distribution will be severely reduced in the future, we propose a new network of national protected areas across this species distribution range in order to insure the future conservation of this unique ecosystem. Based on an extensive literature review we identify research topics and recommendations for on-ground conservation and management of P. tarapacana woodlands. © 2015.","<b>Continental-scale analysis reveals deep diversification within the polytypic Red-crowned Ant Tanager (Habia rubica, Cardinalidae)<\/b><br><br>We explored the phylogeographic patterns of intraspecific diversity in the Red-crowned Ant Tanager (Habia rubica) throughout its continent-wide distribution, in order to understand its evolutionary history and the role of evolutionary drivers that are considered to promote avian diversification in the Neotropics. We sampled 100 individuals of H. rubica from Mexico to Argentina covering the main areas of its disjunct distribution. We inferred phylogenetic relationships through Bayesian and maximum parsimony methodologies based on mitochondrial and nuclear markers, and complemented genetic analyses with the assessment of coloration and behavioral differentiation. We found four deeply divergent phylogroups within H. rubica: two South American lineages and two Mexican and Middle American lineages. The divergence event between the northern and southern phylogroups was dated to c. 5.0. Ma, seemingly related to the final uplift of the Northern Andes. Subsequently, the two South American phylogroups split c. 3.5. Ma possibly due to the development of the open vegetation corridor that currently isolates the Amazonian and Atlantic forests. Diversification throughout Mexico and Middle America, following dispersion across the Isthmus of Panama, was presumably more recent and coincident with Pleistocene climatic fluctuations and habitat fragmentations. The analyses of vocalizations and plumage coloration showed significant differences among main lineages that were consistent with the phylogenetic evidence. Our findings suggest that the evolutionary history of H. rubica has been shaped by an assortment of diversification drivers at different temporal and spatial scales resulting in deeply divergent lineages that we recommend should be treated as different species. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Nicaragua: Threshold inflation, economic growth and new monetary policy after the international crisis<\/b><br><br>After the international crisis, it was suggested that inflation targets should be raised in order to allow more space to monetary policies during contractionary product times.

New evidence to refine current surveillance guidelines has been provided by evaluating (1) the diagnostic performance of CI and serological tests for detection of FMD virus (FMDV) non-structural proteins (NSP), and (2) the within-herd transmission of the virus in partially immune cattle. Data came from 23 affected herds during an epidemic of FMDV type O in Bolivia, in 2007. All cattle (n= 957) in these herds were clinically inspected and serum samples were collected one month after the last animal with clinical signs was detected. Samples were tested for the presence of antibodies against NSP using the PANAFTOSA 3ABC-ELISA test and a subset of samples were tested using the enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot assay (EITB). Data from clinical and serological diagnoses were analysed using a Bayesian model. The sensitivity Se and specificity Sp of the tests, as well as the prevalence and the within-herd reproduction ratio R of FMDV were estimated. In addition, risk factors for infection were identified. The Se of CI, the 3ABC-ELISA and the EITB tests were estimated to be 0.30, 0.88 and 0.96 respectively. The estimated Sp, in the same order, were 0.88, 0.93 and 0.97. The within-herd prevalence of infected animals ranged from 0.04 to 0.91 and R ranged from 1.02 to 2.68. It was observed that cattle coming from areas with high vaccination coverage had a lower risk of becoming infected than home-bred cattle from the affected herds, where vaccination coverage was thought to be low. Although these estimates come from herds kept under specific conditions, they provide a reference for future surveillance design and can inform simulation models for surveillance and control of FMD in similar cattle populations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","<b>Genetic structure in the Amazonian catfish Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii: Influence of life history strategies<\/b><br><br>The Dorado or Plateado (Gilded catfish) Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii (Pimelodidae, Siluriformes) is a commercially valuable migratory catfish performing the largest migration in freshwaters: from the Amazonian headwaters in the Andean foothills (breeding area) to the Amazon estuary (nursery area). In spite of its importance to inform management and conservation efforts, the genetic variability of this species has only recently begun to be studied. The aim of the present work was to determine the population genetic structure of B. rousseauxii in two regions: the Upper Madera Basin (five locations in the Bolivian Amazon) and the Western Amazon Basin (one regional sample from the Uyucalí-Napo-Marañon-Amazon basin, Peru). Length polymorphism at nine microsatellite loci (284 individuals) was used to determine genetic variability and to identify the most probable panmictic units (using a Bayesian approach), after a significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed in the overall dataset (Western Amazon + Upper Madera). Bayesian analyses revealed at least three clusters in admixture in the five locations sampled in the Bolivian Amazon, whereas only two of these clusters were observed in the Western Amazon. Considering the migratory behaviour of B. rousseauxii, different life history strategies, including homing, are proposed to explain the cluster distribution. Our results are discussed in the light of the numerous threats to the species survival in the Madera basin, in particular dam and reservoir construction. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","<b>Endemic wild potato (Solanum spp.) biodiversity status in Bolivia: Reasons for conservation concerns<\/b><br><br>Crop wild relatives possess important traits, therefore ex situ and in situ conservation efforts are essential to maintain sufficient options for crop improvement. Bolivia is a centre of wild relative diversity for several crops, among them potato, which is an important staple worldwide and the principal food crop in this country. Despite their relevance for plant breeding, limited knowledge exists about their in situ conservation status. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and distribution modelling with the software Maxent to better understand geographic patterns of endemic wild potato diversity in Bolivia. In combination with threat layers, we assessed the conservation status of all endemic species, 21 in total. We prioritised areas for in situ conservation by using complementary reserve selection and excluded 25% of the most-threatened collection sites because costs to implement conservation measures at those locations may be too high compared to other areas. Some 70% (15 of 21 species) has a preliminary vulnerable status or worse according to IUCN red list distribution criteria. Our results show that four of these species would require special conservation attention because they were only observed in <15 locations and are highly threatened by human accessibility, fires and livestock pressure. Although highest species richness occurs in south-central Bolivia, in the departments Santa Cruz and Chuquisaca, the first priority area for in situ conservation according to our reserve selection exercise is central Bolivia, Cochabamba; this area is less threatened than the potato wild relatives' hotspot in south-central Bolivia. Only seven of the 21 species were observed in protected areas. To improve coverage of potato wild relatives' distribution by protected areas, we recommend starting inventories in parks and reserves with high modelled diversity. Finally, to improve ex situ conservation, we targeted areas for germplasm collection of species with <5 accessions conserved in genebanks. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.","<b>Molecular identification of a cryptic species in the Amazonian predatory catfish genus Pseudoplatystoma (Bleeker, 1962) from Peru<\/b><br><br>Pseudoplatystoma species are highly prized South American Pimelodid migratory catfishes. Until recently, their taxonomy was not clearly established, with discrepancies between morphological and molecular analyses. Here, Pseudoplatystoma species from the Peruvian Amazon were characterized at the molecular level from a sample representing the observed range of their color pattern variations in the study area. Analyses were performed using seven microsatellite loci for 103 specimens and, for part of them (52), using sequences of two regions of their mitochondrial genome [Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI) and Control Region (CR)]. Factorial correspondence analysis and assignment tests based on microsatellite polymorphism showed that the specimens originally identified as P. punctifer belonged to two different gene pools highly differentiated from P. tigrinum. Morphological examination identified two different morphotypes (with and without black stripes), suggesting the existence of two distinct taxa within P. punctifer. This result was corroborated by the ML tree based on CR sequences, where all individuals but four clustered in a similar way as in the FCA and Bayesian assignment tests. For these four individuals, mitochondrial introgression or retention of ancestral polymorphism was likely. In contrast, the ML tree based on COI sequences showed that reciprocal monophyly was not yet achieved for this marker for the two P. punctifer taxa. The existence of three sympatric species of Pseudoplatystoma in the Peruvian Amazon is discussed in relation to their molecular characteristics, color patterns and ecology. Evolutionary scenarios regarding their divergence are hypothesized. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","<b>Comparison of density estimation methods for mammal populations with camera traps in the Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco landscape<\/b><br><br>Sampling animal populations with camera traps has become increasingly popular over the past two decades, particularly for species that are cryptic, elusive, exist at low densities or range over large areas. The results have been widely used to estimate population size and density. We analyzed data from 13 camera trap surveys conducted at five sites across the Kaa-Iya landscape, Bolivian Chaco, for jaguar, puma, ocelot and lowland tapir. We compared two spatially explicit capture-recapture (SCR) software packages: secr, a likelihood-based approach, and SPACECAP, a Bayesian approach, both of which are implemented within the R environment and can be used to estimate animal density from photographic records of individual animals that simultaneously employ spatial information about the capture location relative to the sample location. As a non-spatial analysis, we used the program CAPTURE 2 to estimate abundance from the capture-recapture records of individuals identified through camera trap photos combined with an ad hoc estimation of the effective survey area to estimate density. SCR methods estimated jaguar population densities from 0.31 to 1.82 individuals per 100km 2 across the Kaa-Iya sites; puma from 0.36 to 7.99; ocelot from 1.67 to 51.7; and tapir from 7.38 to 42.9. Density estimates using either secr or SPACECAP were generally lower than the estimates generated using the non-spatial method for all surveys and species; and density estimates using SPACECAP were generally lower than that using secr. We recommend using either secr or SPACECAP because the spatially explicit methods are not biased by an informal estimation of an effective survey area. Although SPACECAP and secr are less sensitive than non-spatial methods to the size of the grid used for sampling, we recommend grid sizes several times larger than the average home range (known or estimated) of the target species. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.","<b>Towards a species level tree of the globally diverse genus Chenopodium (Chenopodiaceae)<\/b><br><br>Chenopodium is a large and morphologically variable genus of annual and perennial herbs with an almost global distribution. All subgenera and most sections of Chenopodium were sampled along with other genera of Chenopodieae, Atripliceae and Axyrideae across the subfamily Chenopodioideae (Chenopodiaceae), totalling to 140 taxa. Using Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of the non-coding trnL-F (cpDNA) and nuclear ITS regions, we provide a comprehensive picture of relationships of Chenopodium sensu lato. The genus as broadly classified is highly paraphyletic within Chenopodioideae, consisting of five major clades. Compared to previous studies, the tribe Dysphanieae with three genera Dysphania, Teloxys and Suckleya (comprising the aromatic species of Chenopodium s.l.) is now shown to form one of the early branches in the tree of Chenopodioideae. We further recognize the tribe Spinacieae to include Spinacia, several species of Chenopodium, and the genera Monolepis and Scleroblitum. The Chenopodium rubrum and the Ch. murale-clades were newly discovered as distinct major lineages but their relationships within Chenopodioideae will need further evaluation. Based on our results, we suggest the delimitation of Chenopodium to include Einadia and Rhagodia because these are part of the crown group composed of species of subg. Chenopodium that appear sister to the Atripliceae. The tetraploid crops such as Ch. berlandieri subsp. nuttalliae and Ch. quinoa also belong to Chenopodium sensu stricto. Trees derived from trnL-F and ITS were incongruent within this shallow crown group clade. Possible biological causes are discussed, including allopolyploidization. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Biogeographic implications of the striking discovery of a 4,000 kilometer disjunct population of the wild potato Solanum morelliforme in South America<\/b><br><br>Solanum morelliforme is an epiphytic wild potato (Solanum section Petota) species widely distributed throughout central Mexico to Honduras. A strikingly disjunct (approximately 4,000 km) population was recently discovered in Bolivia, representing the first record of this species in South America, and the first species in the section growing in both North and Central America and in South America. Our maximum entropy analysis of 19 climatic variables matches the occurrence of the South American locality with great precision. It demonstrates the strong predictive quality of this procedure and suggests similar localities where this species may be found, especially along the eastern slopes of the Andes in the Yungas region of southern Peru and Bolivia. In addition, the presence of S. morelliforme in South America adds to emerging data from yet other sources to question long-held hypotheses of the origin of section Petota in North and Central America. © Copyright 2011 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.","<b>Characterizing and propagating modeling uncertainties in photometrically derived redshift distributions<\/b><br><br>The uncertainty in the redshift distributions of galaxies has a significant potential impact on the cosmological parameter values inferred from multi-band imaging surveys. The accuracy of the photometric redshifts measured in these surveys depends not only on the quality of the flux data, but also on a number of modeling assumptions that enter into both the training set and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting methods of photometric redshift estimation. In this work we focus on the latter, considering two types of modeling uncertainties: uncertainties in the SED template set and uncertainties in the magnitude and type priors used in a Bayesian photometric redshift estimation method. We find that SED template selection effects dominate over magnitude prior errors. We introduce a method for parameterizing the resulting ignorance of the redshift distributions, and for propagating these uncertainties to uncertainties in cosmological parameters. © 2011.

Because they are affected by various threats such as habitat destruction, chytrid fungus, climate change,invasive species and human use, different approaches are needed for their conservation. In this paper we examine patterns of alpha diversity, endemism and threatened species distributions of amphibians in Bolivia. We modeled distribution data using ecological niche modeling implemented with MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy Modeling). In contrast with previous studies, we validated each individual map with specialists. Important areas for amphibian conservation were defined by overlapping species richness, endemism richness and concentration of threatened species, and then excluding all unsuitable habitats. Our goal was to identify high-priority sites for the conservation of amphibians in Bolivia. We discuss a place-based strategy (identification of priority areas) and the need for further non place-based strategies. We highlight the importance of strengthening two existing protected areas that together host up to 40% of Bolivia's threatened amphibian species, and we propose alternative strategies such as ex situ conservation for those species not covered by the priority areas. Bolivia's General Directorate for Biodiversity and Protected Areas (in Spanish, Dirección General de Biodiversidad y Áreas Protegidas (DGBAP)) and Bolivian experts are jointly using the here presented results to define a national strategy of amphibian conservation for safeguarding this important element of Bolivia's biodiversity. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V.2001.","<b>Spatial patterns of biological diversity in a neotropical lowland savanna of northeastern Bolivia<\/b><br><br>Understanding large-scale patterns of beta- and alpha diversity is essential for ecoregional conservation planning. Using the 110,000 km2 shallow basin of the Beni savannas of northeastern Bolivia, we examined the spatial patterns of biological diversity of four taxonomic groups (bats, palms, reptiles, and amphibians). Since the Beni savannas are shaped by cycles of drought and flood, and farming, which, together with topography, create a mosaic of sub-ecoregions from Amazonian forests to aquatic vegetation, we hypothesize that this landscape heterogeneity results in a high turnover in species composition across sub-ecoregions. We compiled species lists for each taxon and modeled the potential distribution of each species using the algorithm MaxEnt. For those species whose modeled potential distribution produced incongruous results, we built presence-absence maps. Using the potential distribution maps, we estimated the lists of species for each sub-ecoregion. In order to establish present similarities in species composition between sub-ecoregions, we constructed dendrograms using cluster analysis of presence-absence matrices. The sub-ecoregions associated with the Moxos (southern part of the Beni savannas) were richer than the sub-ecoregions composing the Beni Cerrado (northern part of the Beni savannas). Centers of species richness were detected in the savanna-type sub-ecoregions (bats and reptiles) or associated with the Várzea forests (palms and amphibians). A south-north gradient in the pattern of distribution of four taxonomic groups was also recorded. The results suggest that the patterns of biological diversity partially respond to the mosaic arrangement of the landscape. Future exercises on conservation planning will point to total target areas about 5,000 km2. This area seems to be sufficient to contain the biological richness of the region at least for the taxa analyzed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","<b>Are rapids a barrier for floodplain fishes of the Amazon basin?

Although genetically differentiated, IMa analyses suggest non-zero bi-directional migration rates, and inter-basin divergence of approximately 17 thousand years ago. Analyses in BEAST indicated that Bolivian C. macropomum has been demographically stable except for a moderate population increase in the last 12 thousand years, while Amazonian C. macropomum has been experiencing demographic growth over the last 350 thousand years, resulting in approximately one order of magnitude increase in coalescent Ne. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","<b>Impact of the quality of climate models for modelling species occurrences in countries with poor climatic documentation: a case study from Bolivia<\/b><br><br>The quality of climate models has largely been overlooked as a possible source of uncertainty that may affect the outcomes of species distribution models, especially in the tropics, where comparatively few climatic stations are available. We compared the geographical discrepancies and potential conservation implications of using two different climate models (Saga and Worldclim) in combination with the species modelling approach Maxent in Bolivia. We estimated ranges of selected bird and fern species biogeographically restricted to either humid montane forest of the northern Bolivian Andes or seasonal dry tropical forests (in the Andes and southern lowlands). Saga and Worldclim predicted roughly similar climate patterns of temperature that were significantly correlated. Precipitation layers of both climate models were also roughly similar, but showed important differences. Species ranges estimated with Worldclim and Saga likewise produced different results. Ranges of species endemic to humid montane forests estimated with Saga had higher AUC (Area under the curve) values than those estimated with Worldclim, which for example predicted the occurrence of humid montane forest bird species near Lake Titicaca, an area that is clearly unsuitable for these species. Likewise, Worldclim overpredicted the occurrence of fern and bird species in the lowlands of the Chapare region and well south of the Andean Elbow, where more seasonal biomes occur. By contrast, Saga predictions were coherent with the known distribution of humid montane forests in the northern Bolivian Andes. Estimated ranges of species endemic to seasonal dry tropical forests predicted with Saga and Worldclim were not statistically different in most cases. However, detailed comparisons revealed that Saga was able to distinguish fragments of seasonal dry tropical forests in rain-shadow valleys of the northern Bolivian Andes, whereas Worldclim was not. These differences highlight the neglected influence of climate layers on modelling results and the importance of using the most accurate climate data available when modelling species distributions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

(Bromeliaceae) are terrestrial herbs with a centre of diversity in the central South American Andes. To resolve infra- and intergeneric relationships among Fosterella and their putative allies, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis based on sequence data from four chloroplast DNA regions (matK gene, rps16 intron, atpB-rbcL and psbB-psbH intergenic spacers). Sequences were generated for 96 accessions corresponding to 60 species from 18 genera. Among these, 57 accessions represented 22 of the 31 recognized Fosterella species and one undescribed morphospecies. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods yielded well-resolved phylogenies. The monophyly of Fosterella was strongly supported, as was its sister relationship with a clade comprising Deuterocohnia, Dyckia and Encholirium. Six distinct evolutionary lineages were distinguished within Fosterella. Character mapping indicated that parallel evolution of identical character states is common in the genus. Relationships between species and lineages are discussed in the context of morphological, ecological and biogeographical data as well as the results of a previous amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) study. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of the present study was to assess antibody seroprevalences against rabies in dogs vaccinated under field conditions and other factors that might influence the success of the on-going rabies control programmes in an endemic area of the disease, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia. All 240 study animals, selected using area-stratified random sampling, were investigated in April 2007. Test prevalences were adjusted for the imperfect test characteristics using the Rogan-Gladen estimator (deterministic and stochastic functions) and Bayesian inference. Ninety-four of the tested 240 vaccinated dogs were classified as test-positive for rabies-specific antibodies. With regard to adjusted overall antibody seroprevalence, Bayesian true prevalence estimates (41%, 95% CI: 37-46%) were lower than both of the Rogan-Gladen estimates. The effect of various epidemiological factors on post-vaccination response was also assessed. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","<b>Predicting species distributions in poorly-studied landscapes<\/b><br><br>Conservationists are increasingly relying on distribution models to predict where species are likely to occur, especially in poorly-surveyed but biodiverse areas. Modeling is challenging in these cases because locality data necessary for model formation are often scarce and spatially imprecise. To identify methods best suited to modeling in these conditions, we compared the success of three algorithms (Maxent, Mahalanobis Typicalities and Random Forests) at predicting distributions of eight bird and eight mammal species endemic to the eastern slopes of the central Andes. We selected study species to have a range of locality sample sizes representative of the data available for endemic species of this region and also that vary in their distribution characteristics. We found that for species that are known from moderate numbers (N = 38-94) of localities, the three methods performed similarly for species with restricted distributions but Maxent and Random Forests yielded better results for species with wider distributions. For species with small numbers of sample localities (N = 5-21), Maxent produced the most consistently successful results, followed by Random Forests and then Mahalanobis Typicalities. Because evaluation statistics for models derived from few localities can be suspect due to the poor spatial representation of the evaluation data, we corroborated these results with review by scientists familiar with the species in the field. Overall, Maxent appears to be the most capable method for modeling distributions of Andean bird and mammal species because of the consistency of results in varying conditions, although the other methods have strengths in certain situations. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","<b>The history of Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests in eastern South America: Inferences from the genetic structure of the tree Astronium urundeuva (Anacardiaceae)<\/b><br><br>Today, the Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTF) of eastern South America occur as large, well-defined nuclei (e.g. Caatinga in the northeast) and as smaller enclaves within other vegetations (e.g. Cerrado and Chaco). In order to infer the way the present SDTF distribution was attained, the genetic structure of Astronium urundeuva, a tree confined to SDTF, was assessed using two chloroplast spacers and nine microsatellite loci. Five haplotypes were identified, whose distribution was spatially structured. The distribution of the two most common and divergent haplotypes suggested former vicariance and progressive divergence due to isolation. More recent range expansions of these two lineages subsequently occurred, leading to a secondary contact at the southern limit of the Caatinga SDTF nucleus. The multilocus-Bayesian approach using microsatellites consistently identified three groups of populations (Northeast, Central and Southwest). Isolation by distance was found in Northeast and Southwest groups whereas admixture was detected in the Central group, located at the transition between Caatinga and Cerrado domains. All together, the results support the existence of range expansions and secondary contact in the Central group. This study provides arguments that favour the existence of a previously more continuous formation of SDTF in eastern South America. © 2008 The Authors.","<b>A statistical method for litho-facies identification<\/b><br><br>In this paper a procedure for the estimation of the lithological description of the stratigraphical formation by wells is described; in this procedure the results of wireline measurements and a litho-facies database are combined. The litho-facies are defined from log values and histograms and are translated into gaussian distributions. In order to optimise type lithologies we have used the discriminant function referred to as the Bayes rule. In addition, several logic rules have been applied in order to discriminate between different litho-facies (test of shale volume and bore hole conditions). The wireline logs used are density, sonic transit time, gamma ray, spontaneous potential and resistivity. The litho-facies groups represented in this database are sandstone, calcareous sand, shaly sand and shale. The procedure has been applied to two wells in a fluvial environment (sand-shales series). The results have been compared with drilling rates, cutting descriptions and Dipmeter information. For each level a lithological column can be produced with a computed probability.

Biodiversity modelling is a key tool for the integration of these drivers and the predictions generated are essential, for example, for climate change forecast and conservation planning. However, the reliability of biodiversity models at the local scale remains poorly understood, especially in tropical species-rich areas, where they are required. We inventoried all woody plants with stems ≥ 2.5 cm in 397 plots across the Andes-Amazon gradient. We generated and mapped 19 uncorrelated biodiversity drivers at 90 m resolution, grouped into four categories: microclimatic, microtopographic, anthropic, and edaphic. In order to evaluate the importance of the different categories, we grouped biodiversity drivers into four different clusters by categories. For each of the four clusters of biodiversity drivers, we modelled the observed species richness using two statistical techniques (random forest and Bayesian inference) and two modelling procedures (including or excluding a spatial component). All the biodiversity models produced were evaluated by cross-validation. Species richness was accurately predicted by random forest (Spearman correlation up to 0.85 and explained variance up to 67%). The results suggest that precipitation and temperature are important driving forces of species richness in the region. Nonetheless, a spatial component should be considered to properly predict biodiversity. This could reflect macroevolutionary underlying forces not considered here, such as colonization time, dispersal capacities, or speciation rates. However, the proposed biodiversity modelling approach can predict accurately species richness at the local scale and detailed resolution (90 m) in tropical areas, something that previous works had found extremely challenging. The innovative methodology presented here could be employed in other areas with conservation needs. © 2022","Telmatobius is the most diverse group of anurans in the Andean Altiplano (highlands) Morphologically, these amphibians have a generally conserved morphology but in turn present large intraspecific variation, which has led to a complex taxonomy and systematics. T. marmoratus has the widest distribution of the genus and forms a complex composed of at least two Telmatobius species. Partial systematic studies based on molecular evidence reveal the existence of three lineages with a complex spatial distribution. However, these studies did not include the entire distribution of T. marmoratus. Our study aims to reassess the current systematic scenario including the complete distribution of the complex. For this, we used a multilocus approach based on mitochondrial (16S, Cytb) and nuclear (RAG1-1, BFIB) DNA sequences to build a phylogenetic hypothesis based on Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony. Subsequently, we performed single-locus (ABGD and PTP) and multilocus (STACEY) species delimitation analyses to verify the diversity of nominal species within the complex. The analyses suggest seven non-sibling lineages and 6–10 candidate species within the marmoratus complex. Only one of the two lineages restricted to the central northern plateau correspond to T. marmoratus sensu stricto. South-central marbled water frogs belong to completely new lineages closer to T. gigas and T. culeus, evidencing the polyphyletic condition of the marmoratus complex. The findings of several sympatric lineages in some localities reveal a complex history of ancient water connections in south-central Altiplano. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","The escape behaviour, measured as flight initiation distance (FID; the distance at which individuals take flight when approached by a potential predator, usually a human in the study systems), is a measure widely used to study fearfulness and risk-taking in animals. Previous studies have shown significant differences in the escape behaviour of birds inhabiting cemeteries and urban parks in European cities, where birds seem to be shyer in the latter. We collected a regional dataset of the FID of birds inhabiting cemeteries and parks across Latin America in peri-urban, suburban and urban parks and cemeteries. FIDs were recorded for eighty-one bird species. Mean species-specific FIDs ranged from 1.9 to 19.7 m for species with at least two observations (fifty-seven species). Using Bayesian regression modelling and controlling for the phylogenetic relatedness of the FID among bird species and city and country, we found that, in contrast to a recent publication from Europe, birds escape earlier in cemeteries than parks in the studied Latin American cities. FIDs were also significantly shorter in urban areas than in peri-urban areas and in areas with higher human density. Our results indicate that some idiosyncratic patterns in animal fearfulness towards humans may emerge among different geographic regions, highlighting difficulties with scaling up and application of regional findings to other ecosystems and world regions. Such differences could be associated with intrinsic differences between the pool of bird species from temperate European and mostly tropical Latin American cities, characterized by different evolutionary histories, but also with differences in the historical process of urbanization. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Forecasting the effects of climate change on the distribution of Andean trees (Polylepis, Rosaceae) is important to understand how species respond to climate variability and to assess their resilience to the ongoing climate crisis. Here, paleodistribution modelling is used to assess distribution shifts of 17 Polylepis species during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), mid-Holocene (MH), and the Anthropocene in the central Andes. Species distribution models (SDMs) were computed by combining presence records and current climatic conditions using Maxent and projected onto three climatic scenarios for the LGM (~22,000 yr BP), the MH (~6,000 yr BP), and the Anthropocene (1,970–2,000). Subsequently, current refugia hotspots were identified by intersecting suitable habitat over the LGM, MH, and anthropogenic conditions for all the studied species. SDMs for the LGM and MH showed a contraction of climate suitable habitat for most of the species in comparison to the Anthropocene. Four current refugia hotspots were identified: central Cordillera of Peru, Lake Titicaca basin, western Cordillera of Bolivia, and northern Chile. In general, SDMs were consistent with patterns proposed with pollen records, and partially with available phylogeographic studies. Current hotspots are highly important areas for the conservation of Polylepis and associated biota. This study assists in understanding distribution shifts over millennia of Andean tree species in response to climate change and identifying key conservation areas for the delineation of future conservation strategies. © 2021 The Author(s).

Ceratozygum horridum (Germar, 1839) is a little-known species with scarce occurrence data but presenting a broad and discontinuous distribution in Amazon and Atlantic Forest, lacking records in the dry diagonal. Field trips in Bolivia registered new records of C. horridum in an ecotone between the Southwest Amazon forest, the Chiquitano Dry Forest and the Dry Chaco forest. We used the maximum entropy algorithm aiming to model the occurrence probability of C. horridum on the Amazon Forest and transferred this model to the dry diagonal and the Atlantic Forest looking for continuous areas of probable occurrence for this species. We used ten records for a constrained portion of the Amazon forests and four environmental layers to train models with different numbers of background points. The average model performances returned AUC values higher than 0.7 and maximum sensitivity was reached. The models could not predict species occurrence with reliability when transferred to the whole Amazon area, dry diagonal, and the Atlantic Forests. Our findings suggest a low probability of occurrence of C. horridum in the dry diagonal, supporting the hypothesis that the Amazon and Atlantic Forests populations are isolated by the dry diagonal. The populations of C. horridum seem to be isolated in small spots with dissimilar ecological features across the complex ecoregions of the Neotropics. Building species distribution models for species with poorly known distribution is challenging and may raise more questions than light answers. Even the small pieces of evidence are pertinent to the knowledge of rare species like C. horridum. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:author:E11F3EE3-C93F-40EB-AC68-AD1B7C954E5E. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","The Purpose of this paper is to quantify the impacts on social welfare and risk premium, by combination and alternatives to interactions of economic policy: fiscal-monetary, fiscal-exchange and monetary for the Bolivian case. There are also considered unidirectional economic policies with counterfactual analysis without interaction. The estimates are presented by a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model with the incorporation of Bayesian structural autoregressive vectors (SVAR). The findings suggest that the fiscal-monetary interaction generates 79% of variability in social welfare, while the unidirectional exchange rate policy is a relevant factor for Risk premium of more than 84%. In the absence of economic policy interaction, productivity shocks are the most relevant. © 2021, Economic Laboratory for Transition Research.

Randomized control trials (RCTs) provide particularly robust evidence of the effectiveness of interventions (although they have been criticized as reductionist and unable to provide insights into mechanisms), but there have been few such experiments investigating conservation at the landscape scale. We explored the impact of Watershared, an incentive-based conservation program in the Bolivian Andes, with one of the few RCTs of landscape-scale conservation in existence. There is strong interest in such incentive-based conservation approaches as some argue they can avoid negative social impacts sometimes associated with protected areas. We focused on social and environmental outcomes based on responses from a household survey in 129 communities randomly allocated to control or treatment (conducted both at the baseline in 2010 and repeated in 2015–2016). We controlled for incomplete program uptake by combining standard RCT analysis with matching methods and investigated mechanisms by exploring intermediate and ultimate outcomes according to the underlying theory of change. Previous analyses, focused on single biophysical outcomes, showed that over its first 5 years Watershared did not slow deforestation or improve water quality at the landscape scale. We found that Watershared influenced some outcomes measured using the survey, but the effects were complex, and some were unexpected. We thus demonstrated how RCTs can provide insights into the pathways of impact, as well as whether an intervention has impact. This paper, one of the first registered reports in conservation science, demonstrates how preregistration can help make complex research designs more transparent, avoid cherry picking, and reduce publication bias. © 2020 Society for Conservation Biology","The central Andean rainforests and the Atlantic Forest are two similar biomes that are fully isolated by xerophytic and open-vegetation regions (the Chaco and Cerrado, respectively). Even though there is evidence suggesting that these rainforests have been connected in the past, their dynamics of connection, the geographic areas that bridged these regions, and the biological processes that have promoted diversification between them remain to be studied. In this research, we used three passerine species (Poecilotriccus plumbeiceps, Phylloscartes ventralis and Cacicus chrysopterus) as models to address whether the Andean and the Atlantic forests have acted as a refugia system (macrorefugia), and to evaluate biogeographic hypotheses of diversification and connection between them. In order to achieve these goals, we performed traditional phylogeographic analyses and compared alternative biogeographic scenarios by using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Additionally, we performed morphological analyses to evaluate phenotypic divergence between these regions. Our findings support that both rainforest regions acted as refugia, but that the impact of their isolation was stronger on the genetic than on the morphologic characters. Our results provided evidence that both geographic isolation as well as ecological factors have modeled the external traits of forest organisms in the region. Regarding the connection routes between the Andes and the Atlantic Forest, the genetic data rejected the hypothesis of a Chaco connection in the tested species, providing evidence for a connection through the Cerrado or through the transition between the Cerrado and Chaco, in a process that could have started as early as the Late Miocene. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Microfinance targets women and uses loan provision as a tool for empowerment, which translates into better household nutrition, improved education, and a scale down of domestic violence. However, ethnic discrimination in microfinance may exist in countries with a segregated indigenous population. We assessed this possibility with a field experiment in Bolivia. The controlled laboratory experiment evaluated whether credit officers rejected microloan applications based on the interaction effect of ethnicity and gender of potential borrowers. Point estimates of a Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression, estimated with the experimental data, indicate that nonindigenous women have double the chance of loan approval, but indigenous women have only 1.5 times the chance of loan approval when compared with men. While the findings about gender are limited, the evidence for the interaction of gender and ethnicity is more robust and suggests the existence of positive taste-based discrimination favorable for nonethnic women in Bolivia. We conclude that the affirmative actions towards women promoted by development agencies and microfinance institutions must not overlook ethnicity as an important factor for financial policies of sustainable development. In practice, these policies should be aimed at identifying and reducing both social desirability bias and the structural barriers to financial inclusion that indigenous women may face when trying to obtain access to a loan. © 2019 The Authors. Review of Development Economics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Dipteryx timber has been heavily exploited in South America since 2000s due to the increasing international demand for hardwood. Developing tools for the genetic identification of Dipteryx species and their geographical origin can help to promote legal trading of timber. A collection of 800 individual trees, belonging to 6 different Dipteryx species, was genotyped based on 171 molecular markers. After the exclusion of markers out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or with no polymorphism or low amplification, 83 nuclear, 29 chloroplast, 13 mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and 2 chloroplast and 5 mitochondrial INDELS remained. Six genetic groups were identified using Bayesian Structure analyses of the nuclear SNPs, which corresponded to the different Dipteryx species collected in the field. Seventeen highly informative markers were identified as suitable for species identification and obtained self-assignment success rates to species level of 78-96%. An additional set of 15 molecular markers was selected to determine the different genetic clusters found in Dipteryx odorata and Dipteryx ferrea, obtaining self-assignment success rates of 91-100%. The success to assign samples to the correct country of origin using all or only the informative markers improved when using the nearest neighbor approach (69-92%) compared to the Bayesian approach (33-80%). While nuclear and chloroplast SNPs were more suitable for differentiating the different Dipteryx species, mitochondrial SNPs were ideal for determining the genetic clusters of D. odorata and D. ferrea. These 32 selected SNPs will be invaluable genetic tools for the accurate identification of species and country of origin of Dipteryx timber. © The American Genetic Association 2020.

Despite its great morphological diversity and complex taxonomic history, a robust phylogenetic estimate is still lacking for this group. Here, we study the morphological and molecular diversity of the L. montanus group and present the most complete quantitative phylogenetic hypothesis for the group to date. Our phylogeny includes 103 terminal taxa, of which 91 are members of the L. montanus group (58 are assigned to available species and 33 are of uncertain taxonomic status). Our matrix includes 306 morphological and ecological characters and 3057 molecular characters. Morphological characters include 48 continuous and 258 discrete characters, of which 70% (216) are new to the literature. The molecular characters represent five mitochondrial markers. We performed three analyses: A morphology-only matrix, a molecular-only matrix and a matrix including both morphological and molecular characters (total evidence hypothesis). Our total evidence hypothesis recovered the L. montanus group as monophyletic and included ≥ 12 major clades, revealing an unexpectedly complex phylogeny. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.","The genus Gomphrena comprises about 120 species in the Americas and 35 in Australia. Previous research revealed that Gossypianthus, Lithophila and Philoxerus are closely related but the monophyly of Gomphrena remained unresolved. Our aim was to clarify phylogenetic relationships in Gomphrena and allies based on a thorough sampling of species and to reconstruct the evolution of morphological characters including C4 photosynthesis, and to explore the disjunction of the Australian taxa. We generated datasets of plastid (matK-trnK, trnL-F, rpl16) and nrITS representing 45 taxa of Gomphrena plus relatives and analysed them with parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian methods. Ancestral states of phenotypic characters were reconstructed with BayesTraits. BEAST was employed for divergence time estimates using an extended Amaranthaceae - Chenopodiaceae dataset to place fossil calibration points. Gossypianthus is closely related to a Gomphrena radiata - G. umbellata - G. tomentosa clade and G. meyeniana, whereas Lithophila and Philoxerus appear as successive sisters of the Australian species of Gomphrena. The majority of Andean species appears in a large clade including annual and perennial species. The Cerrado species Gomphrena mollis and G. rupestris, which are C3, constitute an early-branching lineage, whereas the core Gomphrena clade is C4 and has the inner two sepals strongly compressed as synapomorphy. A major subclade evolved inflorescences with subglobose paracladia in a whorl, supported by pseudanthial leaves. Whereas the core Gomphrena clade started to diversify around 11.4 Ma (8.45 - 14.5 95 % highest posterior density [HPD]) the Australian lineage split at only 4.8 Ma (2.61 - 7.18 HPD). Our detailed phylogenetic analysis of Gomphrena depicts 10 major lineages including segregate genera. We hypothesize that an adaptation to costal habitats was followed by long-distance dispersal to Australia. We also propose a revised genus concept of Gomphrena including Gossypianthus, Lithophila and Philoxerus, considering that these small segregate genera were based on states of vegetative characters exhibiting adaptations to specific habitats rather than phylogeny and overall morphology. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Phylogenetic analyses of Ameerega are highly discordant, lacking consistency due to variation in data types and methods, and often with limited coverage of species diversity in the genus. Here, we present a comprehensive phylogenomic reconstruction of Ameerega, utilizing state-of-the-art sequence capture techniques and phylogenetic methods. We sequenced thousands of ultraconserved elements from over 100 tissue samples, representing almost every described Ameerega species, as well as undescribed cryptic diversity. We generated topologies using maximum likelihood and coalescent methods and compared the use of maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods for estimating divergence times. Our phylogenetic inference diverged strongly from those of previous studies, and we recommend steps to bring Ameerega taxonomy in line with the new phylogeny. We place several species in a phylogeny for the first time, as well as provide evidence for six potential candidate species. We estimate that Ameerega experienced a rapid radiation approximately 7–11 million years ago and that the ancestor of all Ameerega was likely an aposematic, montane species. This study underscores the utility of phylogenomic data in improving our understanding of the phylogeny of understudied clades and making novel inferences about their evolution. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Triatomines are the vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Although Triatoma and Rhodnius are the most-studied vector genera, other triatomines, such as Panstrongylus, also transmit T. cruzi, creating new epidemiological scenarios. Panstrongylus has at least 13 reported species but there is limited information about its intraspecific genetic variation and patterns of diversification. Here, we begin to fill this gap by studying populations of P. geniculatus from Colombia and Venezuela and including other epidemiologically important species from the region. We examined the pattern of diversification of P. geniculatus in Colombia using mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal data. Genetic diversity and differentiation were calculated within and among populations of P. geniculatus. Moreover, we constructed maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference phylogenies and haplotype networks using P. geniculatus and other species from the genus (P. megistus, P. lignarius, P. lutzi, P. tupynambai, P. chinai, P. rufotuberculatus and P. howardi). Using a coalescence framework, we also dated the P. geniculatus lineages. The total evidence tree showed that P. geniculatus is a monophyletic species, with four clades that are concordant with its geographic distribution and are partly explained by the Andes orogeny. However, other factors, including anthropogenic and eco-epidemiological effects must be investigated to explain the existence of recent geographic P. geniculatus lineages. The epidemiological dynamics in structured vector populations, such as those found here, warrant further investigation. Extending our knowledge of P. geniculatus is necessary for the accurate development of effective strategies for the control of Chagas disease vectors. © 2019 Caicedo-Garzón et al.","Illegal trade of tropical timber leads to biodiversity and economic losses worldwide. There is a need for forensic tools that allow tracing the origin of timber and verifying compliance with international and national regulations. We evaluated the potential for genetic tracing of Cedrela odorata, one of the most traded neotropical timbers, within Bolivia. Using a set of seven microsatellites (SSRs), we studied the spatial distribution and genetic diversity and tested whether populations show sufficient genetic discrimination for timber tracing at a national level. Cambium and leaves were sampled from 81 C. odorata trees from three sites, at 268–501-km distance. To explore genetic differentiation, Bayesian clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) were employed. To infer the origin of samples, we conducted kernel discriminant analysis (KDA) based on a PCA that included all alleles and a manual assessment of site-unique alleles. The PCA showed three distinct genetic clusters, but only one of them corresponded with one of the sampled sites. The KDA based on allele frequency had a 33.7% mean classification error, with a considerably lower error (8.2%) for the site which matched with one genetic cluster. The blind test on unique alleles led to a similar classification error (30%). The occurrence of multiple genetic clusters within sites suggests that Bolivian C. odorata populations contain several parental lines, resulting in limited potential for forensic tracing at a national level. Based on our findings, we recommend for additional sampling across the spatial range of C. odorata within the country to support the development of forensic techniques for this species. © 2019, The Author(s).","The taxonomy of the East Pacific land crab Johngarthia planata (Stimpson, 1860) is reviewed and a neotype designated to stabilize the taxonomy of this species. The population of J. planata is found to be restricted to inshore islands and the continental mainland coast of the tropical and subtropical Pacific coast of America. A new species, Johngarthia oceanica sp. nov., is described for populations that occur on the oceanic Clipperton and Socorro islands. Johngarthia oceanica sp. nov., can be separated from J. planata by the broad, subrectangular mesial lobe of the infraorbital margin (narrow, subtriangular in J. planata) and a dorsal carapace that is dark yellow to brightly orange with or without black areas of different extension (homogeneously red to maroon in J. planata). The distribution of J. planata is modeled using MaxEnt and the biogeography of East Pacific species of Johngarthia is discussed. The conservation status of the Clipperton population of J. oceanica sp. nov. deserves special attention because this population may be threatened by introduced rats. © 2019 by University of Hawai'i Press.

To achieve these goals we selected the Buff-browed Foliage-gleaner Syndactyla rufosuperciliata (Aves, Furnariidae) as a study system, a taxon distributed between the Andean and Atlantic forest. We first explored the historical connectivity between regions through niche modeling. We subsequently used DNA sequences (n = 71 individuals) and genomic analyses (ddRADseq, n = 33 individuals) to evaluate population genetic structure and gene flow within this species. Finally, we performed population model selection using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Our findings indicate that the Andean and the Atlantic forests acted as refugia, and that the populations of the focal species from both regions contacted through the Cerrado region, thus suggesting that the historical dynamics of Andean and Atlantic forests are important for the evolution of forest birds in the region. The results are in agreement with studies of other organisms and may indicate a more general pattern of connectivity among biomes in the Neotropics. Finally, we recommend recognizing both the Andean and the Altantic forests lineages of S. rufosuperciliata as independent species. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ancient lakes are renowned for their exceptional diversity of endemic species. As model systems for the study of sympatric speciation, it is necessary to understand whether a given hypothesized species flock is of monophyletic or polyphyletic origin. Here, we present the first molecular characterization of the Hyalella (Crustacea: Amphipoda) species complex of Lake Titicaca, using COI and 28S DNA sequences, including samples from the connected Small and Large Lakes that comprise Lake Titicaca as well as from a broader survey of southern South American sites. At least five evolutionarily distant lineages are present within Lake Titicaca, which were estimated to have diverged from one another 12–20 MYA. These major lineages are dispersed throughout the broader South American Hyalella phylogeny, with each lineage representing at least one independent colonization of the lake. Moreover, complex genetic relationships are revealed between Lake Titicaca individuals and those from surrounding water bodies, which may be explained by repeated dispersal into and out of the lake, combined with parallel intralacustrine diversification within two separate clades. Although further work in deeper waters will be required to determine the number of species present and modes of diversification, our results strongly indicate that this amphipod species cloud is polyphyletic with a complex geographic history. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Andean orogenesis has driven the development of very high plant diversity in theNeotropics through its impact on landscape evolution and climate. The analysis ofthe intraspecific patterns of genetic structure in plants would permit inferring theeffects of Andean uplift on the evolution and diversification of Neotropical flora. Inthis study, using microsatellite markers and Bayesian clustering analyses, we reportthe presence of four genetic clusters for the palm Oenocarpus bataua var. batauawhich are located within four biogeographic regions in northwestern South America:(a) Chocó rain forest, (b) Amotape-Huancabamba Zone, (c) northwestern Amazonianrain forest, and (d) southwestern Amazonian rain forest. We hypothesize that theseclusters developed following three genetic diversification events mainly promoted byAndean orogenic events. Additionally, the distinct current climate dynamics amongnorthwestern and southwestern Amazonia may maintain the genetic diversificationdetected in the western Amazon basin. Genetic exchange was identified betweenthe clusters, including across the Andes region, discarding the possibility of any cluster to diversify as a distinct intraspecific variety. We identified a hot spot of geneticdiversity in the northern Peruvian Amazon around the locality of Iquitos. We alsodetected a decrease in diversity with distance from this area in westward and southward direction within the Amazon basin and the eastern Andean foothills. Additionally,we confirmed the existence and divergence of O. bataua var. bataua from var. oligocarpus in northern South America, possibly expanding the distributional range of thelatter variety beyond eastern Venezuela, to the central and eastern Andean cordilleras of Colombia. Based on our results, we suggest that Andean orogenesis is themain driver of genetic structuring and diversification in O. bataua within northwestern South America. © 2018 The Authors.","Aim: Explaining species richness gradients in space and time requires understanding the evolutionary processes that ultimately alter the number of species. Here we examine species richness differences between primary habitats (forest versus open) for Furnariides birds, a Neotropical endemic bird clade, to test three major historical hypotheses – diversification rate, out of the tropics and tropical niche conservatism – and assess the role of evolutionary processes in driving the Furnariides species richness gradient. Location: Neotropics. Methods: We used phylogenetic and spatial data to tests the historical hypotheses. First, we used GeoSSE and Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixture models to evaluate differential diversification and dispersal rates between habitats. Second, we quantify the root distance of each species and examined the phylogenetic structure of the richness gradient and the correlation between total species richness and the richness of early-diverged and recently originated species. Results: Furnariides species richness is higher in forest than in open habitats. However, we found higher speciation, extinction, and dispersal rates in open when compared to forest habitats, resulting in a higher diversification rate in open habitats and higher dispersal rate out of open habitats than into them. The phylogenetic structure of the richness gradient showed strong spatial pattern, with early diverged species richness peaking in forest habitats and driving the overall Furnariides gradient. Main conclusions: The Furnariides species richness gradient results from the joint effect of differential rates of macroevolutionary processes. Our findings highlight dispersal and extinction as dominant forces driving richness differences between habitats, through the addition and extirpation of species from open to forest habitats. Differences in species richness between habitats support niche conservatism of forest habitat preferences of Furnariides species. We suggest that open habitats are effective evolutionary arenas and a key to the maintenance of bird diversity in forest habitats over evolutionary time. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","The Atlantic Forest is separated from the Andean tropical forest by dry and open vegetation biomes (Chaco and Cerrado). Despite this isolation, both rainforests share closely related lineages, which suggest a past connection. This connection could have been important for forest taxa evolution. In this study, we used the Saffron-billed Sparrow (Arremon flavirostris) as a model to evaluate whether the Andean and the Atlantic forests act as a refugia system, as well as to test for a history of biogeographic connection between them. In addition, we evaluated the molecular systematic of intraspecific lineages of the studied species. We modeled the current and past distribution of A. flavirostris, performed phylogeographic analyses based on mitochondrial and nuclear genes, and used Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) analyses to test for biogeographic scenarios. The major phylogeographic disjunction within A. flavirostris was found between the Andean and the Atlantic forests, with a divergence that occurred during the Mid-Pleistocene. Our paleodistribution models indicated a connection between these forest domains in different periods and through both the Chaco and Cerrado. Additionally, the phylogeographic and ABC analyses supported that the Cerrado was the main route of connection between these rainforests, but without giving decisive evidence against a Chaco connection. Our study with A. flavirostris suggest that the biodiversity of the Andean and of the Atlantic forests could have been impacted (and perhaps enriched?) by cycles of connections through the Cerrado and Chaco. This recurrent cycle of connection between the Andean and the Atlantic Forest could have been important for the evolution of Neotropical forest taxa. In addition, we discussed taxonomic implications of the results and proposed to split the studied taxon into two full species. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Understanding the distribution of crop genetic diversity in relation to environmental factors can give insights into the eco-evolutionary processes involved in plant domestication. Yam beans (Pachyrhizus Rich. ex DC.) are leguminous crops native to South and Central America that are grown for their tuberous roots but are seed-propagated. Using a landscape genetic approach, we examined correlations between environmental factors and phylogeographic patterns of genetic diversity in Pachyrhizus landrace populations. Molecular analyses based on chloroplast DNA sequencing and a new set of nuclear microsatellite markers revealed two distinct lineages, with strong genetic differentiation between Andean landraces (lineage A) and Amazonian landraces (lineage B). The comparison of different evolutionary scenarios for the diversification history of yam beans in the Andes using approximate Bayesian computation suggests that Pachyrhizus ahipa and Pachyrhizus tuberosus share a progenitor-derivative relationship, with environmental factors playing an important role in driving selection for divergent ecotypes. The new molecular data call for a revision of the taxonomy of Pachyrhizus but are congruent with paleoclimatic and archeological evidence, and suggest that selection for determinate growth was part of ecophysiological adaptations associated with the diversification of the P. tuberosus–P. ahipa complex during the Mid-Holocene. © 2017 The Authors.

I-O tables can be unbalanced if the sum of its columns (total input destination) does not equal the sum of its rows (total output). An artificial Ant Colony (ACO) algorithm based on Bayesian slave-making polymorphus ants is proposed for balancing an I-O matrix. The approach is inspired on the behavior of Rossomyrmex minuchae, a parasite ant that enslaves other species of ants (Proformica) which in turn choose an optimal path between their colony and the source of food by leaving a trace of pheromones. In the algorithm, an improvement in the balance of I-O accounts increase the pheromones, thus raising the probability of ants moving towards the equilibrium of the matrix. An application to a real I-O matrix and Monte Carlo experiments were performed to evaluate the proposed ACO algorithm. The results showed that slave-raiding ACO can be used by statistical offices as an automated algorithm to produce more timely and reliable I-O tables. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

In order to understand the phylogeographic patterns of Octodontomys gliroides, we sequenced 579 bp of the mitochondrial DNA control region from 100 individuals collected from 20 populations across its entire distributional range. The phylogenetic and parsimony network, in conjunction with analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), revealed a structured pattern of geographic differentiation of O. gliroides, with the occurrence of two well-defined evolutionary lineages: lineage A, restricted to Bolivia and Chile, and lineage B, restricted mainly to Argentina. Analysis of population structure inferred three genetic clusters along the distribution of O. gliroides that mostly agree with the four major barriers inferred by BARRIER analysis (e.g. rivers, salt flats, deserts, and mountain systems). In addition to the significant differentiation found among all levels studied, a positive correlation was identified between genetic and geographic distance, similar to as expected under the isolation-by-distance model. The most recent common ancestor of O. gliroides was estimated as c. 5.99 Mya, and the divergence between lineages A and B is estimated to have occurred by the Middle Pleistocene, about 0.69 Mya. The mismatch distributions and neutrality tests suggested a signal of population range expansion for both lineages coincident with major climatic changes that occurred during the wet–dry events of the Pleistocene in the Andean Puna region. Bayesian skyline plots (BSPs) for lineage A suggest a long history of constant population size followed by a period of slight to moderate demographic expansion at c. 0.04 Mya, whereas lineage B remained unclear after BSP analysis, probably because of the limited sample size. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London","Climate change is becoming an increasing threat to biodiversity. Consequently, methods for delineation, establishment and management of protected areas must consider the species' future distribution in response to future climate conditions. Biodiversity in high altitude semiarid regions may be particularly threatened by future climate change. In this study we assess the main environmental variables that best explain present day presence of the world's highest elevation woodlands in the South American Altiplano, and model how climate change may affect the future distribution of this unique ecosystem under different climate change scenarios. These woodlands are dominated by Polylepis tarapacana (Rosaceae), a species that forms unique biological communities with important conservation value. Our results indicate that five environmental variables are responsible for 91% and 90.3% of the present and future P. tarapacana distribution models respectively, and suggest that at the end of the 21st century, there will be a significant reduction (56%) in the potential habitat for this species due to more arid conditions. Since it is predicted that P. tarapacana's potential distribution will be severely reduced in the future, we propose a new network of national protected areas across this species distribution range in order to insure the future conservation of this unique ecosystem. Based on an extensive literature review we identify research topics and recommendations for on-ground conservation and management of P. tarapacana woodlands. © 2015.","We explored the phylogeographic patterns of intraspecific diversity in the Red-crowned Ant Tanager (Habia rubica) throughout its continent-wide distribution, in order to understand its evolutionary history and the role of evolutionary drivers that are considered to promote avian diversification in the Neotropics. We sampled 100 individuals of H. rubica from Mexico to Argentina covering the main areas of its disjunct distribution. We inferred phylogenetic relationships through Bayesian and maximum parsimony methodologies based on mitochondrial and nuclear markers, and complemented genetic analyses with the assessment of coloration and behavioral differentiation. We found four deeply divergent phylogroups within H. rubica: two South American lineages and two Mexican and Middle American lineages. The divergence event between the northern and southern phylogroups was dated to c. 5.0. Ma, seemingly related to the final uplift of the Northern Andes. Subsequently, the two South American phylogroups split c. 3.5. Ma possibly due to the development of the open vegetation corridor that currently isolates the Amazonian and Atlantic forests. Diversification throughout Mexico and Middle America, following dispersion across the Isthmus of Panama, was presumably more recent and coincident with Pleistocene climatic fluctuations and habitat fragmentations. The analyses of vocalizations and plumage coloration showed significant differences among main lineages that were consistent with the phylogenetic evidence. Our findings suggest that the evolutionary history of H. rubica has been shaped by an assortment of diversification drivers at different temporal and spatial scales resulting in deeply divergent lineages that we recommend should be treated as different species. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","After the international crisis, it was suggested that inflation targets should be raised in order to allow more space to monetary policies during contractionary product times. The present study proposes that the limit to raise the inflation target should be threshold inflation, defined as the rate above which price variability is detrimental to economic growth. Bayesian methods are proposed to estimate this threshold. Results suggest that over the threshold there is a negative and statistically significant relationship between inflation and variations in the product. © 2014 Banco de la República de Colombia.","The control of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in vaccinated populations relies upon surveillance activities such as clinical inspections (CI) and serological monitoring. New evidence to refine current surveillance guidelines has been provided by evaluating (1) the diagnostic performance of CI and serological tests for detection of FMD virus (FMDV) non-structural proteins (NSP), and (2) the within-herd transmission of the virus in partially immune cattle. Data came from 23 affected herds during an epidemic of FMDV type O in Bolivia, in 2007. All cattle (n= 957) in these herds were clinically inspected and serum samples were collected one month after the last animal with clinical signs was detected. Samples were tested for the presence of antibodies against NSP using the PANAFTOSA 3ABC-ELISA test and a subset of samples were tested using the enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot assay (EITB). Data from clinical and serological diagnoses were analysed using a Bayesian model. The sensitivity Se and specificity Sp of the tests, as well as the prevalence and the within-herd reproduction ratio R of FMDV were estimated. In addition, risk factors for infection were identified. The Se of CI, the 3ABC-ELISA and the EITB tests were estimated to be 0.30, 0.88 and 0.96 respectively. The estimated Sp, in the same order, were 0.88, 0.93 and 0.97. The within-herd prevalence of infected animals ranged from 0.04 to 0.91 and R ranged from 1.02 to 2.68. It was observed that cattle coming from areas with high vaccination coverage had a lower risk of becoming infected than home-bred cattle from the affected herds, where vaccination coverage was thought to be low. Although these estimates come from herds kept under specific conditions, they provide a reference for future surveillance design and can inform simulation models for surveillance and control of FMD in similar cattle populations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","The Dorado or Plateado (Gilded catfish) Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii (Pimelodidae, Siluriformes) is a commercially valuable migratory catfish performing the largest migration in freshwaters: from the Amazonian headwaters in the Andean foothills (breeding area) to the Amazon estuary (nursery area). In spite of its importance to inform management and conservation efforts, the genetic variability of this species has only recently begun to be studied. The aim of the present work was to determine the population genetic structure of B. rousseauxii in two regions: the Upper Madera Basin (five locations in the Bolivian Amazon) and the Western Amazon Basin (one regional sample from the Uyucalí-Napo-Marañon-Amazon basin, Peru). Length polymorphism at nine microsatellite loci (284 individuals) was used to determine genetic variability and to identify the most probable panmictic units (using a Bayesian approach), after a significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed in the overall dataset (Western Amazon + Upper Madera). Bayesian analyses revealed at least three clusters in admixture in the five locations sampled in the Bolivian Amazon, whereas only two of these clusters were observed in the Western Amazon. Considering the migratory behaviour of B. rousseauxii, different life history strategies, including homing, are proposed to explain the cluster distribution. Our results are discussed in the light of the numerous threats to the species survival in the Madera basin, in particular dam and reservoir construction. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Crop wild relatives possess important traits, therefore ex situ and in situ conservation efforts are essential to maintain sufficient options for crop improvement. Bolivia is a centre of wild relative diversity for several crops, among them potato, which is an important staple worldwide and the principal food crop in this country. Despite their relevance for plant breeding, limited knowledge exists about their in situ conservation status. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and distribution modelling with the software Maxent to better understand geographic patterns of endemic wild potato diversity in Bolivia. In combination with threat layers, we assessed the conservation status of all endemic species, 21 in total. We prioritised areas for in situ conservation by using complementary reserve selection and excluded 25% of the most-threatened collection sites because costs to implement conservation measures at those locations may be too high compared to other areas. Some 70% (15 of 21 species) has a preliminary vulnerable status or worse according to IUCN red list distribution criteria. Our results show that four of these species would require special conservation attention because they were only observed in <15 locations and are highly threatened by human accessibility, fires and livestock pressure. Although highest species richness occurs in south-central Bolivia, in the departments Santa Cruz and Chuquisaca, the first priority area for in situ conservation according to our reserve selection exercise is central Bolivia, Cochabamba; this area is less threatened than the potato wild relatives' hotspot in south-central Bolivia. Only seven of the 21 species were observed in protected areas. To improve coverage of potato wild relatives' distribution by protected areas, we recommend starting inventories in parks and reserves with high modelled diversity. Finally, to improve ex situ conservation, we targeted areas for germplasm collection of species with <5 accessions conserved in genebanks. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.","Pseudoplatystoma species are highly prized South American Pimelodid migratory catfishes. Until recently, their taxonomy was not clearly established, with discrepancies between morphological and molecular analyses. Here, Pseudoplatystoma species from the Peruvian Amazon were characterized at the molecular level from a sample representing the observed range of their color pattern variations in the study area. Analyses were performed using seven microsatellite loci for 103 specimens and, for part of them (52), using sequences of two regions of their mitochondrial genome [Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI) and Control Region (CR)]. Factorial correspondence analysis and assignment tests based on microsatellite polymorphism showed that the specimens originally identified as P. punctifer belonged to two different gene pools highly differentiated from P. tigrinum. Morphological examination identified two different morphotypes (with and without black stripes), suggesting the existence of two distinct taxa within P. punctifer. This result was corroborated by the ML tree based on CR sequences, where all individuals but four clustered in a similar way as in the FCA and Bayesian assignment tests. For these four individuals, mitochondrial introgression or retention of ancestral polymorphism was likely. In contrast, the ML tree based on COI sequences showed that reciprocal monophyly was not yet achieved for this marker for the two P. punctifer taxa. The existence of three sympatric species of Pseudoplatystoma in the Peruvian Amazon is discussed in relation to their molecular characteristics, color patterns and ecology. Evolutionary scenarios regarding their divergence are hypothesized. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Sampling animal populations with camera traps has become increasingly popular over the past two decades, particularly for species that are cryptic, elusive, exist at low densities or range over large areas. The results have been widely used to estimate population size and density. We analyzed data from 13 camera trap surveys conducted at five sites across the Kaa-Iya landscape, Bolivian Chaco, for jaguar, puma, ocelot and lowland tapir. We compared two spatially explicit capture-recapture (SCR) software packages: secr, a likelihood-based approach, and SPACECAP, a Bayesian approach, both of which are implemented within the R environment and can be used to estimate animal density from photographic records of individual animals that simultaneously employ spatial information about the capture location relative to the sample location. As a non-spatial analysis, we used the program CAPTURE 2 to estimate abundance from the capture-recapture records of individuals identified through camera trap photos combined with an ad hoc estimation of the effective survey area to estimate density. SCR methods estimated jaguar population densities from 0.31 to 1.82 individuals per 100km 2 across the Kaa-Iya sites; puma from 0.36 to 7.99; ocelot from 1.67 to 51.7; and tapir from 7.38 to 42.9. Density estimates using either secr or SPACECAP were generally lower than the estimates generated using the non-spatial method for all surveys and species; and density estimates using SPACECAP were generally lower than that using secr. We recommend using either secr or SPACECAP because the spatially explicit methods are not biased by an informal estimation of an effective survey area. Although SPACECAP and secr are less sensitive than non-spatial methods to the size of the grid used for sampling, we recommend grid sizes several times larger than the average home range (known or estimated) of the target species. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.","Chenopodium is a large and morphologically variable genus of annual and perennial herbs with an almost global distribution. All subgenera and most sections of Chenopodium were sampled along with other genera of Chenopodieae, Atripliceae and Axyrideae across the subfamily Chenopodioideae (Chenopodiaceae), totalling to 140 taxa. Using Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of the non-coding trnL-F (cpDNA) and nuclear ITS regions, we provide a comprehensive picture of relationships of Chenopodium sensu lato. The genus as broadly classified is highly paraphyletic within Chenopodioideae, consisting of five major clades. Compared to previous studies, the tribe Dysphanieae with three genera Dysphania, Teloxys and Suckleya (comprising the aromatic species of Chenopodium s.l.) is now shown to form one of the early branches in the tree of Chenopodioideae. We further recognize the tribe Spinacieae to include Spinacia, several species of Chenopodium, and the genera Monolepis and Scleroblitum. The Chenopodium rubrum and the Ch. murale-clades were newly discovered as distinct major lineages but their relationships within Chenopodioideae will need further evaluation. Based on our results, we suggest the delimitation of Chenopodium to include Einadia and Rhagodia because these are part of the crown group composed of species of subg. Chenopodium that appear sister to the Atripliceae. The tetraploid crops such as Ch. berlandieri subsp. nuttalliae and Ch. quinoa also belong to Chenopodium sensu stricto. Trees derived from trnL-F and ITS were incongruent within this shallow crown group clade. Possible biological causes are discussed, including allopolyploidization. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Solanum morelliforme is an epiphytic wild potato (Solanum section Petota) species widely distributed throughout central Mexico to Honduras. A strikingly disjunct (approximately 4,000 km) population was recently discovered in Bolivia, representing the first record of this species in South America, and the first species in the section growing in both North and Central America and in South America. Our maximum entropy analysis of 19 climatic variables matches the occurrence of the South American locality with great precision. It demonstrates the strong predictive quality of this procedure and suggests similar localities where this species may be found, especially along the eastern slopes of the Andes in the Yungas region of southern Peru and Bolivia. In addition, the presence of S. morelliforme in South America adds to emerging data from yet other sources to question long-held hypotheses of the origin of section Petota in North and Central America. © Copyright 2011 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.","The uncertainty in the redshift distributions of galaxies has a significant potential impact on the cosmological parameter values inferred from multi-band imaging surveys. The accuracy of the photometric redshifts measured in these surveys depends not only on the quality of the flux data, but also on a number of modeling assumptions that enter into both the training set and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting methods of photometric redshift estimation. In this work we focus on the latter, considering two types of modeling uncertainties: uncertainties in the SED template set and uncertainties in the magnitude and type priors used in a Bayesian photometric redshift estimation method. We find that SED template selection effects dominate over magnitude prior errors. We introduce a method for parameterizing the resulting ignorance of the redshift distributions, and for propagating these uncertainties to uncertainties in cosmological parameters. © 2011.

Because they are affected by various threats such as habitat destruction, chytrid fungus, climate change,invasive species and human use, different approaches are needed for their conservation. In this paper we examine patterns of alpha diversity, endemism and threatened species distributions of amphibians in Bolivia. We modeled distribution data using ecological niche modeling implemented with MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy Modeling). In contrast with previous studies, we validated each individual map with specialists. Important areas for amphibian conservation were defined by overlapping species richness, endemism richness and concentration of threatened species, and then excluding all unsuitable habitats. Our goal was to identify high-priority sites for the conservation of amphibians in Bolivia. We discuss a place-based strategy (identification of priority areas) and the need for further non place-based strategies. We highlight the importance of strengthening two existing protected areas that together host up to 40% of Bolivia's threatened amphibian species, and we propose alternative strategies such as ex situ conservation for those species not covered by the priority areas. Bolivia's General Directorate for Biodiversity and Protected Areas (in Spanish, Dirección General de Biodiversidad y Áreas Protegidas (DGBAP)) and Bolivian experts are jointly using the here presented results to define a national strategy of amphibian conservation for safeguarding this important element of Bolivia's biodiversity. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V.2001.","Understanding large-scale patterns of beta- and alpha diversity is essential for ecoregional conservation planning. Using the 110,000 km2 shallow basin of the Beni savannas of northeastern Bolivia, we examined the spatial patterns of biological diversity of four taxonomic groups (bats, palms, reptiles, and amphibians). Since the Beni savannas are shaped by cycles of drought and flood, and farming, which, together with topography, create a mosaic of sub-ecoregions from Amazonian forests to aquatic vegetation, we hypothesize that this landscape heterogeneity results in a high turnover in species composition across sub-ecoregions. We compiled species lists for each taxon and modeled the potential distribution of each species using the algorithm MaxEnt. For those species whose modeled potential distribution produced incongruous results, we built presence-absence maps. Using the potential distribution maps, we estimated the lists of species for each sub-ecoregion. In order to establish present similarities in species composition between sub-ecoregions, we constructed dendrograms using cluster analysis of presence-absence matrices. The sub-ecoregions associated with the Moxos (southern part of the Beni savannas) were richer than the sub-ecoregions composing the Beni Cerrado (northern part of the Beni savannas). Centers of species richness were detected in the savanna-type sub-ecoregions (bats and reptiles) or associated with the Várzea forests (palms and amphibians). A south-north gradient in the pattern of distribution of four taxonomic groups was also recorded. The results suggest that the patterns of biological diversity partially respond to the mosaic arrangement of the landscape. Future exercises on conservation planning will point to total target areas about 5,000 km2. This area seems to be sufficient to contain the biological richness of the region at least for the taxa analyzed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","We investigated demographic history and population structuring of Colossoma macropomum sampled from 14 localities in the Amazon basin and the Bolivian sub-basin; the two basins are separated by a series of 16 rapids. Although genetically differentiated, IMa analyses suggest non-zero bi-directional migration rates, and inter-basin divergence of approximately 17 thousand years ago. Analyses in BEAST indicated that Bolivian C. macropomum has been demographically stable except for a moderate population increase in the last 12 thousand years, while Amazonian C. macropomum has been experiencing demographic growth over the last 350 thousand years, resulting in approximately one order of magnitude increase in coalescent Ne. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","The quality of climate models has largely been overlooked as a possible source of uncertainty that may affect the outcomes of species distribution models, especially in the tropics, where comparatively few climatic stations are available. We compared the geographical discrepancies and potential conservation implications of using two different climate models (Saga and Worldclim) in combination with the species modelling approach Maxent in Bolivia. We estimated ranges of selected bird and fern species biogeographically restricted to either humid montane forest of the northern Bolivian Andes or seasonal dry tropical forests (in the Andes and southern lowlands). Saga and Worldclim predicted roughly similar climate patterns of temperature that were significantly correlated. Precipitation layers of both climate models were also roughly similar, but showed important differences. Species ranges estimated with Worldclim and Saga likewise produced different results. Ranges of species endemic to humid montane forests estimated with Saga had higher AUC (Area under the curve) values than those estimated with Worldclim, which for example predicted the occurrence of humid montane forest bird species near Lake Titicaca, an area that is clearly unsuitable for these species. Likewise, Worldclim overpredicted the occurrence of fern and bird species in the lowlands of the Chapare region and well south of the Andean Elbow, where more seasonal biomes occur. By contrast, Saga predictions were coherent with the known distribution of humid montane forests in the northern Bolivian Andes. Estimated ranges of species endemic to seasonal dry tropical forests predicted with Saga and Worldclim were not statistically different in most cases. However, detailed comparisons revealed that Saga was able to distinguish fragments of seasonal dry tropical forests in rain-shadow valleys of the northern Bolivian Andes, whereas Worldclim was not. These differences highlight the neglected influence of climate layers on modelling results and the importance of using the most accurate climate data available when modelling species distributions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To resolve infra- and intergeneric relationships among Fosterella and their putative allies, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis based on sequence data from four chloroplast DNA regions (matK gene, rps16 intron, atpB-rbcL and psbB-psbH intergenic spacers). Sequences were generated for 96 accessions corresponding to 60 species from 18 genera. Among these, 57 accessions represented 22 of the 31 recognized Fosterella species and one undescribed morphospecies. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods yielded well-resolved phylogenies. The monophyly of Fosterella was strongly supported, as was its sister relationship with a clade comprising Deuterocohnia, Dyckia and Encholirium. Six distinct evolutionary lineages were distinguished within Fosterella. Character mapping indicated that parallel evolution of identical character states is common in the genus. Relationships between species and lineages are discussed in the context of morphological, ecological and biogeographical data as well as the results of a previous amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) study. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of the present study was to assess antibody seroprevalences against rabies in dogs vaccinated under field conditions and other factors that might influence the success of the on-going rabies control programmes in an endemic area of the disease, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia. All 240 study animals, selected using area-stratified random sampling, were investigated in April 2007. Test prevalences were adjusted for the imperfect test characteristics using the Rogan-Gladen estimator (deterministic and stochastic functions) and Bayesian inference. Ninety-four of the tested 240 vaccinated dogs were classified as test-positive for rabies-specific antibodies. With regard to adjusted overall antibody seroprevalence, Bayesian true prevalence estimates (41%, 95% CI: 37-46%) were lower than both of the Rogan-Gladen estimates. The effect of various epidemiological factors on post-vaccination response was also assessed. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Conservationists are increasingly relying on distribution models to predict where species are likely to occur, especially in poorly-surveyed but biodiverse areas. Modeling is challenging in these cases because locality data necessary for model formation are often scarce and spatially imprecise. To identify methods best suited to modeling in these conditions, we compared the success of three algorithms (Maxent, Mahalanobis Typicalities and Random Forests) at predicting distributions of eight bird and eight mammal species endemic to the eastern slopes of the central Andes. We selected study species to have a range of locality sample sizes representative of the data available for endemic species of this region and also that vary in their distribution characteristics. We found that for species that are known from moderate numbers (N = 38-94) of localities, the three methods performed similarly for species with restricted distributions but Maxent and Random Forests yielded better results for species with wider distributions. For species with small numbers of sample localities (N = 5-21), Maxent produced the most consistently successful results, followed by Random Forests and then Mahalanobis Typicalities. Because evaluation statistics for models derived from few localities can be suspect due to the poor spatial representation of the evaluation data, we corroborated these results with review by scientists familiar with the species in the field. Overall, Maxent appears to be the most capable method for modeling distributions of Andean bird and mammal species because of the consistency of results in varying conditions, although the other methods have strengths in certain situations. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Today, the Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTF) of eastern South America occur as large, well-defined nuclei (e.g. Caatinga in the northeast) and as smaller enclaves within other vegetations (e.g. Cerrado and Chaco). In order to infer the way the present SDTF distribution was attained, the genetic structure of Astronium urundeuva, a tree confined to SDTF, was assessed using two chloroplast spacers and nine microsatellite loci. Five haplotypes were identified, whose distribution was spatially structured. The distribution of the two most common and divergent haplotypes suggested former vicariance and progressive divergence due to isolation. More recent range expansions of these two lineages subsequently occurred, leading to a secondary contact at the southern limit of the Caatinga SDTF nucleus. The multilocus-Bayesian approach using microsatellites consistently identified three groups of populations (Northeast, Central and Southwest). Isolation by distance was found in Northeast and Southwest groups whereas admixture was detected in the Central group, located at the transition between Caatinga and Cerrado domains. All together, the results support the existence of range expansions and secondary contact in the Central group. This study provides arguments that favour the existence of a previously more continuous formation of SDTF in eastern South America. © 2008 The Authors.","In this paper a procedure for the estimation of the lithological description of the stratigraphical formation by wells is described; in this procedure the results of wireline measurements and a litho-facies database are combined. The litho-facies are defined from log values and histograms and are translated into gaussian distributions. In order to optimise type lithologies we have used the discriminant function referred to as the Bayes rule. In addition, several logic rules have been applied in order to discriminate between different litho-facies (test of shale volume and bore hole conditions). The wireline logs used are density, sonic transit time, gamma ray, spontaneous potential and resistivity. The litho-facies groups represented in this database are sandstone, calcareous sand, shaly sand and shale. The procedure has been applied to two wells in a fluvial environment (sand-shales series). The results have been compared with drilling rates, cutting descriptions and Dipmeter information. For each level a lithological column can be produced with a computed probability. The examples are used for the study of sequences and facies in the Tertiary formations in the foreland Chaco basin of Bolivia (latitude 19-20°S). ©
